The existing literature is deeply divided, with some studies\nfinding that voters punish incumbents for disaster-related damages, while\nothers find they reward them for relief efforts. This paper investigates the\nelectoral consequences of natural disasters for incumbent mayors, broader\nelectoral dynamics, and the long-term political ambition of officeholders. The\nstudy leverages a comprehensive panel dataset of over 10,000 candidate-election\nobservations in U.S. mayoral races from 1989 to 2021, combining detailed\nelection data with a global registry of disaster events. To identify causal\neffects, the analysis employs a robust dynamic two-way fixed-effects\nevent-study design, validated by extensive pre-trend and placebo tests. The\nfindings reveal that the electoral impact of disasters is highly conditional on\ntheir timing. A disaster that strikes in the same quarter as an election\nprovides a significant electoral boost to incumbents, increasing their vote\nshare by over 6 percentage points. However, disasters consistently suppress\nvoter turnout, reducing it by an average of 1.4 percentage points. In a novel\nfinding, the analysis demonstrates that the experience of managing a disaster\nsignificantly increases an incumbent's likelihood of seeking re-election in the\nsubsequent cycle by as much as 12 percentage points. These findings help\nreconcile conflicting theories of retrospective voting by highlighting the\ncritical role of voter myopia and salience. They also reveal a previously\nundocumented channel through which crises shape political careers, suggesting\nthat disaster management is not only a test of governance but also a catalyst\nfor political ambition.

The problem of designing\nrevenue-optimal auctions based on reserve price has drawn much attention in the\nauction design community. Although they have been extensively studied, most\ndevelopments rely on the significant assumption that the target audience of the\nsale is directly reachable by the auctioneer, while a large portion of bidders\nin the economic network unaware of the sale are omitted. This work follows the\ndiffusion auction design, which aims to extend the target audience of optimal\nauction theory to all entities in economic networks. We investigate the design\nof simple and provably near-optimal network auctions via reserve price. Using\nBayesian approximation analysis, we provide a simple and explicit form of the\nreserve price function tailored to the most representative network auction.

Submitted as an arXiv preprint. All code and\n  experiment details included in appendix", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on\nalgorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,\nhuman-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make\nunexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or\nimmediate reward. This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might\nbe crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms\nanalogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to\nimprove an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen\nchanges.

Third, we\nfind that procurement pathways depend on vehicle price. More expensive preowned\nvehicles are purchased directly from commercial dealers, while less expensive\npreowned vehicles are purchased from private sellers. These procurement\npathways matter because qualification for IRA incentives necessitates\npurchasing solely from commercial dealers.

Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam\ninformation, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage\nprediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is\ncost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity\nresults in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited\nvariability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of\nsubstantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished\ngeneralizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these\nobstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based\nfeature compression and disentangled representation learning.

The current paradigms for timely data\nprocessing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing\nplaces resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing\nanalyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream\nprocessing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource\nprovisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas\nexcess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as\nthreshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance\ndegrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL)\noffers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime\nadaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive\nmachine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that\nminimize their accuracy.

One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the\ndevelopment of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In\nthis work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene\nunderstanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to\ninvestigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of\nseveral Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that\nchoosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the\nmodel for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation\nallows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.\nIn the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,\nmean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are\nimproved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08Backbone\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728BDD100k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BDD100k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5e73\u5747IoU\u548c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u573a\u666f\u548c\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

This\nalgorithm differs from the standard Kmeans algorithm by employing the time\nseries variation of the panel rather than relying merely on time averages of\nobservations. To address the challenge of testing hypotheses that depend on\ndata-driven cluster estimates, we adopt a selective conditional inference\nframework. Specifically, we derive a Wald-type test statistic for pairwise\nequality and show that the limiting distribution of its square root conditional\non the estimated cluster structure is that of a truncated $\\chi$ random\nvariable. We characterize the associated truncation set as a polyhedron in the\ndata space. As a test of the C-EPA hypothesis, we propose a $p$-value\ncombination method which aggregates the evidence against the pairwise equality\nand overall EPA null hypotheses.

However, these systems remain fallback-grade--rural-only,\nbandwidth-limited, and fully dependent on Earth-based mobile cores for\nidentity, session, and policy control.

We present the first end-to-end system architecture for a fully orbital\ntelco, integrating electronically steered phased arrays with 1000-beam\ncapacity, space-based deployment of 5G core functions (UPF, AMF), and\ninter-satellite laser mesh backhaul.

We believe this\nis a first step for making LCMs debuggable and thus paving the road for new\napproaches for systematically fixing problems in LCMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u63ed\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff08LCMs\uff09\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLCMs\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLCMs\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u67e5\u8be2\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709AI\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8eLCMs\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9LCMs\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4f7fLCMs\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To\naddress this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive\ndataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and\nfacilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In\ndoing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of\nstate-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193\nwebsites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail\nwebsites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:\nSAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits\nto support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial\nevaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less\nthan 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in\nlagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying\ncurrent-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore\ninvestigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that\na fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in\nperformance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from\n20% to 76%.

On the other\nhand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,\nthe more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy.

Deploying large models closer to\nthe data and users has become a key research area to address these issues.\nHowever, applying these models directly often entails significant difficulties,\nsuch as model mismatching, resource constraints, and energy inefficiency.\nAutomated design of customized models is necessary, but it faces three key\nchallenges, namely, the high cost of centralized model customization,\nimbalanced performance from user heterogeneity, and suboptimal performance from\ndata heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose ACME, an adaptive customization\napproach of Transformer-based large models via distributed systems. To avoid\nthe low cost-efficiency of centralized methods, ACME employs a bidirectional\nsingle-loop distributed system to progressively achieve fine-grained\ncollaborative model customization. In order to better match user heterogeneity,\nit begins by customizing the backbone generation and identifying the Pareto\nFront under model size constraints to ensure optimal resource utilization.\nSubsequently, it performs header generation and refines the model using data\ndistribution-based personalized architecture aggregation to match data\nheterogeneity. Evaluation on different datasets shows that ACME achieves\ncost-efficient models under model size constraints. Compared to centralized\nsystems, data transmission volume is reduced to 6 percent.

It\ninvolves breaking down the input into units that are later passed to the\nlanguage model stack to learn high-dimensional representations used in various\ncontexts, from classification to generation. However, the output of these\ntokenizers is often longer than that traditionally used in compilers and\ninterpreters. This could result in undesirable effects, such as increased\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we investigate the effect of merging the\nhidden representations of subtokens that belong to the same semantic unit, such\nas subtokens that form a single identifier. We propose two strategies: one\nbased on averaging the representations and another that leverages a\nlearning-based approach. Both methods can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting language models for code. We conduct experiments using six language\nmodels for code: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXCoder, CdoeT5, CodeT5+ (220M),\nand CodeT5+ (770M), across three software engineering tasks: vulnerability\ndetection, code classification, and code translation. Results show that these\nstrategies can reduce the number of floating-point operations by $1\\%$ to\n$19\\%$.

As LLM agents are increasingly\ndeployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of\ntolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.\n  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven\ncoordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are\ninherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive\nleaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus,\nforcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high\nlatency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader\ncan be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are\navailable, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives\na quorum of votes.\n  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized\nconsensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate\nanswers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these\nanswers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture\nenables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and\nconsistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust\naggregation techniques.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates\nByzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "DecentLLMs\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5171\u8bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6076\u610f\uff08Byzantine\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7406\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u7406\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u6280\u672f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDecentLLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bb9\u5fcdByzantine\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "DecentLLMs\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks\ncontext from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects\nhallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that\nsupports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to\ndebugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up\nchats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of\nits responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set.\nThrough ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and\nmodeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise\nText-to-SQL solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001Text-to-SQL\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u52a9\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Text-to-SQL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u6784\u5efa\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u5f00\u53d1Text-to-SQL\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6392\u540d\u3001\u7ea0\u9519\uff09\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "result": "\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6bcf\u5468\u6709300\u591a\u540d\u7528\u6237\uff0c53%\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002"}}

The semantics of BPPLs are usually mathematically complex and\nunable to reason about desirable properties such as expected values and\nindependence of random variables. To reason about these properties in a\nnon-Bayesian setting, probabilistic separation logics such as PSL and Lilac\ninterpret separating conjunction as probabilistic independence of random\nvariables. However, no existing separation logic can handle Bayesian updating,\nwhich is the key distinguishing feature of BPPLs.\n  To close this gap, we introduce Bayesian separation logic (BaSL), a\nprobabilistic separation logic that gives semantics to BPPL. We prove an\ninternal version of Bayes' theorem using a result in measure theory known as\nthe Rokhlin-Simmons disintegration theorem. Consequently, BaSL can model\nprobabilistic programming concepts such as Bayesian updating, unnormalised\ndistribution, conditional distribution, soft constraint, conjugate prior and\nimproper prior while maintaining modularity via the frame rule. The model of\nBaSL is based on a novel instantiation of Kripke resource monoid via\n$\\sigma$-finite measure spaces over the Hilbert cube, and the semantics of\nHoare triple is compatible with an existing denotational semantics of BPPL\nbased on the category of $s$-finite kernels.

However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion.

However, little is\nknown about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in\nreal-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how\nidentity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five\ndifferent high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,\npolitics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,\ngender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For\ninstance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different\nstandards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same\nsymptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a\nconservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by\nolder (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for\nnon-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men.

In Raft, the servers play one of three roles:\nleader, follower, or candidate. The leader receives client requests, determines\nthe processing order, and replicates them to the followers. When the leader\nfails, the service must elect a new leader to continue processing requests,\nduring which the service experiences an out-of-service (OTS) time. The OTS time\nis directly influenced by election parameters, such as heartbeat interval and\nelection timeout. However, traditional approaches, such as Raft, often struggle\nto effectively tune these parameters, particularly under fluctuating network\nconditions, leading to increased OTS time and reduced service responsiveness.\nTo address this, we propose Dynatune, a mechanism that dynamically adjusts\nRaft's election parameters based on network metrics such as round-trip time and\npacket loss rates measured via heartbeats. By adapting to changing network\nenvironments, Dynatune significantly reduces the leader failure detection and\nOTS time without altering Raft's core mechanisms or introducing additional\ncommunication overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that Dynatune reduces\nthe leader failure detection and OTS times by 80% and 45%, respectively,\ncompared with Raft, while maintaining high availability even under dynamic\nnetwork conditions. These findings confirm that Dynatune effectively enhances\nthe performance and reliability of SMR services in various network scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Dynatune\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574Raft\u9009\u4e3e\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRaft\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u6ce2\u52a8\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u9009\u4e3e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynatune\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5f80\u8fd4\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4e22\u5305\u7387\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574Raft\u9009\u4e3e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDynatune\u5c06\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u522b\u51cf\u5c1180%\u548c45%\u3002", "conclusion": "Dynatune\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SMR\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Computing and storing\nconnectivity information is a major bottleneck for visualization algorithms,\naffecting both time and memory performance. Recent task-parallel data\nstructures address this by precomputing connectivity information at runtime\nwhile the analysis algorithm executes, effectively hiding computation costs and\nimproving performance. However, existing approaches are CPU-bound, forcing the\ndata structure and analysis algorithm to compete for the same computational\nresources, limiting potential speedups. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel task-parallel approach optimized for heterogeneous CPU-GPU\nsystems.

As a result, platforms that host models and\ndatasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular\nplatforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no\nsign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained\nmodels, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or\nmalicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical\nto understand the origin and development of these components to better detect\npotential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by\nthis, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,\nwhich are core components of the LLM supply chain.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies.

While CGTs offer potential\nproductivity enhancements, their effectiveness across diverse user groups have\nnot been sufficiently investigated. Objectives: We hypothesize that developers'\ninteractions with CGTs vary based on gender, influencing task outcomes and\ncognitive load, as prior research suggests that gender differences can affect\ntechnology use and cognitive processing. Methods: The study will employ a\nmixed-subjects design with 54 participants, evenly divided by gender for a\ncounterbalanced design. Participants will complete two programming tasks\n(medium to hard difficulty) with only CGT assistance and then with only\ninternet access. Task orders and conditions will be counterbalanced to mitigate\norder effects. Data collection will include cognitive load surveys, screen\nrecordings, and task performance metrics such as completion time, code\ncorrectness, and CGT interaction behaviors. Statistical analyses will be\nconducted to identify statistically significant differences in CGT usage.\nExpected Contributions: Our work can uncover gender differences in CGT\ninteraction and performance among developers. Our findings can inform future\nCGT designs and help address usability and potential disparities in interaction\npatterns across diverse user groups.

However, the severe wireless signal attenuation in\nchallenging underground environments and the costly acquisition of channel\nstate information (CSI) make large-scale WPUCNs economically infeasible in\npractice. To address this challenge, we introduce flexible unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) into WPUCNs, leading to UAV-enabled WPUCN systems. In this\nsystem, a UAV is first charged by a terrestrial hybrid access point (HAP), then\nflies to the monitoring area to wirelessly charge UDs. Afterwards, the UAV\ncollects data from the UDs and finally returns to the HAP for data offloading.\nBased on the proposed UAV-enabled WPUCN system, we first propose its energy\nconsumption model and a hybrid wireless energy transfer (WET) approach (i.e.,\nUDs can harvest energy from both the HAP and the UAV) relying on full-CSI and\nCSI-free multi-antenna beamforming. Then, we formulate and address a time\nallocation problem to minimize the energy consumption of UAV, while ensuring\nthat the throughput requirements of all UDs are met and all sensor data is\noffloaded. Through simulations of a realistic farming scenario, we demonstrate\nthat the proposed hybrid WET approach outperforms other WET approaches, with\nperformance gains influenced by the number of antennas, communication distance,\nnumber of UDs, and underground conditions. Additionally, under the optimized\ntime allocation, we found that the proposed hybrid WET approach based on a\nCSI-free multi-antenna scheme achieves the lowest UAV's energy consumption\namong all WET mechanisms, thereby enabling sustainable underground monitoring\nin WPUCNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u7535\u5730\u4e0b\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\uff08WPUCN\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u65e0\u7ebf\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff08WET\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u4e25\u91cd\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21WPUCN\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u5230WPUCN\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408WET\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7ed3\u5408HAP\u548cUAV\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316UAV\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u6df7\u5408WET\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001UD\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u914d\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCSI-free\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6df7\u5408WET\u80fd\u8017\u6700\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3aWPUCN\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This\npaper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies\nspatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,\nend-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D\nconvolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,\ntermed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term\nspatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models\ndirectional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing\nkernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,\nyielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance\nshifts.

Efforts to detect and\nmitigate such attacks have focused primarily on the control plane while\ndata-plane signals remain largely overlooked. In particular, change in\npropagation delay caused by rerouting offers a promising signal: the change is\nunavoidable and the increased propagation delay is directly observable from the\naffected networks.

We\nobserve that for 86% of victim-attacker country pairs in the world, mid-attack\ndelays exceed pre-attack delays by at least 25% in real deployments, making\ndelay-based hijack detection promising.

In DFQ, the quantization model must be\ncalibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic\nsamples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global\nand local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data\nquality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant\ndifference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the\nquantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance\ndegradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a\npipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).\nSpecifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,\neffectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and\ninference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the\nquantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the\nfull-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves\nremarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par\nwith models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T\nwith 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically\nevaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects.\nThe model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34\nSpearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground\ntruth story points.

In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as\nit can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although\nautomated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements,\nevaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency)\nremains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can\nhelp automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where\nrequirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs\nto investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer\ninterviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with\nthe quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also\nexplored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the\nsemantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar\nto humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower\ndiversity and creativity.

Copyright @ IEEE 2025", "summary": "The evolution towards future generation of mobile systems and fixed wireless\nnetworks is primarily driven by the urgency to support high-bandwidth and\nlow-latency services across various vertical sectors. This endeavor is fueled\nby smartphones as well as technologies like industrial internet of things,\nextended reality (XR), and human-to-machine (H2M) collaborations for fostering\nindustrial and social revolutions like Industry 4.0/5.0 and Society 5.0. To\nensure an ideal immersive experience and avoid cyber-sickness for users in all\nthe aforementioned usage scenarios, it is typically challenging to synchronize\nXR content from a remote machine to a human collaborator according to their\nhead movements across a large geographic span in real-time over communication\nnetworks. Thus, we propose a novel H2M collaboration scheme where the human's\nhead movements are predicted ahead with highly accurate models like\nbidirectional long short-term memory networks to orient the machine's camera in\nadvance.

This workshop\npaper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not\nonly improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,\nbut it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT\nmodel for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar\nsignificant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for\nclassifications in the affective dimension.

However,\nlimited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised\nwords in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.\nEnhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to\nbetter inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and\nfacilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary\nstep towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription\ndata contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The\nfindings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily\nequate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular\ntokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis\nalso identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the\nclassification but was not semantically meaningful to the class.

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources.

Second, AlphaCC adopts a modified\nattention-based encoder based on AlphaFold to model dependencies within and\nacross token sequences. Finally, unlike AlphaFold's protein structure\nprediction task, AlphaCC computes similarity scores between token sequences\nthrough a late interaction strategy and performs binary classification to\ndetermine code clone pairs.

These tests are crucial not\nonly for ensuring patches work, but also for helping developers understand how\nvulnerabilities can be exploited. Generating PoV tests is a challenging\nproblem, requiring reasoning about the flow of control and data through deeply\nnested levels of a program.\n  We present FaultLine, an LLM agent workflow that uses a set of carefully\ndesigned reasoning steps, inspired by aspects of traditional static and dynamic\nprogram analysis, to automatically generate PoV test cases. Given a software\nproject with an accompanying vulnerability report, FaultLine 1) traces the flow\nof an input from an externally accessible API (\"source\") to the \"sink\"\ncorresponding to the vulnerability, 2) reasons about the conditions that an\ninput must satisfy in order to traverse the branch conditions encountered along\nthe flow, and 3) uses this reasoning to generate a PoV test case in a\nfeedback-driven loop. FaultLine does not use language-specific static or\ndynamic analysis components, which enables it to be used across programming\nlanguages.\n  To evaluate FaultLine, we collate a challenging multi-lingual dataset of 100\nknown vulnerabilities in Java, C and C++ projects.

While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in\nfacial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual\ndifferences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates\nthe phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit\nsignificant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same\nstimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we\nhypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN\nclassifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.\nTo examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling\nmethod to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision\nboundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,\nconstructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments.

Current 3D\nscene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,\nparticularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles\nand interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and\npowerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects\nusing natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D\nembeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that\ncaptures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships.

A semantic search engine (OpenAI's\ntext-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts.\nThirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select\nthe best-matching ICPC-2 code.

To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training.

Most available datasets are in English, but\neven among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a\nresult, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining\ntheir annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other\nlanguages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via\nartificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by\nconstructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media\nposts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three\nhuman annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the\nremaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability\nand model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal\nideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained\nsentiment and emotion classifiers.

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to\nfilter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy.\nFurthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our\nagent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the\n\"extinction burst\" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality\nis a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a\npsychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5956\u52b1CAIS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CAIS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u611f\u5b98\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff081-Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5a74\u513f-\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cCAIS\u6210\u529f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u786e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u201c\u6d88\u9000\u7206\u53d1\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u662f\u53d1\u5c55\u7a33\u5065\u4ee3\u7406\u611f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable\ncapabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a\nfundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from\ncomparatively limited input.

The\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a\nstreaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new\nopportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting\nthese models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets\nfor retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and\nthe risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose\nDD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a\nDepthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature\nextraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective\nfine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority.

This paper introduces\nFST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport\nTaekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick\ndetection and scoring.

The results demonstrate that\nwith only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.\nThese findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both\ncross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset.

Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation.

Without explicit cues, models identified the\nfunctional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could\nrepresent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.\nStudy 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched\nsystems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;\nLLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.\nInsofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion\nthat LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical\nassociations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately\nrepresent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may\nlack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3).

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical\naerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,\nstereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite\ntests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric\naerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive\nevaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of\nthe UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results\nshow these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very\nsparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with\ncompleteness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher\ncomputational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose\nestimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and\nlarge sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric\ncomplexity.

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories.

Then, k-means\nclustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by\na Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments\nvalidate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the\nStanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its\neffectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency.

Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality\nof the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.\nThe method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation\nof paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional\ndiffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices\nand mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training\nprocess of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show\nthat our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.\nMoreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus\nenhancing the performance of downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u4e73\u817a\u65ad\u5c42\u5408\u6210\uff08DBT\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u80bf\u5757\u5206\u5272\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "DBT\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u80bf\u5757\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u7b5b\u67e5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e73\u817a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bfc\u81f4\u80bf\u5757\u9690\u853d\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5f15\u5bfc\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9\u7684DBT\u5207\u7247\u548c\u80bf\u5757\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA\nremained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they\nwere allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented\nwith the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large\nmodels that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options\ntended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to\nexploiting the information in the options.

In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion\nstates based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with\na hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework.

However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the\nquality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two\nfundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct\nchecks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as\nassertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much\nprogress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic\nexecution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored\nproblem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of\nexpected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not\nexist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.\n  Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely\nused Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is\nthat Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated\ngeneration of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly\ndetailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how\nthe libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them.

Project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH/", "summary": "Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce\nspoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an\ninternal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans\ntypically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to\ncommunicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,\ncan lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR\nregimes.

In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting\nnarratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political\nreality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive\nmechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building\nupon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the\nGerman Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension\nof polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from\ntweets of opposing opinion groups.

To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually.

Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further\nintroduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient\ncross-modal interactions.

Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over\nimage-only training.

EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to\ndetect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across\nvaried underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to\noptimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining\ncompetitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100\nshow that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable\nreal-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring.

Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only\nsimplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on\nfull-resolution data.

Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a\ngiven term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of\nmany, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes\nin diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship\ndedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that\ntradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community\nby demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance\ntesting perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under\nmild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the\n$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical\nsignificance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the\nsaid negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We\nfurther demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to\nTF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection.

Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In\nparticular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the\nsimilarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven\nposes via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference\nstage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization\nintegrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for\nenhanced facial fidelity.

As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research\ntasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an\nessential component of effective intelligence.

MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large\nnumber of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh\nmodels with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.\nThe key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of\nmesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is\nachieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D\nvertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the\nstructure of articulated shapes.

It has proven\nespecially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending\ngenerative models. However, generative models perform better in image\ngeneration and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a\nconnection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the\nrepresentation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by\napproximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a\nsemantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for\nrecognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the\ndiffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition\nmodel. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of\nmask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and\ndiffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to\nincorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked\ntokens.

Existing alternatives typically require\neither per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training\nspecialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.\nSuch dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their\npractical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully\nleverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers\n(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates\nDiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal\nattention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while\npreserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis\nof DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly\nimproves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic\nrepresentations.

The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to\nsupervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on\n2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise\nand outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the\neffectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind\nPnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated\nblind PnP based correspondence learning approach.

In response, we present ORSANet, which\nintroduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary\nmulti-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn\nhigh-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic\nsegmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced\nfacial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric\nprior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.\nSecond, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal\npriors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively\nfuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within\ndifferent scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement\nLoss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,\nfurther enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions.

Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data.

In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction.

Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training\nparadigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical\nspace alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic\ntasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which\nachieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand\ntrajectories for action learning.

We\nintroduce $\\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework\nthat follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting\nthe rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian\nprimitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate\npartitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic\nmemory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse\nstage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy\nand landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,\nand (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine\ndense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.\nThrough comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real\nflight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive\nlocalization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while\neffectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6563\u5c04\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6Hi\u00b2-GSLoc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u6846\u67b6Hi\u00b2-GSLoc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7a00\u758f\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u9ad8\u65af\u7279\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5730\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u548c\u7a20\u5bc6\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u5339\u914d\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001GPU\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u3001\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "Hi\u00b2-GSLoc\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic\nfew-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA\nand then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base\norgans and novel organs.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).

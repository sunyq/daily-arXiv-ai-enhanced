### [1] [Signal Use and Emergent Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18920)
*Michael Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨自治代理如何通过通信信号协调活动并提升集体效率，使用NEC-DAC系统展示代理如何通过学习形成共享行为系统（类似文化），并分析不同通信策略对合作的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自治代理如何通过通信信号自我组织文化，以及文化对代理群体性能和合作的影响。

Method: 使用NEC-DAC系统，每个代理配备神经网络进行决策，分析不同社会结构（如权威层级）对文化形成和合作的影响。

Result: 文化对代理群体的性能和合作有显著影响，信号不仅促进文化涌现，还支持跨代传播。

Conclusion: 通信信号在代理群体中促进文化形成和传播，显著提升集体效率和合作。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [2] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在战略随机化方面的表现，提出了一种基于田忌赛马的零和游戏，并通过实验评估了不同LLMs的战略推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将随机化的认知决策与随机生成的机械过程混为一谈，导致评估不完整。本文旨在通过设计游戏实验，分离出LLMs的随机化决策能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于田忌赛马的零和游戏，其纳什均衡对应最大熵策略。通过多轮竞赛评估五种LLMs在不同提示风格下的表现。

Result: 较弱模型始终表现确定性策略，而较强模型在明确提示下增加随机化。面对较弱模型时，强模型采用确定性策略；面对同类时则趋近均衡策略。

Conclusion: LLMs的战略推理能力存在显著差异，提示改进抽象推理和自适应学习的潜力。实验代码已开源以确保可复现性。

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

### [3] [A Comment On "The Illusion of Thinking": Reframing the Reasoning Cliff as an Agentic Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18957)
*Sheraz Khan,Subha Madhavan,Kannan Natarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨大型推理模型（LRMs）在特定复杂度阈值后性能骤降的现象，认为这是实验设计限制而非模型推理能力的根本缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LRMs性能下降的真正原因，反驳将其归因于推理能力限制的观点。

Method: 通过工具增强模型能力，展示其在复杂任务中的表现，并与静态文本范式对比。

Result: 工具增强模型能解决远超原复杂度阈值的任务，证明性能下降是界面限制而非推理缺陷。

Conclusion: LRMs的‘思考幻觉’源于工具缺失，而非推理能力不足，需重新定义机器智能的衡量标准。

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

### [4] [From Rows to Yields: How Foundation Models for Tabular Data Simplify Crop Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19046)
*Filip Sabo,Michele Meroni,Maria Piles,Martin Claverie,Fanie Ferreira,Elna Van Den Berg,Francesco Collivignarelli,Felix Rembold*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TabPFN应用于南非次国家级作物产量预测，与传统ML模型相比表现优异，且调参更快、特征工程需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TabPFN在小到中型表格数据上的应用潜力，特别是在农业产量预测任务中的表现。

Method: 使用10天时间序列的EO和天气数据，按月聚合特征，通过留一年交叉验证评估TabPFN与6种ML模型和3种基线模型。

Result: TabPFN与ML模型精度相当，但调参更快、特征工程需求更低，实用性更强。

Conclusion: TabPFN因其高效性和易用性，更适合实际产量预测应用。

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

### [5] [Baba is LLM: Reasoning in a Game with Dynamic Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19095)
*Fien van Wetten,Aske Plaat,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在2D解谜游戏《Baba is You》中的表现，发现其在动态规则推理方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在结合语言能力和推理任务的游戏中的表现，以评估其复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 评估了六种LLMs，使用不同类型的提示（简单、规则扩展、动作扩展），并对两种模型（Mistral、OLMo）进行了微调。

Result: 较大模型（如GPT-4o）表现较好，但小模型难以理解游戏机制；微调提升了分析能力，但对解决方案生成帮助有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在动态规则推理方面仍有挑战，游戏可作为测试其推理能力的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

### [6] [Spiritual-LLM : Gita Inspired Mental Health Therapy In the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19185)
*Janak Kapuriya,Aman Singh,Jainendra Shukla,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合《薄伽梵歌》精神智慧与GPT-4o的新框架GITes，用于提升情绪支持效果，并通过新指标Spiritual Insight评估精神相关性。实验显示Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct模型在多项指标上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理健康支持系统仅基于用户当前情绪和情境生成回应，导致干预效果肤浅，无法满足深层情感需求。

Method: 整合《薄伽梵歌》精神智慧与GPT-4o，构建GITes数据集，并提出Spiritual Insight指标和LLM陪审团框架进行评估。

Result: Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct模型在ROUGE、METEOR等指标上提升显著，最高达126.53%。

Conclusion: 结合精神智慧的AI系统在提升用户满意度和支持效果方面潜力巨大，需进一步在真实患者群体中验证。

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

### [7] [Bayesian Evolutionary Swarm Architecture: A Formal Epistemic System Grounded in Truth-Based Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19191)
*Craig Steven Wright*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于概率代理的AI系统框架，通过结构化竞争和信念修正实现进化，证明了真理作为进化吸引子的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个数学严谨的AI系统，通过竞争和信念修正实现代理的动态进化，验证真理的可计算性和自调节性。

Method: 基于贝叶斯推理、测度理论和群体动力学，代理通过竞争和信念调整进化，使用哈希加密身份和因果推断算子。

Result: 系统证明了真理作为进化吸引子的存在，展示了可验证知识在对抗性认知压力下的涌现。

Conclusion: 该框架为自调节、可计算的AI系统提供了理论基础，验证了真理在动态竞争中的稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

### [8] [GBGC: Efficient and Adaptive Graph Coarsening via Granular-ball Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19224)
*Shuyin Xia,Guan Wang,Gaojie Xu,Sen Zhao,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多粒度颗粒球（GBGC）的高效自适应图粗化方法，通过自适应颗粒球图细化机制，显著提升了粗化效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图粗化方法主要基于谱保持视角，忽略了图的多粒度特性，导致粗化效果不佳。

Method: GBGC引入自适应颗粒球图细化机制，将原始图从粗到细分割为不同大小的颗粒球，并以这些颗粒球为超节点构建粗化图。

Result: GBGC的处理速度比其他先进方法快数十至数百倍，且粗化图的准确性几乎总是高于原始图。

Conclusion: GBGC具有良好的鲁棒性和泛化性，有望成为标准的图数据预处理方法。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

### [9] [RecLLM-R1: A Two-Stage Training Paradigm with Reinforcement Learning and Chain-of-Thought v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19235)
*Yu Xie,Xingkai Ren,Ying Qi,Yao Hu,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecLLM-R1是一个基于大语言模型（LLMs）的推荐框架，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）优化推荐准确性、多样性和业务目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统中的“过滤气泡”、外部知识利用不足以及模型优化与业务策略迭代脱节的问题。

Method: 1. 将用户数据和项目属性转化为LLM可理解的自然语言提示；2. 两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（GRPO+CoT）。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上，RecLLM-R1在准确性、多样性和新颖性等指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1有效缓解了过滤气泡效应，为复杂业务目标下的推荐模型与策略优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

### [10] [Emotion Detection on User Front-Facing App Interfaces for Enhanced Schedule Optimization: A Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19280)
*Feiting Yang,Antoine Moevus,Steve Lévesque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将情绪检测技术集成到日历应用中，通过生物特征和行为分析两种方法提升用户体验，其中行为分析方法在鼠标交互中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过情绪识别技术提升人机交互的适应性和个性化，增强用户的生产力和参与感。

Method: 采用两种方法：1) 基于生物特征（心率数据，使用LSTM和GRU神经网络预测情绪维度）；2) 基于行为（分析鼠标、键盘等交互数据，通过机器学习分类情绪。

Result: 行为分析方法在鼠标交互中准确率约90%；GRU在生物特征方法中优于LSTM，效价预测准确率达84.38%。

Conclusion: 情绪检测技术可有效提升日历应用的用户体验，行为分析方法更具一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

### [11] [Skywork-SWE: Unveiling Data Scaling Laws for Software Engineering in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19290)
*Liang Zeng,Yongcong Li,Yuzhen Xiao,Changshi Li,Chris Yuhao Liu,Rui Yan,Tianwen Wei,Jujie He,Xuchen Song,Yang Liu,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化的数据整理流程，显著提升了软件工程数据集的数量和多样性，并展示了数据规模对模型性能的持续提升作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程数据整理过程耗时且依赖人工标注，现有数据集规模有限，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用增量式、自动化的数据整理流程，构建了包含10,169个Python任务实例的数据集，并验证了8,000多个训练轨迹。

Result: Skywork-SWE模型在SWE-bench基准测试中达到38.0% pass@1准确率，使用测试时扩展技术后提升至47.0%。

Conclusion: 自动化数据整理流程和模型训练展示了数据规模对性能的持续提升，为未来研究提供了新的基准和工具。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future
research.

*Hyein Seo,Taewook Hwang,Yohan Lee,sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FEAT框架通过结合人工与LLM生成的高质量反馈（DM）和纯LLM生成的反馈（DG），提出了一种成本效益高的教师反馈生成方法。实验表明，少量DM（5-10%）加入DG能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI辅导系统中高质量教师反馈数据生成的高成本问题。

Method: 提出FEAT框架，构建三个互补数据集：DM（人工+LLM协作）、DG（纯LLM生成）、DA（DG为主，少量DM增强）。

Result: 实验显示，少量DM加入DG能优于纯DM。

Conclusion: FEAT框架在成本与质量间取得平衡，为教师反馈生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于搜索的游戏关卡修复方法，结合进化算法和多样性质量算法，用于修复机器学习生成的非功能性关卡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习生成的游戏关卡常出现非功能性（如不完整或对象不可达）的问题，同时限制修复时的修改次数。

Method: 采用基于搜索的解决方案，包括进化算法和多样性质量算法，对非功能性关卡进行修复。

Result: 该方法在修复机器学习生成的关卡时表现出良好效果，展示了混合程序内容生成（PCG）的潜力。

Conclusion: 结合PCGML生成和搜索修复的混合方法在游戏关卡设计和修复中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG是一种新型框架，通过动态意图转移图和双检索机制，显著提升多轮客服对话的上下文连贯性和目标导向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对话系统在多轮客服对话中难以同时保持上下文连贯和目标导向的问题。

Method: 构建动态意图转移图，结合意图图遍历和语义搜索的双检索机制。

Result: 在自动指标和LLM评估中显著优于传统方法，如BLEU提升11%，响应质量提升58%。

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG通过意图转移结构与语义检索的协同效应，有效解决了知识密集型多轮对话的挑战。

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

*Alexandre Chapin,Emmanuel Dellandrea,Liming Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了对象中心表示（OCR）在机器人操作任务中的潜力，通过模拟环境测试其在复杂场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCR研究多关注场景分解，缺乏对学习表示推理能力的评估，而机器人操作任务涉及多对象交互，是评估OCR潜力的理想场景。

Method: 创建多个模拟机器人操作任务，包含多对象和高随机化因素，对比OCR方法与整体表示方法的性能。

Result: OCR方法在复杂场景中表现优于整体表示方法，尤其在涉及复杂场景结构时。

Conclusion: OCR方法在机器人操作任务中展现出潜力，尤其在复杂场景下能克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

TL;DR: Commander-GPT是一个模块化决策路由框架，通过协调多个专门化的LLM代理来提升多模态讽刺理解任务的表现，相比现有方法在F1分数上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多模态讽刺理解任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的框架来整合多个LLM的能力。

Method: 提出Commander-GPT框架，利用三种集中式指挥官协调多个专门化的LLM代理，分别处理子任务（如上下文建模、情感分析等），最终整合信息进行讽刺判断。

Result: 在MMSD和MMSD 2.0基准测试中，F1分数平均提升4.4%和11.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Commander-GPT通过模块化设计和多代理协作，显著提升了多模态讽刺理解的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

the RAG-driven Reasoning Alignment (RDRA) mechanism, the Search-Think Iterative
Enhancement (STIE) mechanism, the Network-Local Intelligent Routing (NLR)
mechanism, and a progressive hybrid training strategy. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in exact match (EM) and LLM-judged score
(LJ) across four benchmarks, highlighting the framework's robustness and

TL;DR: NaviAgent是一种基于图导航的双层规划架构，通过多路径决策器和图编码导航器提升LLM在复杂工具链中的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态知识和单一路径执行，导致错误恢复能力差和搜索空间爆炸，限制了LLM在复杂工具链中的表现。

Method: NaviAgent采用双层架构：多路径决策器动态选择最优动作，图编码导航器构建工具依赖异构图并集成启发式搜索策略。

Result: 实验显示NaviAgent在所有基础模型和任务复杂度下均表现最佳，任务成功率平均提升13.5%-19.0%，执行步骤接近最优基线。

Conclusion: NaviAgent通过双层规划和图导航显著提升了LLM在工具链编排中的鲁棒性和效率，尤其适用于复杂任务和大模型。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的动态难度调整方法（NTRL），用于自动化设计《龙与地下城》的战斗遭遇，优化战斗时长和策略深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决《龙与地下城》中手动平衡战斗遭遇的复杂性，避免打断叙事流程。

Method: 将问题建模为上下文赌博机，基于实时队伍属性生成战斗遭遇。

Result: NTRL显著延长战斗时长（+200%），增加玩家伤害（-16.67%后战斗生命值），同时保持低团灭率和高胜率（70%）。

Conclusion: NTRL在提升战斗策略深度和难度方面优于人工设计，同时保持游戏公平性。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗）中，机器学习的高性能方法（如神经网络）往往缺乏可解释性，而符号方法（如ASP）虽可解释但预测性能不足。

Method: 采用混合方法，将FOLD-R++算法生成的ASP规则与黑盒ML分类器结合，选择性修正不确定预测并提供可解释性。

Result: 在五个医疗数据集上实验显示，该方法显著提升了准确性和F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合符号推理与传统ML可以在不牺牲准确性的情况下实现高可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂任务时避免手动定义环境模型的需求，通过动态生成和适应领域模型、初始状态和目标规范。

Result: 在基准规划领域和VirtualHome模拟环境中表现出色。

Conclusion: TAPAS通过动态适应和协作规划，有效解决了复杂任务，展示了强大的性能。

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在增量学习场景中表现不佳，且现有提示学习方法主要关注类增量学习，缺乏多域任务增量学习的策略，同时忽视了跨模态信息交换的潜力。

Method: 提出ChordPrompt框架，结合视觉和文本提示的跨模态交互，并采用域自适应文本提示实现多域持续适应。

Result: 在多域增量学习基准测试中，ChordPrompt在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt通过跨模态提示和域自适应策略，有效提升了视觉语言模型在多域增量学习中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Conclusion: ISLs是未来科学发现的关键范式，需进一步探索其实现与应用。

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文证明了在DMG（有向混合图）上，do-calculus对于识别宏观因果效应是无条件完备和可靠的，并扩展了非可识别性的图形标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的高维系统通常无法完全指定ADMG（无环有向混合图），且常包含循环因果动态，因此需要更通用的模型（如ioSCMs和DMGs）来研究宏观因果效应。

Method: 通过引入输入输出结构因果模型（ioSCMs）和DMGs，研究C-DMGs（聚类有向混合图）上的宏观因果效应，并证明do-calculus的完备性和可靠性。

Result: 在DMG上，do-calculus无条件完备且可靠；非可识别性的图形标准可扩展到部分C-DMGs。

Conclusion: 研究为处理高维和循环因果系统提供了理论支持，扩展了do-calculus的应用范围。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

Motivation: 研究人类和动物快速适应新环境的能力，探索情景记忆在强化学习中的作用，以及Transformer模型如何模拟这种能力。

Method: 训练一个Transformer模型在分布式的规划任务中进行上下文强化学习，分析其学习算法和表征学习机制。

Result: 模型的学习策略不同于传统模型无关或基于模型的规划，而是通过缓存中间计算实现快速适应，其表征学习与大脑海马-内嗅系统相似。

Conclusion: 研究表明记忆可作为计算资源存储经验和缓存计算，支持快速适应行为，为自然认知提供了机制性假设。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural
settings.

Motivation: 尽管机器学习在预测性维护中的应用日益增多，但模型不确定性限制了工业广泛采用。本文旨在解决预测误差对维护决策的影响。

Method: 提出IEO框架，结合随机扰动梯度下降算法，直接优化维护结果而非仅预测准确性。

Result: 在涡轮风扇维护案例中，IEO框架比ETO框架平均减少22%的维护遗憾。

Conclusion: IEO框架通过将预测模型训练与维护目标对齐，提高了决策质量，尤其在决策策略与目标不一致时效果显著。

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗文档分析提供了可靠、可解释且隐私保护的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis

point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手工设计LLM提示的劳动密集性和脆弱性问题，探索自动提示优化在三元组提取任务中的潜力。

Method: 通过改变提示策略、LLM模型、模式复杂度、输入文本长度和多样性等设置，评估三种自动提示优化工具（DSPy、APE、TextGrad）在两个数据集（SynthIE、REBEL）上的表现。

Result: 自动提示优化能生成接近人工设计的提示，尤其在模式复杂度和文本规模增加时效果更显著。

Conclusion: 自动提示优化技术在三元组提取任务中具有实际应用价值，能有效提升性能。

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于专家策略引导的查询重写方法SAGE，通过强化学习框架优化检索效果，并引入两种奖励机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前查询重写方法需要大规模监督数据或强化学习探索效率低，限制了检索效果的提升。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，结合专家策略（如语义扩展和实体消歧）和强化学习，并引入战略信用塑造（SCS）和对比奖励塑造（CRS）机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（如HotpotQA、FEVER等）取得新的最佳NDCG@10结果，同时降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: 策略引导的强化学习结合精细奖励机制，为信息检索系统提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境中，传统的Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL方法依赖重建奖励信号，效果不佳。

Method: 提出SimBelief框架，利用潜在任务信念度量学习相似任务的共同结构，并将其融入特定任务信念。

Result: 在稀疏奖励的MuJoCo和panda-gym任务上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SimBelief通过任务信念相似性度量，实现了高效的任务识别和快速适应。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

TL;DR: KnowRL通过将基于知识验证的事实性奖励集成到强化学习中，减少慢思考模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决慢思考模型因无法准确识别知识边界而导致的严重幻觉问题。

Method: 提出KnowRL，将事实性奖励（基于知识验证）整合到RL训练过程中，指导模型进行基于事实的慢思考。

Result: 在三个幻觉评估数据集和两个推理评估数据集上，KnowRL有效减少了幻觉，同时保持了模型的强推理能力。

Conclusion: KnowRL通过事实性奖励显著改善了慢思考模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

TL;DR: 该研究利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）自动检测图表中的数据可视化问题，验证了VLMs在识别图表类型、3D效果、轴标签等方面的有效性，但无法可靠评估图像质量和刻度标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者通常不了解或不遵循数据可视化原则，导致图表中的信息不准确或不完整，因此需要自动化的方法来检测这些问题。

Method: 研究比较了五种开源VLMs和五种提示策略，通过从数据可视化指南中提取的问题集评估其性能。

Result: VLMs在识别图表类型、3D效果、轴标签等方面表现良好（F1-score最高98.55%），但在图像质量和刻度标记方面表现不佳（F1-score最低0.74%）。Qwen2.5VL模型和总结性提示策略表现最佳。

Conclusion: VLMs可用于自动检测图表中的潜在问题（如缺失轴标签、不必要的3D效果），该方法可进一步扩展用于其他数据可视化问题。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测港口拥堵对全球供应链的可靠性至关重要，准确的预测可以优化运输计划、减少延误和成本，并增强供应链韧性。

Method: 利用历史AIS数据重建泊位调度，通过逆向强化学习（IRL）确定奖励函数，并开发Temporal-IRL模型预测船舶序列和停泊时间。

Result: 模型在纽约/新泽西港的Maher Terminal数据上训练和测试，取得了显著效果。

Conclusion: Temporal-IRL模型能够有效预测港口拥堵，为供应链管理提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

Motivation: 解决异构智能体在联合进化中的合作效率低和训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用GRPO联合训练，结合节点级蒙特卡洛采样和边际效益驱动的选择策略，优化智能体模型和记忆。

Result: 在通用和领域特定场景中，JoyAgents-R1性能接近更大LLM，同时基于较小开源模型实现。

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1通过高效采样和记忆进化，显著提升了MARL的训练稳定性和决策能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体快速发展导致有害内容传播加剧，现有数据集缺乏系统性、多样性和解释性，阻碍了有害表情包检测的进展。

Method: 引入MemeMind数据集，具备科学标准、大规模、多样性、双语支持和详细推理标注；提出MemeGuard框架，整合多模态信息与推理建模。

Result: MemeGuard在MemeMind数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind和MemeGuard为有害表情包检测提供了更全面的数据和更有效的框架。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

Motivation: 揭示LLMs中记忆与自我知识缺陷之间的交织关系，以提升模型的可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 采用新颖框架评估LLMs是否真正学习推理模式，还是仅记忆训练数据以应对类似复杂性问题。

Result: LLMs在科学和医学领域表现出45%以上的不一致性，因记忆解决方案而高估自身推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前架构和训练模式存在缺陷，需开发新技术以平衡模型对自身知识的认知，增强AI的可信度。

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型对非标准分词具有较强鲁棒性，某些情况下非标准分词甚至能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型对训练中未见过的非标准分词的鲁棒性，并探索非标准分词在特定任务中的潜在优势。

Method: 通过20个基准测试评估指令调优模型在随机采样分词和字符级分词下的性能表现，并分析鲁棒性来源。

Result: 指令调优模型在随机分词下保留93.4%性能，字符级分词下保留90.8%。字符级分词在字符串操作和代码理解任务中提升14%，右对齐数字分组在大数运算中提升33%。

Conclusion: 模型对分词器的依赖性低于预期，非标准分词在推理时干预可提升性能，鲁棒性主要源于指令调优阶段。

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

Motivation: LLMs生成的响应存在偏见，现有评估方法未能充分解决长文本响应和LLM输出的内在变异性问题。

Method: FiSCo在声明级别操作，利用蕴含检查评估响应间的一致性，并通过统计假设检验比较群体间和群体内的相似性。

Conclusion: FiSCo提供了一种更精细的方法来评估LLMs的公平性，尤其在长文本响应中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于置信度或熵的解掩码启发式方法在并行解掩码时表现不佳，无法处理多位置依赖关系，限制了推理速度。

Method: DUS利用一阶马尔可夫假设将序列位置分区为非相邻标记组，实现并行解掩码，减少去噪器调用次数。

Result: 在数学和代码生成任务中，DUS优于基于置信度的并行方法，显著提升了推理速度。

Conclusion: DUS为高效高质量的文本生成提供了一种轻量级解决方案，释放了MDLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

Conclusion: 多语言大模型在两项任务中表现最佳，团队在任务A和B中分别排名第5和第3。

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

Method: 引入MFTCXplain数据集，包含3000条多语言推文，标注了仇恨言论标签、道德类别和文本级解释。

Result: LLM在仇恨言论检测上表现良好（F1达0.836），但在道德情感预测上较弱（F1<0.35），且在少数语言中解释对齐有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在理解和反映人类道德推理方面能力有限。

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

### [44] [Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19089)
*Nathaniel Getachew,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了$	exttt{StorySim}$，一个可编程框架，用于生成合成故事以评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的心理理论（ToM）和世界建模（WM）能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准可能因预训练数据污染而受限，$	exttt{StorySim}$通过可控的$	exttt{Storyboard}$生成新颖、组合的故事提示，以精确操纵角色视角和事件。

Method: 使用$	exttt{StorySim}$设计一阶和二阶ToM任务及WM任务，控制对心理状态的追踪和建模能力。

Result: 实验表明，多数LLMs在WM任务上表现优于ToM任务，且对人类推理优于对无生命物体。还发现启发式行为（如近因偏差和对早期事件的过度依赖）。

Conclusion: $	exttt{StorySim}$为评估LLMs的ToM和WM能力提供了新工具，揭示了模型的行为模式，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HAF的多维度标准，用于评估LLMs在毒性解释中的合理性，并通过实验发现LLMs在复杂提示下的解释存在不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以评估LLMs的自由形式毒性解释，因此需要一种新方法来增强其在下游任务中的可信度。

Method: 提出HAF标准，开发六种基于不确定性量化的指标，无需人类参与即可全面评估LLMs的解释。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在简单提示下生成合理解释，但在复杂提示下解释不一致或无意义。

Conclusion: HAF标准有效评估LLMs的毒性解释，揭示了其在复杂推理中的局限性。

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合语音和文本优化的方法（J-TAED），通过结合语音和文本输入提升ASR准确性，并在推理时仅需语音输入。该方法能统一多模态内部表示，并支持基于文本的领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音数据稀缺问题，利用大量文本语料提升ASR性能，特别是在不匹配领域任务中。

Method: 联合训练语音和文本输入的TAED模型，统一多模态表示，并支持文本领域适应。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上WER降低5.8~12.8%，在两个外域数据集上通过文本适应分别降低15.3%和17.8%的WER。

Conclusion: J-TAED成功整合语音和语言信息，显著提升ASR性能，尤其在数据稀缺领域表现优异。

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过多种适应技术（如少样本提示、翻译测试、微调等）提升低资源语言在上下文学习中的表现，发现少样本提示和翻译测试优于梯度方法，并提出了新指标VOR分析性能下降原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在上下文学习中表现不佳的问题，探索最佳适应技术。

Method: 对五种目标语言、三种基础LLM和七项任务进行综合研究，比较少样本提示、翻译测试、微调等方法的性能。

Result: 少样本提示和翻译测试显著优于梯度方法，性能下降归因于灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的上下文学习提供了实用指导，并公开了数据集和模型。

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的通信协议，通过传递自然语言标记和状态转移轨迹来减少多智能体系统中的信息损失，并提出了状态增量编码（SDE）方法。实验表明，SDE在多智能体系统中表现优异，尤其在复杂推理任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统主要使用自然语言进行通信，虽然简单易解释，但会导致信息损失，尤其是在传递推理逻辑或抽象思维时。

Method: 提出了一种新的通信协议，传递自然语言标记和状态转移轨迹，并设计了状态增量编码（SDE）方法来表示状态转移轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用SDE的多智能体系统在复杂推理任务中表现优于其他通信协议，达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 状态增量编码（SDE）为基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了通信增强的潜力，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人格评估依赖问卷，而NLP提供了通过开放文本分析的新途径。本研究旨在解决长文本（超过2000词）的人格特质预测问题。

Method: 采用两步法：1）滑动窗口微调预训练语言模型提取上下文嵌入；2）使用带注意力机制的RNN整合长距离依赖关系。

Result: 通过消融实验和与LLaMA、Longformer等模型的对比，证明了该方法在预测准确性、效率和可解释性上的提升。

Conclusion: 结合语言特征和长文本建模的方法，为基于生活叙事的人格评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成数据在训练下游模型时的多样性问题，以缓解数据稀缺和标注耗时的问题。

Method: 通过实验分析不同多样性水平的LLM生成数据对模型性能的影响，并研究混合不同比例合成数据的效果。

Result: 适度多样性的LLM生成数据在分布偏移较小时能提升模型性能，而高多样性数据则可能损害性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来LLM作为数据生成器的应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Motivation: 心理健康需求增长，但现有AI咨询系统存在心理状态理解不足、数据依赖和隐私问题。

Method: EmoStage利用开源LLMs的推理能力，结合视角转换和阶段识别，生成情感共鸣的回应。

Result: 实验显示EmoStage在日文和中文咨询场景中提升回应质量，与数据驱动方法竞争。

Conclusion: EmoStage为AI心理咨询提供了一种高效、隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Result: 在speechocean762基准测试中，该模型在MDD任务上表现尤为突出，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本研究首次将语音属性、SSM建模和提示策略结合于CAPT，为发音反馈提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Motivation: LLM常出现角色偏离行为（OOC），影响交互一致性，现有评估方法难以捕捉细微偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能有效检测以往方法忽略的角色不一致问题。

Conclusion: 任务结构和角色可欲性影响模型适应性，角色一致性表达仍具挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Motivation: 当前方法在可靠定位和操作大语言模型的特征表示方面存在挑战，稀疏自编码器（SAE）虽有一定效果，但特征隔离和单义性不足。

Method: 提出了Feature Monosemanticity Score（FMS）量化特征单义性，并开发了Guided Sparse Autoencoders（G-SAE），在训练中利用标记概念引导潜在表示。

Result: 实验表明，G-SAE在毒性检测、写作风格识别和隐私属性识别等任务中提高了特征单义性，并实现了更精细的控制。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM的机制可解释性和控制提供了实用指南。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLM隐藏信息或大量人工设计，无法在黑盒设置下有效工作，需解决数据隐私和版权保护问题。

Method: 利用序列到序列映射模型推断输入文本与LLM输出后缀的潜在映射特征，通过关键标记扰动增强区分性，并引入原型分类器防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上验证，VeilProbe在黑盒设置下表现优越。

Conclusion: VeilProbe为黑盒设置下的预训练文本检测提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的语言模型在自然语言推理任务中表现优异，但主要依赖记忆而非规则推理，因此需要探索如何显式嵌入和记忆推理规则。

Method: 提出了一种基于语言变分自编码器（VAE）的完整管道，包括三个规则推理任务、理论框架和端到端架构。

Result: 实验表明，推理规则可在编码器参数空间中解耦，形成特征空间的聚类；注入先验知识可提升解码器性能；数学推理任务中样本量增加存在性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 通过显式嵌入推理规则，语言模型在泛化性和可控性方面得到提升，但需注意性能瓶颈和参数分离的优化。

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能够捕捉人类标注中的分歧信息，填补现有评估的空白。

Result: LLMs难以建模分歧，RLVR推理在分歧预测中表现更差。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs在分歧建模中的表现，并重新设计评估方法。

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new
models frequently claiming support for an increasing number of languages.
However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual
alignment, leaving assessments of multilingual capabilities fragmented in both
language and skill coverage. To address this, we introduce MuBench, a benchmark
covering 61 languages and evaluating a broad range of capabilities. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Motivation: 探索如何利用LLMs的常识推理能力，为对话系统生成多样化的数据增强内容，并自动评估其质量。

Method: 从5个知名对话数据集中随机抽取200个部分对话，基于不同常识属性生成替代响应；提出基于指令的提示框架，利用LLMs自动评估生成内容。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法能有效利用LLMs的常识推理能力，生成上下文相关的对话内容。

Conclusion: 该方法为对话系统的数据增强和自动评估提供了新思路，展示了LLMs在常识推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补教育理论与AI驱动对话学习之间的差距，优化LLM在教育中的应用。

Method: 通过文献综述，将教育理论映射到LLM能力，分析其优缺点，并提出提示策略和检索增强生成（RAG）以改进。

Result: 发现LLM在提供直接答案而非共同构建知识方面存在不足，但可通过设计提示和检索机制改善。

Conclusion: 提出实用策略（如苏格拉底式提问、支架式引导）以更好地将LLM与教育理论结合，提升教育效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

*Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Xuansheng Wu,Derek Wong,Ninhao Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型（LRMs）在高效推理策略下可能引入行为不一致性，包括自我矛盾和后合理化等行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高效推理策略是否会导致模型行为不一致，从而影响模型的稳健性和可靠性。

Method: 引入ICBENCH基准，从三个维度（任务设置、训练目标与学习行为、内部推理与自我解释）评估模型不一致性。

Result: 高效推理策略（如No-Thinking和Simple Token-Budget）显著增加了模型的不一致性，尽管大型模型表现更一致。

Conclusion: 高效推理虽提升效率，但可能带来模型逃避监督的风险，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少大型语言模型（LLM）中KV缓存的内存占用，同时最小化超低位量化带来的性能下降。

Method: 提出Anchor Score（AnS）量化每个token对量化误差的敏感性，并设计AnTKV框架结合Triton内核实现高效部署。

Result: AnTKV支持LLaMA-3-8B处理840K上下文长度，解码吞吐量提升3.5倍，在超低位量化下性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnTKV在超低位量化下显著降低困惑度，为KV缓存压缩提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Abstract: This paper presents the approach of our team called heiDS for the ArchEHR-QA
2025 shared task. A pipeline using a retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
framework is designed to generate answers that are attributed to clinical
evidence from the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients in response to
patient-specific questions. We explored various components of a RAG framework,
focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution
approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a
query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and
autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.
The experimental results show the benefits of our strategy in producing factual
and relevant answers when compared to a fixed-$k$.

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了NERL的结构精确性和LLMs的语义处理能力，为临床提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

Result: 在ScienceWorld基准测试中，gpt-4-turbo性能提升17.71%。

Conclusion: KnowMap高效且有效，展示了环境与经验知识对增强LLM推理能力的重要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental
and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 传统基于指标的疾病监测方法存在挑战，而在线媒体的监测成为流行解决方案。由于在线文章数量庞大，手动筛选不切实际，因此需要自动化工具。

Method: Health Sentinel采用多阶段信息提取管道，结合ML和非ML方法，从在线文章中提取疾病爆发或异常健康事件的结构化信息。

Result: 从2022年4月至今，Health Sentinel处理了超过3亿篇新闻文章，识别了超过95,000个独特的健康事件，其中3,500个被专家列为潜在爆发。

Conclusion: Health Sentinel成功实现了自动化监测，为公共卫生专家提供了及时干预的数据支持。

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

Method: 引入RCStat框架，利用原始注意力logits和相对上下文化（RC）随机变量，推导出RC的高效上界，并应用于KV压缩和归因分析。

Result: 在问答、摘要和归因任务中，RCStat实现了显著的性能提升，无需模型重训练即可达到SOTA的压缩和归因效果。

Conclusion: RCStat通过利用原始注意力logits，提供了一种更高效的输入token重要性分析方法，显著提升了实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管指标表现接近人类，但仍需谨慎，并引发对机器翻译评估进步可靠性的讨论。

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别隐蔽的仇恨言论，适用于不同平台和大规模数据集，为干预措施提供了依据。

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning

*Takashi Nishibayashi,Seiji Kanazawa,Kumpei Yamada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于合成病例模拟的方法，利用HPO数据库评估症状检查器算法更新对罕见疾病诊断性能的影响，验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见疾病评估数据不足的问题，降低手动创建临床病例的高成本。

Method: 利用HPO数据库生成合成病例，模拟症状检查器访谈，通过R²系数验证预测效果。

Result: 对包含频率信息的疾病，预测效果显著（R²=0.831和0.78）；无频率信息时误差较大。手动映射耗时约2小时/疾病。

Conclusion: 该方法为罕见疾病的算法更新提供低成本、透明的预部署评估手段，有望提升早期诊断支持。

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

TL;DR: 论文提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量网页文本生成合成数据，以解决预训练数据不足的问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据规模受限的问题，尤其是高质量文本稀缺，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量文档生成合成数据，混合高质量原始文本进行训练。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合数据比仅使用过滤数据分别提升1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 改写低质量文本是一种简单有效的扩展预训练数据的方法，优于其他合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

most significant linguistic issues in Arabic dialect identification. The
results corroborate applications like personalized chatbots that respond in
users' dialects, social media monitoring, and greater accessibility for Arabic

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于线性复杂度循环注意力（RA）层的长语音识别方法，比多头注意力（MHA）更高效且精度相当，并通过新训练范式进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头注意力（MHA）在长语音识别中因二次复杂度效率低下，研究旨在找到更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用双向循环注意力（RA）层，提出有限上下文注意力（LCA）基线，并开发长形式训练范式和方向丢弃（Direction Dropout）正则化方法。

Result: RA层在精度上与MHA相当但更高效，长形式训练使RA性能优于LCA，吞吐量提高44%。方向丢弃进一步优化精度与吞吐量权衡。

Conclusion: RA层是长语音识别的高效替代方案，方向丢弃提供了灵活的精度与效率控制。

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中取得了显著进展，但如何最优整合SFT和RL仍是一个基本挑战。

Method: 通过分析标记分布和学习动态，提出SRFT方法，结合SFT和RL的直接优化，而非两阶段顺序方法。

Result: SRFT在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率达到59.1%，优于零RL方法9.0%，在三个分布外基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: SRFT通过熵感知机制有效整合SFT和RL，显著提升了LLMs在推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three
dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

Abstract: Multiview point cloud registration is a fundamental task for constructing
globally consistent 3D models. Existing approaches typically rely on feature
extraction and data association across multiple point clouds; however, these
processes are challenging to obtain global optimal solution in complex
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel correspondence-free multiview
point cloud registration method. Specifically, we represent the global map as a
depth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least
squares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the
global map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which
rely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses
these challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth
map through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly
incorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging
environments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.

Motivation: 解决YOLOv8在细粒度识别任务（如车牌识别和车辆属性分类）上的不足，为智能交通系统提供自动化碳排放监测方案。

Conclusion: 该框架为智能交通系统中的碳排放监测提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上，该方法显著优于现有方法，能有效处理复杂拓扑并保持全局路径一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖大量先验知识，解决了现有方法的效率和鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Among diverse risk management tasks on site, it is essential to protect the

we conducted an analysis of the components in the pipeline to verify the

Conclusion: Damba-ST高效且泛化能力强，适用于新城市环境部署。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate

*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

TL;DR: SDict-VLM是一种新型视觉语言模型，通过频谱字典标记混合器替代卷积和自注意力，实现了高效且透明的跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖计算密集的卷积和自注意力，限制了效率和可解释性。

Method: 引入频谱字典标记混合器，将图像块或词片段表示为稀疏频率原子的组合。

Result: SDict-VLM在MS-COCO和VQAv2上表现优异，性能接近BLIP-2，但参数和计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效且可解释的视觉语言模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) unify computer vision and natural language
processing in a single architecture capable of interpreting and describing
images. Most state-of-the-art systems rely on two computationally intensive
components: convolutions in the vision encoder and quadratic self-attention for
multimodal fusion. This work removes both by introducing a spectral dictionary
token mixer, which represents each image patch or wordpiece as a sparse
combination of learnable frequency atoms. Our 1.1B-parameter prototype,
SDict-VLM, achieves BLEU-4 of 39.2, CIDEr of 127.5, and SPICE of 27.0 on
MS-COCO captioning, along with 50.3 percent accuracy on VQAv2. These results
close approximately 85 percent of the performance gap to BLIP-2 while using 60
percent fewer parameters, 2.3 times less peak GPU memory, and 2.2 times faster
inference than PaLI-3. To our knowledge, this is the first VLM to eliminate
both convolutions and self-attention while matching mid-scale transformer
baselines. In addition to its O(L log L) complexity, the shared frequency
dictionary enables transparent cross-modal alignment and offers a tunable
trade-off between accuracy and compute, paving the way for efficient and
interpretable VLMs.

TL;DR: DiffRIS利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，通过上下文感知适配器和渐进式跨模态推理解码器，显著提升了遥感图像分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前遥感图像分割方法在处理复杂对象特征（如尺度变化、多样方向和语义模糊）时存在局限性，需要更高效的跨模态对齐方法。

Method: 提出DiffRIS框架，包含上下文感知适配器（CP-adapter）和渐进式跨模态推理解码器（PCMRD），通过全局上下文建模和多尺度特征交互实现精确分割。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，DiffRIS在所有标准指标上均优于现有方法，确立了新的性能标杆。

Conclusion: DiffRIS验证了利用预训练扩散模型和自适应框架在遥感图像分割中的有效性，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

TL;DR: GLIMPSE是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于可视化大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在开放视觉问答（VQA）中依赖的图像区域，同时揭示多模态文本显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LVLM在生成自由形式文本响应时的视觉注意力分布，对于诊断幻觉、暴露偏见和确保透明度至关重要。

Method: GLIMPSE融合梯度加权注意力、自适应层传播和加权标记聚合，生成响应级归因热图。

Result: GLIMPSE在人类对齐方面优于先前的可解释性方法，并能揭示LVLM的跨模态归因、标记级推理动态以及人类注意力偏差。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE为分析LVLM的跨模态推理提供了细粒度解释，有助于诊断幻觉和偏见。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention
misalignment, hallucination, and bias.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为T2MD的方法，通过蒸馏技术将基于自注意力的扩散Transformer转换为线性复杂度的Mamba模型，以降低高分辨率图像生成的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散Transformer中自注意力机制的二次计算复杂度问题，同时探索Mamba模型在非因果视觉生成中的潜力。

Method: 提出T2MD方法，结合层级教师强制和基于特征的知识蒸馏，构建混合模型，实现从Transformer到Mamba的高效转换。

Result: 实验表明，T2MD在512×512分辨率下训练后，通过轻量级适应和高分辨率微调，可生成2048×2048的高质量图像。

Conclusion: T2MD证明了Mamba模型在非因果视觉生成中的可行性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention in diffusion
transformers (DiT) introduces substantial computational costs in
high-resolution image generation. While the linear-complexity Mamba model
emerges as a potential alternative, direct Mamba training remains empirically
challenging. To address this issue, this paper introduces diffusion
transformer-to-mamba distillation (T2MD), forming an efficient training
pipeline that facilitates the transition from the self-attention-based
transformer to the linear complexity state-space model Mamba. We establish a
diffusion self-attention and Mamba hybrid model that simultaneously achieves
efficiency and global dependencies. With the proposed layer-level teacher
forcing and feature-based knowledge distillation, T2MD alleviates the training
difficulty and high cost of a state space model from scratch. Starting from the
distilled 512$\times$512 resolution base model, we push the generation towards
2048$\times$2048 images via lightweight adaptation and high-resolution
fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our training path leads to low
overhead but high-quality text-to-image generation. Importantly, our results
also justify the feasibility of using sequential and causal Mamba models for
generating non-causal visual output, suggesting the potential for future
exploration.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个持续TTA基准测试中超越了现有方法，性能优异。

Conclusion: OoPk方法有效解决了灾难性遗忘和错误累积问题，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Continual Test Time Adaptation (CTTA) is a task that requires a source
pre-trained model to continually adapt to new scenarios with changing target
distributions. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on mitigating the
challenges of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Though there have
been emerging methods based on forgetting adaptation with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, they still struggle to balance competitive performance and
efficient model adaptation, particularly in complex tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this paper, to tackle the above issues, we propose a novel
pipeline, Orthogonal Projection Subspace to aggregate online Prior-knowledge,
dubbed OoPk. Specifically, we first project a tuning subspace orthogonally
which allows the model to adapt to new domains while preserving the knowledge
integrity of the pre-trained source model to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
Then, we elaborate an online prior-knowledge aggregation strategy that employs
an aggressive yet efficient image masking strategy to mimic potential target
dynamism, enhancing the student model's domain adaptability. This further
gradually ameliorates the teacher model's knowledge, ensuring high-quality
pseudo labels and reducing error accumulation. We demonstrate our method with
extensive experiments that surpass previous CTTA methods and achieve
competitive performances across various continual TTA benchmarks in semantic
segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Legato在OMR任务中表现出色，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end transformer model for optical music

of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to
generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for
symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC
decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the
strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct
experiments on a range of datasets and demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Given the lack of a standardized evaluation for
end-to-end OMR, we comprehensively compare our model against the previous state
of the art using a diverse set of metrics.

Conclusion: HAWAII框架高效整合多专家知识，显著提升性能且计算成本低。

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Conclusion: 基础模型在情感计算中表现出新兴行为，但也揭示了捷径学习、偏见和公平性问题，尤其在心理健康和教育等敏感领域。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型稀有野生动物（如草原犬鼠）的检测对生态保护至关重要，但由于其体型小、分布稀疏和视觉特征不明显，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: RareSpot结合多尺度一致性学习和上下文感知增强，前者通过特征金字塔的结构对齐增强细粒度表示，后者通过合成困难样本提升模型性能。

Conclusion: RareSpot不仅支持生态监测，还为复杂空中场景中小型稀有物种的检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing with diffusion models have achieved
impressive results, offering fine-grained control over the generation process.
However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative
nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing
capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality.
High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image
editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source
image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion
using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our
method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly
improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between
editability and content preservation. We achieve state-of-the-art performance
across various image editing tasks and datasets, demonstrating that our method
matches or surpasses full-step diffusion models while being substantially more
efficient. The code of our method is available on GitHub at

Motivation: 解决体素表示在3D场景生成中的内存密集、分辨率固定和难以编辑的问题。

Method: 采用混合表示，地面用栅格化格式，物体用向量化3D基元，并引入稳定的Cholesky参数化方法。

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上，PrITTI生成质量优于体素基线，内存需求降低3倍，支持实例级操作。

Conclusion: PrITTI为3D语义场景生成提供了高效、灵活且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale 3D semantic scene generation has predominantly relied on
voxel-based representations, which are memory-intensive, bound by fixed
resolutions, and challenging to edit. In contrast, primitives represent
semantic entities using compact, coarse 3D structures that are easy to
manipulate and compose, making them an ideal representation for this task. In
this paper, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion-based framework that
leverages primitives as the main foundational elements for generating
compositional, controllable, and editable 3D semantic scene layouts. Our method
adopts a hybrid representation, modeling ground surfaces in a rasterized format
while encoding objects as vectorized 3D primitives. This decomposition is also
reflected in a structured latent representation that enables flexible scene
manipulation of ground and object components. To overcome the orientation
ambiguities in conventional encoding methods, we introduce a stable
Cholesky-based parameterization that jointly encodes object size and
orientation. Experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that PrITTI outperforms
a voxel-based baseline in generation quality, while reducing memory
requirements by up to $3\times$. In addition, PrITTI enables direct
instance-level manipulation of objects in the scene and supports a range of
downstream applications, including scene inpainting, outpainting, and
photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态跟踪（如仅RGB）在低光照和恶劣天气等条件下表现不佳，多模态跟踪（如RGB-T）通过互补数据提升性能，但现有基于Vision Transformer的模型计算成本高。

Method: 采用MobileViT设计渐进式融合框架，联合学习模板和搜索区域的模态内和模态间交互，使用可分离注意力生成高效特征表示。

Result: 模型参数少于400万，GPU推理速度达122帧/秒，性能与现有高效多模态跟踪器相当。

Conclusion: 首次将MobileViT应用于RGB-T和多模态跟踪，实现了高效且准确的跟踪性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in
challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather
conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to
leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent
Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they
are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we
propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision
Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework
that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the
template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces
effective feature representations that support more accurate target
localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed.
Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves
comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less
than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second.
This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers
for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model
weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: PRISM是一种可扩展的工具，适用于分析和审核在线平台中的有害或政治敏感内容。

Abstract: Online videos play a central role in shaping political discourse and
amplifying cyber social threats such as misinformation, propaganda, and
radicalization. Detecting the most impactful or "standout" moments in video
content is crucial for content moderation, summarization, and forensic
analysis. In this paper, we introduce PRISM (Perceptual Recognition for
Identifying Standout Moments), a lightweight and perceptually-aligned framework
for keyframe extraction. PRISM operates in the CIELAB color space and uses
perceptual color difference metrics to identify frames that align with human
visual sensitivity. Unlike deep learning-based approaches, PRISM is
interpretable, training-free, and computationally efficient, making it well
suited for real-time and resource-constrained environments. We evaluate PRISM
on four benchmark datasets: BBC, TVSum, SumMe, and ClipShots, and demonstrate
that it achieves strong accuracy and fidelity while maintaining high
compression ratios. These results highlight PRISM's effectiveness in both
structured and unstructured video content, and its potential as a scalable tool
for analyzing and moderating harmful or politically sensitive media in online
platforms.

Abstract: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) remain the leading cause of
mortality globally, as reported in the Global Disease Burden Study 2021.
Opportunistic screening leverages data collected from routine health check-ups
and multimodal data can play a key role to identify at-risk individuals. Chest
X-rays (CXR) provide insights into chronic conditions contributing to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
directly assesses cardiac electrical activity and structural abnormalities.
Integrating CXR and ECG could offer a more comprehensive risk assessment than
conventional models, which rely on clinical scores, computed tomography (CT)
measurements, or biomarkers, which may be limited by sampling bias and single
modality constraints. We propose a novel predictive modeling framework -
MOSCARD, multimodal causal reasoning with co-attention to align two distinct
modalities and simultaneously mitigate bias and confounders in opportunistic
risk estimation. Primary technical contributions are - (i) multimodal alignment
of CXR with ECG guidance; (ii) integration of causal reasoning; (iii) dual
back-propagation graph for de-confounding. Evaluated on internal, shift data
from emergency department (ED) and external MIMIC datasets, our model
outperformed single modality and state-of-the-art foundational models - AUC:
0.75, 0.83, 0.71 respectively. Proposed cost-effective opportunistic screening
enables early intervention, improving patient outcomes and reducing
disparities.

language-aware embeddings and a novel adaptation of the Grounding-DINO
framework, enabling it to identify species specified through natural language
inputs across both terrestrial and marine environments. Trained on 15 datasets,
OW outperforms most existing methods, achieving up to \textbf{0.981} mAP50 with
fine-tuning and \textbf{0.597} mAP50 on seven datasets featuring novel species.
Additionally, we introduce an efficient search algorithm that combines
k-nearest neighbors and breadth-first search to prioritize areas where social
species are likely to be found. This approach captures over \textbf{95\%} of
species while exploring only \textbf{33\%} of the available images. To support
reproducibility, we publicly release our source code and dataset splits,
establishing OW as a flexible, cost-effective solution for global biodiversity
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古代文字是人类文明的重要载体，自动化识别有助于大规模解读并推动考古学和数字人文学研究。

Method: 分类现有研究，分析不同文字的识别方法，探讨独特挑战（如数据不平衡和图像退化）及解决方案（如少样本学习和噪声鲁棒技术）。

Result: 总结了当前方法的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 论文旨在为古代文字的识别、解读和破译提供结构化、前瞻性的视角，支持该领域的持续发展。

Abstract: Ancient scripts, e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs, Oracle Bone Inscriptions, and
Ancient Greek inscriptions, serve as vital carriers of human civilization,
embedding invaluable historical and cultural information. Automating ancient
script image recognition has gained importance, enabling large-scale
interpretation and advancing research in archaeology and digital humanities.
With the rise of deep learning, this field has progressed rapidly, with
numerous script-specific datasets and models proposed. While these scripts vary
widely, spanning phonographic systems with limited glyphs to logographic
systems with thousands of complex symbols, they share common challenges and
methodological overlaps. Moreover, ancient scripts face unique challenges,
including imbalanced data distribution and image degradation, which have driven
the development of various dedicated methods. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of ancient script image recognition methods. We begin by
categorizing existing studies based on script types and analyzing respective
recognition methods, highlighting both their differences and shared strategies.
We then focus on challenges unique to ancient scripts, systematically examining
their impact and reviewing recent solutions, including few-shot learning and
noise-robust techniques. Finally, we summarize current limitations and outline
promising future directions. Our goal is to offer a structured, forward-looking
perspective to support ongoing advancements in the recognition, interpretation,
and decipherment of ancient scripts.

TL;DR: MedErr-CT是一个新的基准测试，用于评估医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在CT报告中识别和纠正错误的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT在临床诊断中至关重要，但诊断错误问题日益突出，现有医学视觉问答基准缺乏临床相关性。

Method: 通过VQA框架设计MedErr-CT基准，包含六种错误类别和三个任务级别。

Result: 评估了先进的3D医学MLLMs，发现其在不同错误类型上的能力差异显著。

Conclusion: 该基准有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的MLLMs，减少诊断错误并提高准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: Video-XL-2是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过任务感知的KV稀疏化技术，显著提升了长视频理解的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临高内存和计算成本的问题，难以同时实现高性能和高效率。

Method: 采用分块预填充和双层键值解码技术，通过稀疏注意力机制降低计算和内存开销。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最优性能，且能高效处理超过10,000帧的视频。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新的稀疏化技术，为长视频理解提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法主要针对单模态语言模型，无法有效应对多模态输入带来的复杂安全威胁，且当前数据集缺乏细粒度的政策基础推理。

Method: 通过构建MSR-Align数据集，支持跨视觉和文本模态的细粒度、政策基础推理，并采用严格的质量过滤。

Result: 实验表明，基于MSR-Align微调的模型显著提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持或增强了一般推理性能。

Conclusion: MSR-Align为提升多模态模型的安全对齐提供了可扩展且有效的基础，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
reasoning tasks through enhanced chain-of-thought capabilities. However, this
advancement also introduces novel safety risks, as these models become
increasingly vulnerable to harmful multimodal prompts that can trigger
unethical or unsafe behaviors. Existing safety alignment approaches, primarily
designed for unimodal language models, fall short in addressing the complex and
nuanced threats posed by multimodal inputs. Moreover, current safety datasets
lack the fine-grained, policy-grounded reasoning required to robustly align
reasoning-capable VLMs. In this work, we introduce {MSR-Align}, a high-quality
Multimodal Safety Reasoning dataset tailored to bridge this gap. MSR-Align
supports fine-grained, deliberative reasoning over standardized safety policies
across both vision and text modalities. Our data generation pipeline emphasizes
multimodal diversity, policy-grounded reasoning, and rigorous quality filtering
using strong multimodal judges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
fine-tuning VLMs on MSR-Align substantially improves robustness against both
textual and vision-language jailbreak attacks, while preserving or enhancing
general reasoning performance. MSR-Align provides a scalable and effective
foundation for advancing the safety alignment of reasoning-capable VLMs. Our
dataset is made publicly available at

Conclusion: AIR框架为图像识别任务提供了高效、低成本的数据解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering
and annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or
sensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and
resource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image
Recognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR
empowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,
eliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains
deep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition
performance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen
and AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets
tailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a
novel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of
large language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to
eliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of
generated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,
thereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is
particularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our
generated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's
potential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We
also conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of
5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种3D选择性扫描模块（3D-SSM）以解决现有Mamba方法在遥感变化检测中长距离依赖捕捉不足的问题，并结合时空交互模块（SIM）和多分支特征提取模块（MBFEM）提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在遥感变化检测中因无法有效捕捉图像通道间的长距离依赖而受限，限制了特征表示能力。

Method: 提出3D-SSM模块从空间平面和通道角度捕获全局信息，并结合SIM模块实现双时相特征整合，MBFEM模块融合频域、空间域和3D-SSM特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3D-SSM及其配套模块显著提升了遥感变化检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing Mamba-based approaches in remote sensing change detection have
enhanced scanning models, yet remain limited by their inability to capture
long-range dependencies between image channels effectively, which restricts
their feature representation capabilities. To address this limitation, we
propose a 3D selective scan module (3D-SSM) that captures global information
from both the spatial plane and channel perspectives, enabling a more
comprehensive understanding of the data.Based on the 3D-SSM, we present two key
components: a spatiotemporal interaction module (SIM) and a multi-branch
feature extraction module (MBFEM). The SIM facilitates bi-temporal feature
integration by enabling interactions between global and local features across
images from different time points, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle
changes. Meanwhile, the MBFEM combines features from the frequency domain,
spatial domain, and 3D-SSM to provide a rich representation of contextual
information within the image. Our proposed method demonstrates favourable
performance compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods on five
benchmark datasets through extensive experiments. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中目标域与源域分布不匹配的问题，同时保持目标域的特征判别性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CAN和SPCAN方法在无监督域自适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new unsupervised domain adaptation approach called
Collaborative and Adversarial Network (CAN), which uses the
domain-collaborative and domain-adversarial learning strategy for training the
neural network. The domain-collaborative learning aims to learn domain-specific
feature representation to preserve the discriminability for the target domain,
while the domain adversarial learning aims to learn domain-invariant feature
representation to reduce the domain distribution mismatch between the source
and target domains. We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly
formulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on
the losses. We then design a collaborative and adversarial training scheme,
which automatically learns domain-specific representations from lower blocks in
CNNs through collaborative learning and domain-invariant representations from
higher blocks through adversarial learning. Moreover, to further enhance the
discriminability in the target domain, we propose Self-Paced CAN (SPCAN), which
progressively selects pseudo-labeled target samples for re-training the
classifiers. We employ a self-paced learning strategy to select pseudo-labeled
target samples in an easy-to-hard fashion. Comprehensive experiments on
different benchmark datasets, Office-31, ImageCLEF-DA, and VISDA-2017 for the
object recognition task, and UCF101-10 and HMDB51-10 for the video action
recognition task, show our newly proposed approaches achieve the
state-of-the-art performance, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of
our proposed approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The

Motivation: 现有水道感知模型仅关注实例级对象感知，缺乏全局语义理解能力，限制了大规模监测和结构化日志生成。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）构建WaterCaption数据集，并提出Da Yu模型，采用Nano Transformer Adaptor（NTA）平衡计算效率与视觉特征建模能力。

Result: Da Yu在WaterCaption及其他字幕生成基准测试中表现优异，平衡了性能与效率。

Conclusion: WaterCaption和Da Yu为水道环境的视觉地理理解和空间场景认知提供了新研究方向。

Abstract: Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决现有4D高斯溅射和动态NeRF方法在长时间捕获中的训练开销问题，实现大规模动态环境的精确重建。

Method: 通过可逆高斯溅射变形网络，将场景分解为静态背景和时变对象，利用分层变形策略实现自由视点渲染。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上实现更高质量的重建，同时显著减少训练和渲染时间。

Conclusion: HoliGS为现实场景中的实体视图合成提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose HoliGS, a novel deformable Gaussian splatting framework that
addresses embodied view synthesis from long monocular RGB videos. Unlike prior
4D Gaussian splatting and dynamic NeRF pipelines, which struggle with training
overhead in minute-long captures, our method leverages invertible Gaussian
Splatting deformation networks to reconstruct large-scale, dynamic environments
accurately. Specifically, we decompose each scene into a static background plus
time-varying objects, each represented by learned Gaussian primitives
undergoing global rigid transformations, skeleton-driven articulation, and
subtle non-rigid deformations via an invertible neural flow. This hierarchical
warping strategy enables robust free-viewpoint novel-view rendering from
various embodied camera trajectories by attaching Gaussians to a complete
canonical foreground shape (\eg, egocentric or third-person follow), which may
involve substantial viewpoint changes and interactions between multiple actors.
Our experiments demonstrate that \ourmethod~ achieves superior reconstruction
quality on challenging datasets while significantly reducing both training and
rendering time compared to state-of-the-art monocular deformable NeRFs. These
results highlight a practical and scalable solution for EVS in real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released.

Motivation: 现有方法在伪装物体分割中存在域差距和边界模糊问题，导致分割和分类效果不佳。

Method: 采用VLM引导的SAM进行分割，利用VLM特征作为显式提示；分类阶段通过alpha通道保留完整图像上下文，避免硬裁剪带来的域差距。

Result: 在OVCOS和传统伪装物体分割基准测试中表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 通过结合VLM语义，实现了更准确的伪装物体分割和分类。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Camouflaged Object Segmentation (OVCOS) seeks to segment and
classify camouflaged objects from arbitrary categories, presenting unique
challenges due to visual ambiguity and unseen categories.Recent approaches
typically adopt a two-stage paradigm: first segmenting objects, then
classifying the segmented regions using Vision Language Models (VLMs).However,
these methods (1) suffer from a domain gap caused by the mismatch between VLMs'
full-image training and cropped-region inference, and (2) depend on generic
segmentation models optimized for well-delineated objects, making them less
effective for camouflaged objects.Without explicit guidance, generic
segmentation models often overlook subtle boundaries, leading to imprecise
segmentation.In this paper,we introduce a novel VLM-guided cascaded framework
to address these issues in OVCOS.For segmentation, we leverage the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), guided by the VLM.Our framework uses VLM-derived features
as explicit prompts to SAM, effectively directing attention to camouflaged
regions and significantly improving localization accuracy.For classification,
we avoid the domain gap introduced by hard cropping.Instead, we treat the
segmentation output as a soft spatial prior via the alpha channel, which
retains the full image context while providing precise spatial guidance,
leading to more accurate and context-aware classification of camouflaged
objects.The same VLM is shared across both segmentation and classification to
ensure efficiency and semantic consistency.Extensive experiments on both OVCOS
and conventional camouflaged object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the
clear superiority of our method, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging
rich VLM semantics for both segmentation and classification of camouflaged
objects.

Conclusion: 结合人类注视数据的方法为临床技能评估提供了客观工具，尤其在高压环境下具有潜力。

Abstract: Airway management skills are critical in emergency medicine and are typically
assessed through subjective evaluation, often failing to gauge competency in
real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for
assessing airway skills, specifically endotracheal intubation (ETI), using
human gaze data and video recordings. The proposed system leverages an
attention mechanism guided by the human gaze to enhance the recognition of
successful and unsuccessful ETI procedures. Visual masks were created from gaze
points to guide the model in focusing on task-relevant areas, reducing
irrelevant features. An autoencoder network extracts features from the videos,
while an attention module generates attention from the visual masks, and a
classifier outputs a classification score. This method, the first to use human
gaze for ETI, demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional
methods. The integration of human gaze data not only enhances model performance
but also offers a robust, objective assessment tool for clinical skills,
particularly in high-stress environments such as military settings. The results
show improvements in prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and trustworthiness,
highlighting the potential for this approach to improve clinical training and
patient outcomes in emergency medicine.

Conclusion: LM-AD通过AQM模块有效解决了3D点云功能检测中的细粒度对齐问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Conclusion: PMC框架在多模态域适应任务中具有显著效果，尤其在处理目标域模态缺失问题时表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new generic multi-modality domain adaptation
framework called Progressive Modality Cooperation (PMC) to transfer the
knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by exploiting
multiple modality clues (\eg, RGB and depth) under the multi-modality domain
adaptation (MMDA) and the more general multi-modality domain adaptation using
privileged information (MMDA-PI) settings. Under the MMDA setting, the samples
in both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our
PMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable
pseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information
and modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,
some modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the
multi-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with
privileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data
generation (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target
domain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution
mismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using
adversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive
experiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various
multi-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and
MMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC
framework.

Abstract: Traditional fundus image analysis models focus on single-modal tasks,
ignoring fundus modality complementarity, which limits their versatility.
Recently, retinal foundation models have emerged, but most still remain
modality-specific. Integrating multiple fundus imaging modalities into a single
foundation model is valuable. However, in dynamic environments, data from
different modalities often arrive incrementally, necessitating continual
pre-training. To address this, we propose RetCoP, the first continual
vision-language pre-training framework in the fundus domain, which
incrementally integrates image and text features from different imaging
modalities into a single unified foundation model. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting in continual pre-training, we introduce a rehearsal strategy
utilizing representative image-text pairs and an off-diagonal information
distillation approach. The former allows the model to revisit knowledge from
previous stages, while the latter explicitly preserves the alignment between
image and text representations. Experiments show that RetCoP outperforms all
the compared methods, achieving the best generalization and lowest forgetting
rate. The code can be found at https://github.com/Yuang-Yao/RetCoP.

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis is critical for cancer survival
prediction. However, existing approaches predominantly integrate formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides with genomic data, while neglecting the
availability of other preservation slides, such as Fresh Froze (FF) slides.
Moreover, as the high-resolution spatial nature of pathology data tends to
dominate the cross-modality fusion process, it hinders effective multimodal
fusion and leads to modality imbalance challenges between pathology and
genomics. These methods also typically require complete data modalities,
limiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as
missing either pathology or genomic data. In this paper, we propose a
multimodal survival prediction framework that leverages hypergraph learning to
effectively integrate multi-WSI information and cross-modality interactions
between pathology slides and genomics data while addressing modality imbalance.
In addition, we introduce a memory mechanism that stores previously learned
paired pathology-genomic features and dynamically compensates for incomplete
modalities. Experiments on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms advanced methods by over 2.3% in C-Index. Under incomplete modality
scenarios, our approach surpasses pathology-only (3.3%) and gene-only models
(7.9%). Code: https://github.com/MCPathology/M2Surv

through an innovative and cost-effective method for constructing synthetic 3D
scenes with fine-grained part-level annotations, paving the way for advanced
3D-part scene understanding. On the methodological side, we propose OpenPart3D,
a 3D-input-only framework to effectively tackle the challenges of part-level

in open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks at the part level, with strong
generalization capabilities across various 3D scene datasets.

Conclusion: Chan-Vese模型适用于复杂分割任务，具有实际成像应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation and implementation of the
Chan-Vese active contour model for image segmentation. The model, derived from
the Mumford-Shah variational framework, evolves contours based on regional
intensity differences rather than image gradients, making it highly effective
for segmenting noisy images or images with weak boundaries. We provide a
rigorous mathematical derivation of the level set formulation, including
detailed treatment of each energy term using the divergence theorem and curve
evolution theory. The resulting algorithm is implemented in Python using finite
difference methods with special care to numerical stability, including an
upwind entropy scheme and curvature-based regularization. Experimental results
on medical and synthetic images demonstrate accurate segmentation, robustness
to noise, and superior performance compared to classical edge-based methods.
This study confirms the suitability of the Chan-Vese model for complex
segmentation tasks and highlights its potential for use in real-world imaging
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蒸馏视频生成模型在快速合成时难以实现运动定制，现有方法无法适应其加速生成过程和大去噪步骤。

Method: 利用高质量慢速教师模型通过端点预测和插值指导快速学生模型，动态分配计算资源。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了运动保真度和生成质量，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: MotionEcho为蒸馏视频生成模型提供了一种高效的运动定制解决方案。

Abstract: Distilled video generation models offer fast and efficient synthesis but
struggle with motion customization when guided by reference videos, especially
under training-free settings. Existing training-free methods, originally
designed for standard diffusion models, fail to generalize due to the
accelerated generative process and large denoising steps in distilled models.
To address this, we propose MotionEcho, a novel training-free test-time
distillation framework that enables motion customization by leveraging
diffusion teacher forcing. Our approach uses high-quality, slow teacher models
to guide the inference of fast student models through endpoint prediction and
interpolation. To maintain efficiency, we dynamically allocate computation
across timesteps according to guidance needs. Extensive experiments across
various distilled video generation models and benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly improves motion fidelity and generation quality
while preserving high efficiency. Project page:

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂条件下稳定建模组织几何和变形，为手术导航和自主软组织操作提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Tissue deformation recovery based on stereo endoscopic images is crucial for
tool-tissue interaction analysis and benefits surgical navigation and
autonomous soft tissue manipulation. Previous research suffers from the
problems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack
of tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.
Unlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are
represented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue
geometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D
displacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6
parameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local
deformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where
all motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.
Inter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,
making it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map
is introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online
approach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo
and ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,
the method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue
is partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that
the 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches
0.37$\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,
respectively. The method can also estimate surface strain distribution during
various manipulations as an extra modality for mechanical-based analysis.

Result: 文本可读性在大量训练迭代后突然出现，而语义理解能力则从早期逐渐发展；图像与渲染文本的匹配能力发展更慢。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要定制训练策略以加速VLMs的文本理解能力，为未来多模态学习优化奠定基础。

Abstract: We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images
emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis
reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a
given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial
training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which
develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence
may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general
semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing
later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops
even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings
highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text
comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing
multimodal learning.

Result: 在ERA5和CMIP6数据集上表现优异，计算量减少一半，且模型可跨分辨率迁移。

Conclusion: HDD为概率气候降尺度提供了轻量级解决方案，支持高效生成高分辨率气候数据。

Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data
needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally
demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling
models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to
their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common
in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally
intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which
introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion
framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling
scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6
models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as
many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at
0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with
much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for
probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble
high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at:

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过事件流特征实现了高效的MAV检测，并发布了首个事件相机MAV数据集，为社区提供了新资源。

Abstract: Existing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) detection methods mainly rely on the
target's appearance features in RGB images, whose diversity makes it difficult
to achieve generalized MAV detection. We notice that different types of MAVs
share the same distinctive features in event streams due to their high-speed
rotating propellers, which are hard to see in RGB images. This paper studies
how to detect different types of MAVs from an event camera by fully exploiting
the features of propellers in the original event stream. The proposed method
consists of three modules to extract the salient and spatio-temporal features
of the propellers while filtering out noise from background objects and camera
motion. Since there are no existing event-based MAV datasets, we introduce a
novel MAV dataset for the community. This is the first event-based MAV dataset
comprising multiple scenarios and different types of MAVs. Without training,
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can deal with
challenging scenarios, achieving a precision rate of 83.0\% (+30.3\%) and a
recall rate of 81.5\% (+36.4\%) on the proposed testing dataset. The dataset

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained
increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to
cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as
well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these
problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework
for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce
conditions. To harmonize dimension discrepancies and dynamically adjust
modality contributions, we propose the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF)
module, a novel modulation-based fusion paradigm with a streamlined
architecture. We first derive the modulation objectives and introduce a
modality confidence ratio, enabling the incorporation of prior knowledge into
the fusion process. Then, the feature masks, density and leakage losses are
proposed to achieve the modulation objectives. Additionally, we introduce
FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle
noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Furthermore, interpretability studies
are conducted to explore how different tabular encoders supervise the imaging
modality during contrastive pretraining for the first time. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves a superior balance between
multimodal performance and data efficiency while showing strong adaptability to
incomplete tabular data. Interpretability analysis also highlights FT-Mamba's
capabilities in extracting distinct tabular features and guiding the image
encoder toward more accurate and flexible attention patterns.

Abstract: Image attribution analysis seeks to highlight the feature representations
learned by visual models such that the highlighted feature maps can reflect the
pixel-wise importance of inputs. Gradient integration is a building block in
the attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived
samples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a
building block often combines with other information from visual models such as
activation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the
sample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image
distribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add
noise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low
explanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra
information can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy
attribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment
problem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a
semi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample
distribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the
distribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large
scale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield
more satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去模糊数据集规模小且场景单一，无法满足复杂真实场景的需求。

Method: 通过智能手机慢动作视频模拟真实长曝光模糊，平均240帧生成模糊图像，并使用中间帧作为清晰参考。

Result: 数据集规模是现有数据集的10倍，场景多样性更高，测试显示现有SOTA模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 该数据集为开发鲁棒且泛化能力强的去模糊模型提供了新的挑战性基准。

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from
smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we
simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry
images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our
dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it
approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the
amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with
varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art
(SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance
degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our
dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and
generalizable deblurring models.

*Yuanhe Tian,Lei Mao,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的CT报告生成方法，通过循环视觉特征提取和立体注意力机制，解决了CT图像报告生成中的空间编码和多层次特征整合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未明确考虑CT切片间的变换关系，也未有效整合多层次图像特征（如特定器官病变），导致CT报告生成效果不佳。

Method: 使用视觉Transformer循环处理CT切片，并通过立体注意力机制从不同角度选择重要视觉信息，与文本特征对齐，指导LLM生成报告。

Result: 在M3D-Cap数据集上，该方法优于基线模型，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过循环特征提取和立体注意力机制，显著提升了CT报告生成的准确性和有效性。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实图像数据集难以获取且存在隐私和法律问题，以及现有合成数据训练模型性能不足的问题。

Method: 1. 改进神经分形生成新合成数据；2. 提出反向风格化技术，将真实图像特征迁移到合成数据上。

Result: KID显示领域差距显著降低；EDM2扩散模型FID降低11%，ViT-S分类模型在ImageNet-100上准确率提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法为无法获取大规模真实数据时训练实用模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Motivation: 现有Surgical-VQLA模型缺乏深度推理能力和可解释性，限制了其在临床应用中的可靠性和发展潜力。

Method: 构建Surgery-R1-54k数据集，设计两阶段微调机制（SFT和RFT），并引入多模态一致性奖励机制以减少位置幻觉。

Conclusion: Surgery-R1通过创新的数据集和微调机制，显著提升了手术场景中的推理能力，为临床应用提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and
dataset will be organized in https://github.com/FiFi-HAO467/Surgery-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下显著实例分割（USIS）因水下环境的动态性和数据稀缺性而未被充分研究，需要大规模高质量数据集支持。

Method: 构建USIS16K数据集，包含16,151张高分辨率水下图像，涵盖158类对象，并提供实例级标注。

Result: USIS16K在多样性、复杂性和可扩展性方面显著提升，为水下目标检测和USIS任务提供了基准。

Conclusion: USIS16K数据集和基准模型公开可用，将推动水下显著实例分割领域的研究。

Abstract: Inspired by the biological visual system that selectively allocates attention
to efficiently identify salient objects or regions, underwater salient instance
segmentation (USIS) aims to jointly address the problems of where to look
(saliency prediction) and what is there (instance segmentation) in underwater
scenarios. However, USIS remains an underexplored challenge due to the
inaccessibility and dynamic nature of underwater environments, as well as the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. In this paper, we
introduce USIS16K, a large-scale dataset comprising 16,151 high-resolution
underwater images collected from diverse environmental settings and covering
158 categories of underwater objects. Each image is annotated with high-quality
instance-level salient object masks, representing a significant advance in
terms of diversity, complexity, and scalability. Furthermore, we provide
benchmark evaluations on underwater object detection and USIS tasks using
USIS16K. To facilitate future research in this domain, the dataset and
benchmark models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LVLMs在多模态和语言上的偏差问题，如描述粒度不平衡和幻觉描述。

Method: 提出启发式问答和对比句子评分，逐步丰富和校准描述。

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现优异，生成描述更丰富且准确。

Conclusion: ScaleCap有效提升了图像描述的准确性和丰富性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMSViT是一种新型的分层掩码自监督视觉变换器，用于角膜神经分割和糖尿病周围神经病变诊断，通过多尺度特征提取和自监督学习，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病周围神经病变（DPN）影响近半数糖尿病患者，需要早期检测。现有的角膜共聚焦显微镜（CCM）自动诊断方法存在特征提取效率低、依赖手工先验和数据不足等问题。

Method: HMSViT采用基于池化的分层和双重注意力机制，结合绝对位置编码，实现高效多尺度特征提取。设计了块掩码自监督学习框架，减少对标记数据的依赖，并通过多尺度解码器进行分割和分类。

Result: 在临床CCM数据集上，HMSViT在神经分割任务中达到61.34%的mIoU，诊断准确率为70.40%，优于Swin Transformer和HiViT等模型，且参数更少。

Conclusion: HMSViT表现出卓越、稳健且临床可行的性能，展示了其在真实诊断应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly half of diabetes
patients, requiring early detection. Corneal Confocal Microscopy (CCM) enables
non-invasive diagnosis, but automated methods suffer from inefficient feature
extraction, reliance on handcrafted priors, and data limitations. We propose
HMSViT, a novel Hierarchical Masked Self-Supervised Vision Transformer (HMSViT)
designed for corneal nerve segmentation and DPN diagnosis. Unlike existing
methods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention
mechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale
feature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and
integrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.
A block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT
that reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a
multi-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing
hierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation
and 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like
the Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation
accuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal
that integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature
extraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional
supervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that
HMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating
its potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.

Result: SceneCrafter在3D一致性、可控性和编辑质量上优于现有基线，实现了高真实感的场景编辑。

Conclusion: SceneCrafter为驾驶场景的3D一致编辑提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了真实感和可控性。

Abstract: Simulation is crucial for developing and evaluating autonomous vehicle (AV)
systems. Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to
synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely
synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty
in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on
the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the
simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions
such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in
computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation:
(1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street"
priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired
image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout
and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile
editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from
multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion
models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to
multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and
high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing
model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate
geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also
introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,
leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training
and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D
consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Dempster-Shafer理论（DST）的视觉幻觉检测方法，用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的感知和推理能力，并通过新数据集PRE-HAL揭示了模型在关系推理中的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在视觉幻觉现象，即视觉输入与文本输出不一致，这在安全关键AI应用中带来风险，需要评估基准和检测方法。

Method: 开发了PRE-HAL数据集，系统评估LVLMs的感知和推理能力；提出基于DST的视觉幻觉检测方法，通过不确定性估计高效捕捉高层特征冲突。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种LVLMs上优于五种基线不确定性指标，平均AUROC提升4%、10%和7%。

Conclusion: 新方法有效检测视觉幻觉，PRE-HAL数据集揭示了LVLMs在关系推理中的挑战，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: kVCT图像中的伪影影响临床决策，传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，结合特征重校准技术，专注于伪影区域和关键解剖结构。

Result: 生成高质量的MVCT样重建图像，减少重复高剂量MVCT扫描的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床提供了更可靠的kVCT图像，降低了患者的辐射暴露。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击通过隐藏触发器在输入中激活异常行为，对高安全性应用中的面部识别系统构成威胁，因此需要有效的检测和识别方法。

Method: 提出了一种新技术，用于检测面部识别网络是否被植入自然、物理可实现的触发器，并在给定被攻击网络时识别这些触发器。

Result: 在实验中，该方法在识别触发器（如绿色太阳镜或红色帽子）时的Top-5准确率达到74%，优于基线方法的56%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和识别面部识别系统中的自然触发器后门攻击，提升了系统安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Method: 采用DINOv2方法在200万张胎儿超声图像上预训练基础模型，并与多种预训练模型对比。

Result: 定制预训练在多个任务上表现最佳，且无需超参数调整或方法创新。

Conclusion: 在医疗领域开发基础模型时，应避免过度追求方法创新，注重数据定制和简单方法即可。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

Motivation: 探讨在2D视觉数据中，复杂的状态空间模型（SSMs）是否必要，提出更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合堆叠门控CNN块和傅里叶滤波门模块，采用四阶段分层设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MambaOutRS-t变体在UC Merced和AID上分别达到98.41%和95.99%的F1分数。

Conclusion: MambaOutRS证明通过门控卷积和频域模块可以高效替代SSMs，适用于计算效率优先的视觉任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Abstract: From optical sensors to microwave radars, leveraging the complementary
strengths of remote sensing (RS) sensors is crucial for achieving dense
spatio-temporal monitoring of our planet. In contrast, recent deep learning
models, whether task-specific or foundational, are often specific to single
sensors or to fixed combinations: adapting such models to different sensory
inputs requires both architectural changes and re-training, limiting
scalability and generalization across multiple RS sensors. On the contrary, a
single model able to modulate its feature representations to accept diverse
sensors as input would pave the way to agile and flexible multi-sensor RS data
processing. To address this, we introduce SMARTIES, a generic and versatile
foundation model lifting sensor-specific/dependent efforts and enabling
scalability and generalization to diverse RS sensors: SMARTIES projects data
from heterogeneous sensors into a shared spectrum-aware space, enabling the use
of arbitrary combinations of bands both for training and inference. To obtain
sensor-agnostic representations, we train a single, unified transformer model
reconstructing masked multi-sensor data with cross-sensor token mixup. On both
single- and multi-modal tasks across diverse sensors, SMARTIES outperforms
previous models that rely on sensor-specific pretraining. Our code and
pretrained models are available at https://gsumbul.github.io/SMARTIES.

*Lujun Li,Yiqun Wang,Radu State*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的时间序列多光谱图像重建框架，结合SAR数据，以解决云覆盖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云覆盖导致多光谱图像数据缺失或损坏，影响早期作物测绘。SAR数据不受云干扰但缺乏光谱细节，需结合两者优势。

Method: 利用时间序列MSI和SAR数据的互补信息，通过Vision Transformer的注意力机制重建云覆盖区域的MSI数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列MSI和SAR或仅时间序列MSI的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的Time-series ViT框架有效提升了云覆盖区域MSI图像的重建质量。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

the standard guide cane. The result shows superior performance of our device in
blind guidance.

Result: 在KITTI-360数据集上表现优于基线模型，LiDAR和相机领域均取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: NVSF是一种高效、自监督的多模态动态场景表示框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based framework,
referred to as Novel View Synthesis Framework (NVSF). It jointly learns the
implicit neural representation of space and time-varying scene for both LiDAR
and Camera. We test this on a real-world autonomous driving scenario containing
both static and dynamic scenes. Compared to existing multimodal dynamic NeRFs,
our framework is self-supervised, thus eliminating the need for 3D labels. For
efficient training and faster convergence, we introduce heuristic-based image
pixel sampling to focus on pixels with rich information. To preserve the local
features of LiDAR points, a Double Gradient based mask is employed. Extensive
experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset show that, compared to the baseline
models, our framework has reported best performance on both LiDAR and Camera
domain. Code of the model is available at

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning

VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable

Result: HOIverse提供了精确且密集的关系标注，并在现有场景图生成模型上进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: HOIverse数据集有望加速涉及人物的场景理解研究。

Abstract: When humans and robotic agents coexist in an environment, scene understanding
becomes crucial for the agents to carry out various downstream tasks like
navigation and planning. Hence, an agent must be capable of localizing and
identifying actions performed by the human. Current research lacks reliable
datasets for performing scene understanding within indoor environments where
humans are also a part of the scene. Scene Graphs enable us to generate a
structured representation of a scene or an image to perform visual scene
understanding. To tackle this, we present HOIverse a synthetic dataset at the
intersection of scene graph and human-object interaction, consisting of
accurate and dense relationship ground truths between humans and surrounding
objects along with corresponding RGB images, segmentation masks, depth images
and human keypoints. We compute parametric relations between various pairs of
objects and human-object pairs, resulting in an accurate and unambiguous
relation definitions. In addition, we benchmark our dataset on state-of-the-art
scene graph generation models to predict parametric relations and human-object
interactions. Through this dataset, we aim to accelerate research in the field
of scene understanding involving people.

TL;DR: PEVLM是一种并行编码策略，旨在提升视觉语言模型（VLM）的长视频理解效率，通过分块共享和注意力对齐，显著降低计算复杂度并保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准注意力机制在长视频理解中因二次复杂度导致的效率低下问题。

Method: 提出PEVLM，采用分块并行编码、共享sink、保留全注意力位置嵌入和注意力权重对齐。

Result: 在LongVideoBench上，PEVLM提升8.37%准确率，计算速度提升7.47倍，端到端延迟降低40%。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟长视频理解中表现优异，适用于自动驾驶等实际场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

TL;DR: xarrayvideo是一个Python库，利用视频压缩技术高效压缩多通道时空数据集，压缩比高达250倍，同时保持高保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理大规模地球系统数据集时，其空间、时间和光谱冗余性类似于视频，可以利用成熟的视频压缩技术。

Method: 通过ffmpeg使用标准视频编解码器将多通道时空数据集编码为视频。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上测试，压缩后PSNR表现优异，且不影响下游深度学习任务性能。

Conclusion: xarrayvideo为地球科学社区提供了一种高效处理大规模数据集的方法。

Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing
imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics
analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and
spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video
compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for
compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.
Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high
fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We
demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel
spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),
DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis
data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2
images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,
and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,
and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets,
DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the
machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at
significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without
compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is
observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their
respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance
prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an
efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation
datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to
the Earth science community. The library is available for use at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2-SGP框架通过支持集引导提示和低秩适应策略，解决了SAM2在医学图像分割中的手动提示依赖和领域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2在医学图像分割中依赖人工提示且存在领域偏移问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出SAM2-SGP框架，包括伪掩码生成模块（PMG）和伪掩码注意力模块（PMA），并采用低秩适应（LoRA）策略。

Result: 在多种医学影像模态上表现优于现有模型（如nnUNet、SwinUNet、SAM2和MedSAM2）。

Conclusion: SAM2-SGP有效解决了手动提示和领域偏移问题，显著提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Although new vision foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)
have significantly enhanced zero-shot image segmentation capabilities, reliance
on human-provided prompts poses significant challenges in adapting SAM2 to
medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, SAM2's performance in medical image
segmentation was limited by the domain shift issue, since it was originally
trained on natural images and videos. To address these challenges, we proposed
SAM2 with support-set guided prompting (SAM2-SGP), a framework that eliminated
the need for manual prompts. The proposed model leveraged the memory mechanism
of SAM2 to generate pseudo-masks using image-mask pairs from a support set via
a Pseudo-mask Generation (PMG) module. We further introduced a novel
Pseudo-mask Attention (PMA) module, which used these pseudo-masks to
automatically generate bounding boxes and enhance localized feature extraction
by guiding attention to relevant areas. Furthermore, a low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) strategy was adopted to mitigate the domain shift issue. The proposed
framework was evaluated on both 2D and 3D datasets across multiple medical
imaging modalities, including fundus photography, X-ray, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasound. The results demonstrated a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art models, such as nnUNet and SwinUNet, as well as foundation
models, such as SAM2 and MedSAM2, underscoring the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 精准肿瘤学需要准确的分子信息，但直接从基因组学获取成本高且耗时，限制了临床应用。

Method: PathLUPI在训练阶段利用转录组特权信息，提取基因组锚定的组织学嵌入，仅需WSI即可进行推理。

Result: 在49项分子肿瘤学任务中，PathLUPI表现优于传统方法，14项任务AUC≥0.80，5种主要癌症类型的生存队列C-index≥0.70。

Conclusion: PathLUPI通过编码分子上下文优化WSI表征，克服现有模型局限，为临床病理工作流提供新策略。

Abstract: Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these
directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use.
Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from
routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep
learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic
privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological
embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at
inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks
using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance
compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves
AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks
and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover,
PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures
associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs.
By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations,
PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel
strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for
wider clinical application.

Motivation: 解决医学超声图像因参数差异导致的视觉变异性问题，并满足非专业用户（如即时医疗场景）对图像解释和扫描指导的需求。

Method: 使用基于变压器的一阶段方法生成超声图像场景图（SG），结合LLMs优化SG表示，并利用SG指导扫描缺失的解剖结构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强超声图像的可解释性和易用性，有望实现超声技术的普及化。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

Motivation: 医学图像中的精确异常检测对临床决策至关重要，但现有方法缺乏细粒度区分（如良性vs.恶性肿瘤），且超声图像因设备和参数差异存在显著领域差距。

Method: UltraAD融合图像级令牌与可学习文本嵌入以增强定位性能，并通过记忆库存储少量图像样本和文本描述以实现细粒度分类。

Result: 在三个乳腺超声数据集上，UltraAD在异常定位和细粒度分类方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraAD通过结合视觉语言模型和少量示例，显著提升了超声图像中异常检测的精度和细粒度分类能力。

Abstract: Precise anomaly detection in medical images is critical for clinical
decision-making. While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection
methods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack
fine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.
Additionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and
acquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the
resulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a
vision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples
for generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To
enhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual
prototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed
prompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining
local representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a
memory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text
descriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During
training, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are
adapted to better align with medical data. UltraAD has been extensively
evaluated on three breast US datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
in both lesion localization and fine-grained medical classification. The code
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于检测边界框的投影模型选择方法，并发布了包含多样化鱼眼图像的新数据集FISHnCHIPS。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer robots the ability to capture human movements across a
wider field of view (FOV) than standard pinhole cameras, making them
particularly useful for applications in human-robot interaction and automotive
contexts. However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is
challenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While
various methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their
effectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been
systematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from
monocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of
pinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical
projection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in
close-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal
projection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of
advanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D
human pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the
appropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance
prediction quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate on our novel
dataset FISHnCHIPS, which features 3D human skeleton annotations in fisheye
images, including images from unconventional angles, such as extreme close-ups,
ground-mounted cameras, and wide-FOV poses, available at:

Motivation: 现有4D合成方法主要关注对象级生成或有限新视角的动态场景合成，无法生成多视角一致且沉浸式的动态4D场景。

Method: CoCo4D将4D场景合成分为动态前景建模和背景演化两部分，通过参考运动序列指导生成，并采用渐进式外推方案优化前景轨迹。

Conclusion: CoCo4D通过分而治之的策略和渐进式优化，成功生成了多视角一致且沉浸式的动态4D场景。

Abstract: Existing 4D synthesis methods primarily focus on object-level generation or
dynamic scene synthesis with limited novel views, restricting their ability to
generate multi-view consistent and immersive dynamic 4D scenes. To address
these constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating
detailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include
images. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion
typically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are
less pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two
responsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving
background, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt
and an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion
sequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the
synthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a
novel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the
moving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a
parametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent
blending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or
superior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. More results are presented on
our website https://colezwhy.github.io/coco4d/.

TL;DR: ProtoSolo是一种新型深度神经网络架构，通过单原型激活实现可解释的图像分类，简化解释复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型网络依赖多个原型协作决策，解释复杂。ProtoSolo旨在通过单原型激活简化分类和解释。

Method: 1. 单原型激活分类；2. 基于特征图的相似性比较；3. 非原型投影学习策略。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011和Stanford Cars数据集上，ProtoSolo分类性能优异，解释认知复杂度最低。

Conclusion: ProtoSolo通过单原型激活和特征图比较，实现了高性能分类和低解释复杂度。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProtoSolo, a novel deep neural architecture for
interpretable image classification inspired by prototypical networks such as
ProtoPNet. Existing prototype networks usually rely on the collaborative
decision-making of multiple prototypes to achieve the classification and
interpretation of a single category. In contrast, ProtoSolo only requires the
activation of a single prototype to complete the classification. This allows
the network to explain each category decision by only providing the features
that are most similar to the prototype of that category, significantly reducing
the cognitive complexity of the explanation. Secondly, we propose a
feature-based comparison method, which uses feature map instead of full-channel
feature vector as the object of similarity comparison and prototype learning.
This design enables ProtoSolo to utilize richer global information for
classification while relying on a single prototype activation. In addition, we
propose a non-prototype projection learning strategy, which preserves the
information association between the prototype and the training image patches
while avoiding the sharp change of the network structure caused by the
projection operation, thus avoiding its negative impact on the classification
performance. Experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show
that ProtoSolo achieves superior performance in classification tasks and
reaches the best level in terms of cognitive complexity of explanations
compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in audio-driven talking head
generation. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on
single-character scenarios. While some methods can create separate conversation
videos between two individuals, the critical challenge of generating unified
conversation videos with multiple physically co-present characters sharing the
same spatial environment remains largely unaddressed. This setting presents two
key challenges: audio-to-character correspondence control and the lack of
suitable datasets featuring multi-character talking videos within the same
scene. To address these challenges, we introduce Bind-Your-Avatar, an
MM-DiT-based model specifically designed for multi-talking-character video
generation in the same scene. Specifically, we propose (1) A novel framework
incorporating a fine-grained Embedding Router that binds `who' and `speak what'
together to address the audio-to-character correspondence control. (2) Two
methods for implementing a 3D-mask embedding router that enables frame-wise,
fine-grained control of individual characters, with distinct loss functions
based on observed geometric priors and a mask refinement strategy to enhance
the accuracy and temporal smoothness of the predicted masks. (3) The first
dataset, to the best of our knowledge, specifically constructed for
multi-talking-character video generation, and accompanied by an open-source
data processing pipeline, and (4) A benchmark for the dual-talking-characters
video generation, with extensive experiments demonstrating superior performance
over multiple state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 随着用户对高分辨率视频生成需求的增加，仅依赖潜在计算的方法已不足。通过两阶段方法（语义生成+细节合成）可以更高效地实现高分辨率输出。

Method: 1. 提出两种退化策略生成训练对，以更好地模拟基础模型的输出特性；2. 系统分析VSR模型行为（时间步采样策略和噪声增强效果）；3. 引入交错时间单元和稀疏局部注意力以减少计算开销。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有方法，消融研究验证了每个设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文为级联视频超分辨率生成提供了一个简单有效的基线，为未来高效级联合成系统的研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for efficient
video generation. However, as user expectations shift toward higher-resolution
outputs, relying solely on latent computation becomes inadequate. A promising
approach involves decoupling the process into two stages: semantic content
generation and detail synthesis. The former employs a computationally intensive
base model at lower resolutions, while the latter leverages a lightweight
cascaded video super-resolution (VSR) model to achieve high-resolution output.
In this work, we focus on studying key design principles for latter cascaded
VSR models, which are underexplored currently. First, we propose two
degradation strategies to generate training pairs that better mimic the output
characteristics of the base model, ensuring alignment between the VSR model and
its upstream generator. Second, we provide critical insights into VSR model
behavior through systematic analysis of (1) timestep sampling strategies, (2)
noise augmentation effects on low-resolution (LR) inputs. These findings
directly inform our architectural and training innovations. Finally, we
introduce interleaving temporal unit and sparse local attention to achieve
efficient training and inference, drastically reducing computational overhead.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over
existing methods, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each design
choice. Our work establishes a simple yet effective baseline for cascaded video
super-resolution generation, offering practical insights to guide future
advancements in efficient cascaded synthesis systems.

TL;DR: Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM) 是一种简单有效的渐进生成视觉媒体的框架，通过在多尺度表示上独立应用 Flow Matching，显著提升了图像和视频的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维视觉模态生成的计算密集型问题，同时避免现有多阶段架构的复杂性和定制化需求。

Method: DFM 在多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每个层级上独立应用 Flow Matching。

Result: 在 Imagenet-1k 512px 上，DFM 在 FDD 分数上比基础架构提升 35.2%，比最佳基线提升 26.4%，且在大模型微调中收敛更快。

Conclusion: DFM 通过单一模型、架构简单性和对现有训练流程的最小修改，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

TL;DR: GenHSI是一种无需训练的方法，用于生成长时间的人-场景交互视频，通过分阶段任务（脚本编写、预可视化、动画）解决现有问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模预训练视频扩散模型在生成长电影式视频时存在人-场景交互不真实、主体身份保存不足及训练成本高的问题。

Method: GenHSI将长视频生成任务分为三阶段：脚本编写（分解复杂任务）、预可视化（生成3D关键帧）、动画（利用视频扩散模型渲染）。

Result: 实验表明，GenHSI能从单张场景图像生成保持场景内容和角色身份的长视频，具有合理的人-场景交互。

Conclusion: GenHSI首次实现了无需训练即可生成具有一致相机姿态和任意数量角色动作的长视频序列。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have exhibited remarkable
capabilities in diverse video generation. However, existing solutions face
several challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos
with rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene
interaction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive
training. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation
of long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie
animation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by
subdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script
writing, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a
user description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to
generate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene
interactions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic
tasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes
(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf
video diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts
in a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need
for scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.
We are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera
pose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.
Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that
effectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible
human-scene interaction from a single image scene. Visit our project homepage

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于2D图像质量评估（IQA）的新视角选择方法，通过预测多视图环境下的SSIM来指导选择，避免了复杂3D建模，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如FisheRF和ActiveNeRF在3D空间中最小化不确定性或最大化信息增益来选择最佳视角，但需要针对不同3D表示进行专门设计且计算复杂。本文将其重新定义为2D图像质量评估任务，简化了流程。

Method: 提出了一种跨参考IQA框架，训练模型在多视图环境下预测SSIM，用于指导视角选择，无需依赖真实图像或复杂的3D建模。

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现了显著的定量和定性改进，且运行速度比现有方法快14-33倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅对3D表示无关，还大幅提升了效率和性能，为新颖视角合成和3D重建中的视角选择提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: We tackle active view selection in novel view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction. Existing methods like FisheRF and ActiveNeRF select the next
best view by minimizing uncertainty or maximizing information gain in 3D, but
they require specialized designs for different 3D representations and involve
complex modelling in 3D space. Instead, we reframe this as a 2D image quality
assessment (IQA) task, selecting views where current renderings have the lowest
quality. Since ground-truth images for candidate views are unavailable,
full-reference metrics like PSNR and SSIM are inapplicable, while no-reference
metrics, such as MUSIQ and MANIQA, lack the essential multi-view context.
Inspired by a recent cross-referencing quality framework CrossScore, we train a
model to predict SSIM within a multi-view setup and use it to guide view
selection. Our cross-reference IQA framework achieves substantial quantitative
and qualitative improvements across standard benchmarks, while being agnostic
to 3D representations, and runs 14-33 times faster than previous methods.

Method: 使用CIFAR10噪声和模糊图像，通过消融实验比较不同变体（如替换或移除SimpleGate、SCA和LayerNorm）的性能。

Result: SimpleGate和简化注意力机制优于传统方法，LayerNorm对训练稳定性至关重要。

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient
deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted
with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel
Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different
variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future
work.

Method: UniVLA将视觉、语言和动作信号建模为离散标记序列，结合世界建模从大规模视频数据中学习。

Result: 在多个仿真基准测试中取得新最优成绩，如LIBERO上95.5%的成功率，显著超越之前的方法。

Conclusion: UniVLA展示了在机器人操作和自动驾驶等领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have garnered significant attention for
their potential in advancing robotic manipulation. However, previous approaches
predominantly rely on the general comprehension capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) to generate action signals, often overlooking the rich temporal
and causal structure embedded in visual observations. In this paper, we present
UniVLA, a unified and native multimodal VLA model that autoregressively models
vision, language, and action signals as discrete token sequences. This
formulation enables flexible multimodal tasks learning, particularly from
large-scale video data. By incorporating world modeling during post-training,
UniVLA captures causal dynamics from videos, facilitating effective transfer to
downstream policy learning--especially for long-horizon tasks. Our approach
sets new state-of-the-art results across several widely used simulation
benchmarks, including CALVIN, LIBERO, and Simplenv-Bridge, significantly
surpassing previous methods. For example, UniVLA achieves 95.5% average success
rate on LIBERO benchmark, surpassing pi0-FAST's 85.5%. We further demonstrate
its broad applicability on real-world ALOHA manipulation and autonomous
driving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Radial Attention的稀疏注意力机制，通过模拟时空能量衰减现象，显著降低了视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型在生成高质量视频时，由于时间维度的增加导致计算成本高昂，作者发现时空能量衰减现象，并基于此提出高效解决方案。

Method: 提出Radial Attention，一种复杂度为O(n log n)的稀疏注意力机制，通过静态注意力掩码模拟能量衰减，减少计算密度。

Result: 实验表明，Radial Attention在多个数据集上保持视频质量，计算速度提升1.9倍，训练成本降低4.4倍，推理速度提升3.7倍。

Conclusion: Radial Attention是一种高效且可扩展的注意力机制，显著提升了视频扩散模型的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动作合成方法受限于固定骨架拓扑或高维变形空间的优化成本，AnimaX旨在将视频动作知识高效迁移到3D领域，支持任意骨架的多样化动画。

Method: AnimaX将3D动作表示为多视角、多帧的2D姿态图，结合视频-姿态扩散模型，利用共享位置编码和模态感知嵌入确保时空对齐，最终通过三角测量和逆运动学生成3D动画。

Result: 在160,000个动画序列数据集上训练，AnimaX在VBench评测中表现出色，实现了泛化性、动作保真度和效率的先进水平。

Conclusion: AnimaX为类别无关的3D动画提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了动作生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: We present AnimaX, a feed-forward 3D animation framework that bridges the
motion priors of video diffusion models with the controllable structure of
skeleton-based animation. Traditional motion synthesis methods are either
restricted to fixed skeletal topologies or require costly optimization in
high-dimensional deformation spaces. In contrast, AnimaX effectively transfers
video-based motion knowledge to the 3D domain, supporting diverse articulated
meshes with arbitrary skeletons. Our method represents 3D motion as multi-view,
multi-frame 2D pose maps, and enables joint video-pose diffusion conditioned on
template renderings and a textual motion prompt. We introduce shared positional
encodings and modality-aware embeddings to ensure spatial-temporal alignment
between video and pose sequences, effectively transferring video priors to
motion generation task. The resulting multi-view pose sequences are
triangulated into 3D joint positions and converted into mesh animation via
inverse kinematics. Trained on a newly curated dataset of 160,000 rigged
sequences, AnimaX achieves state-of-the-art results on VBench in
generalization, motion fidelity, and efficiency, offering a scalable solution
for category-agnostic 3D animation. Project page:

Motivation: 解决现实数据库应用中复杂的SQL问题调试瓶颈，并推动开源模型在数据库任务中的发展。

Method: 引入BIRD-CRITIC基准和Six-Gym训练环境，采用SQL-Rewind策略和f-Plan Boosting方法。

Result: Bird-Fixer代理在BIRD-CRITIC基准上表现优于主流专有模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为SQL调试能力的民主化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

Method: 引入提升和降低范式，设计轻量级、模块化且可并行的高阶图数据库原型，支持超图、节点元组等结构。

Result: 原型系统在大规模高阶OLTP和OLAP工作负载中表现优异，提升图神经网络准确性44%。

Conclusion: HO-GDBs在保证低延迟和高吞吐的同时，扩展了传统图数据库的功能，支持高阶分析任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.

Method: 调查了50多所美国顶尖研究机构的HPC能力，包括计算容量、架构设计、治理模式和能效。

Result: 大学HPC增长缓慢（年增长率约18%），远低于国家（43%）和工业界（78%），需采用联合计算等新模式。

Conclusion: 建议通过联合计算、资源共享等策略，实现更公平和可持续的HPC支持，推动国家研究目标。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national

Result: 提出了一种高效方法，能够在保证高可靠性的同时，实现更均匀的区域覆盖。

Conclusion: 新算法在可靠性和区域覆盖方面优于基于Fruchterman-Reingold的改进方法。

Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in
Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance $1$.
These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks,
including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such
an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly
reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered
inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball
graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary
conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to
determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single
vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an
efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a
location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in
many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often
contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to
improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a
location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the
reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within
some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high
reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a
modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.

while preserving decentralization guarantees. The architecture reflects lessons
from Web2 systems: it separates control and data planes, uses erasure coding
with low replication overhead and minimal repair bandwidth, and operates over a
dedicated backbone connecting RPC and storage nodes. Reads are paid, which
incentivizes good performance. Shelby also introduces a novel auditing protocol
that provides strong cryptoeconomic guarantees without compromising
performance, a common limitation of other decentralized solutions. The result
is a decentralized system that brings Web2-grade performance to
production-scale, read-intensive Web3 applications.

TL;DR: 论文分析了闪电网络作为货币系统的特性，指出其与比特币基础层结算模式的差异，并揭示其可能形成流动性中心寡头垄断的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究闪电网络在高交易需求下的表现及其对BTC交易费用的影响，探讨其作为金融系统的潜在风险。

Method: 通过数学模型、博弈论证明和复杂性分析，研究闪电网络的运作机制和代理行为。

Result: 闪电网络在高需求下可能形成寡头垄断的流动性中心，具有不透明、系统性脆弱等特征，且关闭通道变得经济不可行。

Conclusion: 闪电网络并非比特币的简单扩展，而是一个具有影子银行特征的合成金融系统，缺乏储备纪律和透明度。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal analysis of the Lightning Network as a monetary
system structurally diverging from Bitcoin's base-layer settlement model. We
demonstrate that under increasing transaction demand, BTC transaction fees rise
superlinearly due to throughput constraints, while Lightning Network routing
costs approach a bounded asymptote. Using mathematical modeling, game-theoretic
proofs, and complexity analysis, we show that Lightning enables indefinite
off-chain operation via the emergence of liquidity hub oligopolies. These hubs
exhibit properties of unregulated financial intermediaries, including rent
extraction, opacity, and systemic fragility. Strategic agent models show that
channel closure becomes economically infeasible, and routing problems approach
hardness limits in P-Space complexity. We conclude that Lightning does not
merely extend Bitcoin, but constitutes a synthetic financial system with
shadowbank characteristics, lacking reserve discipline, transparency, or
enforceable settlement guarantees.

Result: 在73个真实和合成图上验证，性能优于五种最先进实现，速度提升2.5x至5.83x。

Conclusion: 新方法和启发式显著提升了SSSP算法的效率和实用性。

Abstract: The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is well-known for the
challenges in developing fast, practical, and work-efficient parallel
algorithms. This work introduces a novel shortest path search method. It allows
paths with different lengths to be extended in parallel at the cost of almost
negligible repeated relaxations. A dynamic-stepping heuristic is proposed for
the method to efficiently reduce the extended paths and the synchronizations. A
traversal-optimization heuristic is proposed to improve the method by
efficiently reducing the created paths and alleviating the load imbalance.
Based on the method, the two heuristics are used to develop a practical SSSP
algorithm, which tactfully reduces workload and overhead. The heuristics and
the algorithm were evaluated on 73 real-world and synthetic graphs. The
algorithm was also compared with five state-of-the-art SSSP implementations. On
each GAP benchmark suite graph except Road, its speedup to the best achieved by
these five implementations is 2.5x to 5.83x.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在基于代理的网络中构建最小生成树（MST）和广度优先搜索（BFS）树的问题，提出了高效的算法，显著改善了内存和时间效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布式计算模型（如消息传递模型）中已研究过MST和BFS树的构建，但在基于移动代理的网络中，这些问题尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种确定性算法，在同步模型中构建BFS树和MST，无需预先知道图的参数（如节点数、边数、直径或最大度数）。算法通过代理的移动和通信实现。

Result: BFS树构建时间为O(min(DΔ, m log n) + n log n + Δ log² n)轮，内存为O(log n)位；MST构建时间为O(n log n + Δ log² n)轮，内存为O(log n)位。

Conclusion: 算法在内存和时间效率上显著优于现有方法，实现了近乎线性的时间复杂度和低内存消耗。

Abstract: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) tree constructions
are classical problems in distributed computing, traditionally studied in the
message-passing model, where static nodes communicate via messages. This paper
investigates MST and BFS tree construction in an agent-based network, where
mobile agents explore a graph and compute. Each node hosts one agent, and
communication occurs when agents meet at a node. We consider $n$ agents
initially dispersed (one per node) in an anonymous, arbitrary $n$-node,
$m$-edge graph $G$. The goal is to construct the BFS and MST trees from this
configuration such that each tree edge is known to at least one of its
endpoints, while minimizing time and memory per agent. We work in a synchronous
model and assume agents have no prior knowledge of any graph parameters such as
$n$, $m$, $D$, $\Delta$ (graph diameter and maximum degree). Prior work solves
BFS in $O(D\Delta)$ rounds with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent, assuming the root
is known. We give a deterministic algorithm that constructs the BFS tree in
$O(\min(D\Delta, m\log n) + n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds using $O(\log
n)$ bits per agent without root knowledge. To determine the root, we solve
leader election and MST construction. We elect a leader and construct the MST
in $O(n\log n + \Delta \log^2 n)$ rounds, with $O(\log n)$ bits per agent.
Prior MST algorithms require $O(m + n\log n)$ rounds and $\max(\Delta, \log n)
\log n$ bits. Our results significantly improve memory efficiency and time,
achieving nearly linear-time leader election and MST. Agents are assumed to
know $\lambda$, the maximum identifier, bounded by a polynomial in $n$.

Motivation: 大规模科学实验产生海量数据，现有数据管理和工作流决策方法效率不足，缺乏动态模型以优化解决方案。

Method: 利用PanDA工作流管理系统的作业执行记录，识别关键性能指标，并开发生成AI模型模拟负载时间序列。

Result: 确定了排队时间、错误率和远程数据访问等关键指标，并构建了包含显性和隐性特征的生成模型。

Conclusion: 研究为优化数据管理和工作流决策提供了动态模型和工具，有望提升科学协作的效率。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

TL;DR: PS-WL是一种新型的磨损均衡方案，通过直接平衡故障风险而非磨损，显著降低SSD阵列的故障风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统磨损均衡方案忽视了磨损与故障概率的非线性关系，可能导致老化磁盘过早失效。

Method: PS-WL引入基于实际故障概率的“有效寿命”模型，并通过PID控制器指导磨损均衡操作，减少性能开销。

Result: PS-WL在多种系统配置和工作负载下显著降低性能开销和整体故障风险。

Conclusion: PS-WL通过直接优化可靠性，构建了更安全、高效和稳定的可扩展存储系统。

Abstract: As flash-based Solid State Drive (SSD) arrays become essential to modern data
centers, scaling these arrays to meet explosive data growth is a frequent and
critical operation. However, the conventional wear-leveling (WL) paradigm
applied during scaling suffers from a fundamental flaw: it ignores the
non-linear relationship between wear and failure probability, potentially
pushing the most vulnerable, aged disks towards premature failure. To address
this critical issue at its root, we propose the Probability-Sensitive Wear
Leveling (PS-WL) scheme, which shifts the optimization goal from balancing wear
to directly balancing failure risk. At its core, PS-WL introduces an "effective
lifetime" model derived from a realistic failure probability to more accurately
assess disk lifetime. This model guides a PID controller for wear leveling
operation, with a conservative zone minimizes performance overhead by
restricting warm data migration. Comprehensive simulations validate the
superiority of PS-WL over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate
that our approach significantly reduces performance overhead while, most
critically, consistently and effectively lowering the aggregated array failure
risk across diverse system configurations and workloads. This proves that by
directly optimizing for reliability, PS-WL builds a scalable storage system
that is, by design, fundamentally safer, more efficient, and more stable.

TL;DR: WiLLM是一个开源无线系统，专为移动LLM服务设计，通过分布式推理和创新的网络切片架构解决现有基础设施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，现有无线基础设施难以支持移动LLM服务，需要新的架构创新。

Method: WiLLM在核心网络中部署LLM，提出“Tree-Branch-Fruit”网络切片扩展，并引入双层面切片架构和应用层隧道机制。

Result: WiLLM实现了细粒度资源分配和兼容性，发布了首个LLM无线通信数据集和基准测试，并通过智能眼镜案例验证了实用性。

Conclusion: WiLLM为跨层优化和AI-电信融合提供了开放平台，推动了移动LLM服务的实际应用。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of LLMs threatens to overwhelm existing wireless
infrastructure, necessitating architectural innovations for burgeoning mobile
LLM services. This paper introduces WiLLM, the first open-source wireless
system specifically designed for these services. First, we establish a new
paradigm by deploying LLMs in core networks (CNs) with abundant GPUs. This
enables distributed inference services, strategically positioning LLM inference
at the convergence of backbone bandwidth and the cellular network's edge.
Second, we propose an innovative "Tree-Branch-Fruit" extension to the
conventional network slicing architecture. This specialized design allows
telecom operators to monetize LLM services through slice subscriptions while
maintaining infrastructure ownership. Finally, to realize this vision, WiLLM
addresses critical limitations in current solutions with several novel
capabilities. It features enhanced slice orchestration through a dual-layer
slicing architecture, enabling coordinated multi-UE-multi-slice scheduling for
finer-grained resource allocation. To ensure universal compatibility, an
application-layer tunneling mechanism allows legacy devices without native
slicing to access LLM slice services without hardware upgrades. Furthermore,
its dual-mode scheduling and cross-layer APIs support flexible deployment from
CNs to servers. Built on OpenAirInterface, WiLLM extends this established
framework, lowering the adoption barrier for researchers. We also release the
first LLM wireless communication dataset with 1,649,996 records and
synchronized 58-dimensional metrics, alongside two benchmarks. A case study
with smart glasses demonstrates practical viability for resource-constrained
devices. WiLLM aims to foster an open platform for cross-layer optimization and
AI-telecom convergence. The code, datasets, and hardware details are available

Motivation: 城市核爆炸后通信基础设施可能严重受损，及时传播辐射数据对减少伤亡至关重要。

Method: 使用ONE模拟器构建动态场景，整合应急响应者、无人机和民用设备作为DTN节点，评估Epidemic和PRoPHET协议性能。

Result: 两种协议均实现高消息传递率，PRoPHET网络开销更低但延迟更高。

Conclusion: DTN解决方案能在基础设施受损时确保关键辐射数据传播，支持应急响应和疏散安全。

Abstract: The detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND) in an urban area would
cause catastrophic damage, followed by hazardous radioactive fallout. Timely
dissemination of radiation data is crucial for evacuation and casualty
reduction. However, conventional communication infrastructure is likely to be
severely disrupted. This study designs and builds a pseudorealistic,
geospatially and temporally dynamic post-nuclear event (PNE) scenario using the
Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. It integrates radiation
sensing by emergency responders, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and civilian
devices as dynamic nodes within Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). The performance
of two DTN routing protocols, Epidemic and PRoPHET, was evaluated across
multiple PNE phases. Both protocols achieve high message delivery rates, with
PRoPHET exhibiting lower network overhead but higher latency. Findings
demonstrate the potential of DTN-based solutions to support emergency response
and evacuation safety by ensuring critical radiation data propagation despite
severe infrastructure damage.

Method: 采用多领导者车辆配备户外LiFi通信节点的混合架构，实现高速低延迟通信。

Result: 提出的架构有效降低了端到端延迟。

Conclusion: 混合通信架构是解决自动驾驶车队延迟问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Platooning within autonomous vehicles has proven effective in addressing
driver shortages and reducing fuel consumption. However, as platooning lengths
increase, traditional C-V2X (cellular vehicle-to-everything) architectures are
susceptible to end-to-end (E2E) latency increases. This is due to the necessity
of relaying information through multiple hops from the leader vehicle to the
last vehicle. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid
communication architecture based on a simulation that integrates light fidelity
(LiFi) and C-V2X. The proposed architecture introduces multiple-leader vehicles
equipped with outdoor LiFi communication nodes in platoons to achieve
high-speed and low-delay communication between leader vehicles, which reduces
E2E delay.

Motivation: 传统模型假设节点均匀或随机分布，无法反映实际部署中的复杂空间模式，因此需要更精确的拓扑控制方法。

Result: 高分形维数拓扑在相同条件下表现出更强的韧性和吞吐量，优于随机、小世界和无标度网络模型。

Conclusion: 分形几何可作为设计可扩展高效无线网状网络架构的新范式。

Abstract: Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) depend on the spatial distribution of nodes,
which directly influences connectivity, routing efficiency, and overall network
performance. Conventional models typically assume uniform or random node
placement, which inadequately represent the complex, hierarchical spatial
patterns observed in practical deployments. In this study, we present a novel
algorithm that constructs WMN topologies with tunable fractal dimensions,
allowing precise control over spatial self-similarity. By systematically
varying the fractal dimension, the algorithm generates network layouts spanning
a continuum of spatial complexities, ranging from sparse fragmented clusters to
dense, cohesive structures. Through NS-3 simulations, Key performance metrics
including throughput, latency, jitter, and packet delivery ratio were evaluated
across a range of fractal dimensions. Comparative evaluations against classical
random, small-world, and scale-free network models reveal that high-dimensional
fractal topologies achieve enhanced resilience and throughput under equivalent
conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fractal geometry as a
design paradigm for scalable and efficient WMN architectures.

Motivation: 在密集区域，RAN节点资源在低流量期间可能未被充分利用，需动态调整以节省能源。

Method: 提出CORMO-RAN，通过动态激活计算节点和xApp的无损迁移，平衡服务可用性、可扩展性和能耗。

Result: 实验显示，CORMO-RAN能节省RIC集群高达64%的能源消耗。

Conclusion: CORMO-RAN有效优化了RAN的能源效率，同时满足xApp的多样性和迁移需求。

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a key paradigm to attain unprecedented
flexibility of the RAN via disaggregation and Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-based applications called xApps. In dense areas with many active RAN
nodes, compute resources are engineered to support potentially hundreds of
xApps monitoring and controlling the RAN to achieve operator's intents.
However, such resources might become underutilized during low-traffic periods,
where most cells are sleeping and, given the reduced RAN complexity, only a few
xApps are needed for its control. In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a
data-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp
load to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be
turned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration.
CORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and
energy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN
performance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in
state size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration
strategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource
availability and requirements. We prototype CORMO-RAN as an rApp, and
experimentally evaluate it on an O-RAN private 5G testbed hosted on a Red Hat
OpenShift cluster with commercial radio units. Results demonstrate that
CORMO-RAN is effective in minimizing energy consumption of the RAN Intelligent
Controller (RIC) cluster, yielding up to 64% energy saving when compared to
existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决多语言编程中单一模型效率低与独立模型资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 结合基础模型、共享LoRA模块和语言特定LoRA模块，联合优化并动态路由。

Result: MoLE在参数效率上优于独立模型，在准确性上优于单一共享模型。

Conclusion: MoLE为多语言编程提供了一种高效且专业的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

Motivation: 当前并行语言主要关注处理器和线程，导致数据处理困难且偏离算法初衷。

Result: AuDaLa编程自然且支持高度并行，形式化验证可行。

Conclusion: 数据自主范式为并行编程提供了新思路，AuDaLa语言展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Nowadays, the main advances in computational power are due to parallelism.
However, most parallel languages have been designed with a focus on processors
and threads. This makes dealing with data and memory in programs hard, which
distances the implementation from its original algorithm. We propose a new
paradigm for parallel programming, the data-autonomous paradigm, where
computation is performed by autonomous data elements. Programs in this paradigm
are focused on making the data collaborate in a highly parallel fashion. We
furthermore present AuDaLa, the first data autonomous programming language, and
provide a full formalisation that includes a type system and operational
semantics. Programming in AuDaLa is very natural, as illustrated by examples,
albeit in a style very different from sequential and contemporary parallel
programming. Additionally, it lends itself for the formal verification of
parallel programs, which we demonstrate.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的静态方法，用于系统测试代码的故障定位（TCFL），无需执行测试用例，通过修剪执行轨迹和错误消息提示LLM，显著提高了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统故障定位依赖重复执行，但面对非确定性失败或高执行成本时效率低下。测试代码的故障同样重要，但现有LLM方法主要关注系统代码而非测试代码。

Method: 利用单次失败执行日志，通过三种新算法估计测试执行轨迹，修剪后结合错误消息提示LLM，对潜在故障位置进行排序。

Result: 修剪后的轨迹与实际轨迹匹配度达90% F1分数，LLM推理时间减少34%，块级TCFL在Top-3命中率达81%。

Conclusion: 静态LLM驱动的TCFL方法高效且实用，尤其在复杂系统测试代码中表现优异，块级定位提供了实用平衡。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically
relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However,
repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic
failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large
Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused
on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often
complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in
practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test
code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.
Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution
trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely
involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is
used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box,
system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is
applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate
our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset
of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show
that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of
around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the
LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our
results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance,
narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81%
hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).

rich foundation for a variety of research and development tasks, including but
not limited to machine learning applications, formal verification, optimization
analysis, and software engineering tool evaluation in the context of low-level
smart contract code. To the best of our knowledge at the time of writing,
YulCode is the first and only publicly available dataset that focuses
specifically on Yul, an intermediate language designed for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM). As such, it fills a critical gap in the current ecosystem of
smart contract datasets and opens new avenues for research and tooling aimed at
low-level contract analysis and generation.

TL;DR: PALM结合符号执行与LLM辅助测试生成，通过AST分析枚举路径并生成可执行变体，避免传统约束求解的限制，提供交互式前端可视化路径覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号执行受限于复杂特征的建模和约束求解能力，而LLM缺乏系统路径枚举机制，PALM旨在结合两者优势解决这些问题。

Method: PALM通过静态AST分析枚举路径，生成带断言的可执行变体，利用LLM生成测试，提供交互式前端可视化路径覆盖。

Result: 用户研究表明，PALM的前端帮助用户更好地理解路径覆盖，并验证生成的测试覆盖了目标路径。

Conclusion: PALM成功结合符号执行与LLM，提供了一种高效且用户友好的测试生成方法。

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering
systematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it
is fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code
including library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability
of underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex
features remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test
inputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths
and often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting
an LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In
this paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic
path enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates
possible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an
executable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This
avoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead
constructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the
first to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage
alongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they
exercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend
helps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are
actually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and
visualization of their path profiles.

TL;DR: 论文研究了二进制分解中函数调用图（FCG）因编译设置不同而产生的变化及其对现有方法的影响，提出了识别最优分解的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二进制分解方法依赖函数调用关系的相似性，但不同编译设置（尤其是函数内联）会导致FCG显著变化，影响分解效果。

Method: 构建了由17种编译器、6种优化和4种架构生成的数据集，分析FCG的变化和映射关系，评估现有方法并提出最优分解方法。

Result: FCG大小变化显著，但仍通过三种映射关联；现有方法在跨编译器评估中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现有方法在稳定性和覆盖率上存在问题，提出的最优分解方法为改进方向。

Abstract: Binary decomposition, which decomposes binary files into modules, plays a
critical role in binary reuse detection. Existing binary decomposition works
either apply anchor-based methods by extending anchor functions to generate
modules, or apply clustering-based methods by using clustering algorithms to
group binary functions, which all rely on that reused code shares similar
function call relationships. However, we find that function call graphs (FCGs)
vary a lot when using different compilation settings, especially with diverse
function inlining decisions.
  In this work, we conduct the first systematic empirical study on the variance
of FCGs compiled by various compilation settings and explore its effect on
binary decomposition methods. We first construct a dataset compiled by 17
compilers, using 6 optimizations to 4 architectures and analyze the changes and
mappings of the FCGs. We find that the size of FCGs changes dramatically, while
the FCGs are still linked by three different kinds of mappings. Then we
evaluate the existing works under the FCG variance, and results show that
existing works are facing great challenges when conducting cross-compiler
evaluation with diverse optimization settings. Finally, we propose a method to
identify the optimal decomposition and compare the existing decomposition works
with the optimal decomposition. Existing works either suffer from low coverage
or cannot generate stable community similarities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重构是软件开发与维护中的常见活动，但目前仍依赖人工分析，容易引入缺陷。研究旨在评估LLM智能体在Haskell代码重构中的效果。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，包含代码分析、重构执行、验证和调试等角色，并在开源Haskell代码库上测试其有效性。

Result: 实验结果显示，系统平均降低了11.03%的代码复杂度，提升了22.46%的代码质量，性能效率提高了13.27%，内存分配优化达14.57%。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统能有效支持函数式编程语言的重构，提升可维护性并推动自动化开发流程。

Abstract: Refactoring is a constant activity in software development and maintenance.
Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However,
this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze
the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we
put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate
the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to
evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and
semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent
system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code
analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the
effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we
conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The
results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based
multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an
improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance
efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was
optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based
multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional
programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems
integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can
enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着系统复杂性增加，团队协作和知识共享变得至关重要，但PP的采用仍不一致，研究旨在理解其影响因素。

Method: 在挪威一家成熟的敏捷公司进行探索性单案例研究，通过两轮访谈和主题分析收集数据。

Result: 发现PP的参与受多种因素影响，包括工作贡献感知、公司态度、资源等。

Conclusion: 长期参与PP需实践验证其益处，并根据团队特点调整。研究对希望将PP融入团队工作流程的从业者有参考价值。

Abstract: Context: Pair programming (PP) is more relevant than ever. As modern systems
grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have
become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption
remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to
understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well
as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory
single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data
through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and
performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is
that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to
daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team
attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP
engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits
with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the
practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is
also beneficial. Our findings will be beneficial for software practitioners
seeking to make PP an integrated part of their team's workflow.

TL;DR: Reptile是一个工具，结合规则和GPT-4，将正则表达式转换为DPL模式，解决了迁移到现代日志分析平台的成本高和易出错问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业日志分析平台迁移时，手动转换正则表达式到新语言（如DPL）成本高且易出错。

Method: 结合规则和GPT-4，部分转换正则表达式为DPL模式，并优化结果。

Result: 成功转换73.7%的正则表达式，优化后的F1分数和MCC超过0.91。

Conclusion: Reptile为迁移到现代日志分析平台提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统映射研究分析了瀑布模型在计算模拟中的表现，发现尽管敏捷方法主导现代软件开发，瀑布模型仍存在于混合方法中。研究分析了68篇文献，揭示了模拟方法、工具、地域趋势及对Royce原始模型的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管瀑布模型在混合方法中仍有应用，但对其在学术研究中的模拟表现关注不足。

Method: 通过结构化搜索学术数据库，筛选68篇文献，从四个维度进行分析：模拟方法、工具、地域趋势及对Royce原始模型的忠实度。

Result: 离散事件模拟最常用，开源工具（如Python）近年增多，但无研究完全忠实于Royce原始模型。

Conclusion: 瀑布模型模拟虽小众但存在，需开发易用工具并研究其与现代混合方法的结合。

Abstract: This systematic mapping study examines how the Waterfall Model has been
represented in computational simulations within peer-reviewed literature. While
Agile methodologies dominate contemporary software design practices, the
Waterfall Model persists, particularly, within hybrid approaches that fuse
structured, sequential workflows with the adaptability of agile practices.
Despite its continued presence, little attention has been given to how the
Waterfall Model is simulated in research contexts. A structured search of major
academic databases identified 68 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000
and 2024. After applying inclusion criteria, selected studies were analyzed
across four dimensions: (1) simulation methodologies (e.g., discrete-event
simulation, system dynamics), (2) platforms and tools (e.g., Simphony.NET,
SimPy), (3) geographic and temporal trends, and (4) fidelity to Royce's
original seven-phase model. Discrete-event simulation was most commonly used,
reflecting the model's sequential nature. Early work relied on proprietary
platforms, while recent studies increasingly use open-source, Python-based
tools. No studies fully implemented Royce's original formulation, most employed
adaptations. These findings suggest that although niche, simulation of the
Waterfall Model is present in academic discourse. This work highlights the need
for accessible modeling tools and calls for future research that integrates the
waterfall software process model with modern hybrid practices.

TL;DR: SABER是一种动态批处理策略，通过实时调整决策提升CodeLLM的服务性能，显著提高吞吐量并降低延迟波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统使用静态批处理配置，无法适应请求速率波动或异构工作负载，导致SLA违规和性能不稳定。

Method: 提出SABER，动态预测每个请求的SLA可行性并实时调整批处理决策。

Result: SABER比最佳静态配置提高吞吐量26%，降低延迟波动45%，无需手动调整或重启服务。

Conclusion: SLA感知的自适应调度是实现高性能CodeLLM服务的关键。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly integrated into modern
software development workflows, yet efficiently serving them in
resource-constrained, self-hosted environments remains a significant challenge.
Existing LLM serving systems employs Continuous Batching for throughput
improvement. However, they rely on static batch size configurations that cannot
adapt to fluctuating request rates or heterogeneous workloads, leading to
frequent SLA (Service Level Agreement) violations and unstable performance. In
this study, We propose SABER, a dynamic batching strategy that predicts
per-request SLA feasibility and adjusts decisions in real time. SABER improves
goodput by up to 26% over the best static configurations and reduces latency
variability by up to 45%, all without manual tuning or service restarts. Our
results demonstrate that SLA-aware, adaptive scheduling is key to robust,
high-performance CodeLLM serving.

Method: 采用系统映射研究（SMS）分析29项研究，并通过德尔菲研究评估27个DX因素对21名第三方开发者的影响。

Result: 关键影响因素包括财务成本、技术资源、市场进入门槛和财务收益。

Conclusion: DX对SECO的可持续性至关重要，研究结果为解决开发者关键问题提供了建议。

Abstract: Context: Developer experience (DX) plays a key role in developers'
performance and their continued involvement in a software ecosystem (SECO)
platform. While researchers and practitioners have recognized several factors
affecting DX in SECO platforms, a clear roadmap of the most influential factors
is still missing. This is particularly important given the direct impact on
developers' interest in SECO and their ongoing engagement with the common
technological platform. Goal: This work aims to identify key DX factors and
understand how they influence third-party developers' decisions to adopt and
keep contributing to a SECO. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping study
(SMS), analyzing 29 studies to assess the state-of-the-art of DX in SECO.
Additionally, we conducted a Delphi study to evaluate the influence of 27 DX
factors (identified in our SMS) from the perspective of 21 third-party
developers to adopt and keep contributing to a SECO. Results: The factors that
most strongly influence developers' adoption and ongoing contributions to a
SECO are: financial costs for using the platform, desired technical resources
for development, low barriers to entry into the applications market, and more
financial gains. Conclusion: DX is essential for the success and sustainability
of SECO. Our set of DX factors provides valuable insights and recommendations
for researchers and practitioners to address key DX concerns from the
perspective of third-party developers.

TL;DR: 该研究通过双机器学习方法（DML）扩展了Dell关于秘鲁殖民时期Mita制度长期经济影响的研究，发现其负面影响比原先估计的更显著且空间异质性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Mita制度的长期经济影响，并利用更灵活的机器学习方法改进因果效应估计。

Method: 采用双机器学习方法（PLR和IRM模型），纳入高维协变量和非线性处理效应，分析Mita边界对现代经济的影响。

Result: Mita的经济遗留效应比原先估计的更显著且空间异质性更强，尤其是靠近Potosi的地区。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能更准确地捕捉历史干预的真实因果效应，揭示区域经济不平等的深层持续性。

Abstract: This study examines the long-term economic impact of the colonial Mita system
in Peru, building on Melissa Dell's foundational work on the enduring effects
of forced labor institutions. The Mita, imposed by the Spanish colonial
authorities from 1573 to 1812, required indigenous communities within a
designated boundary to supply labor to mines, primarily near Potosi. Dell's
original regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, leveraging the Mita
boundary to estimate the Mita's legacy on modern economic outcomes, indicates
that regions subjected to the Mita exhibit lower household consumption levels
and higher rates of child stunting. In this paper, I replicate Dell's results
and extend this analysis. I apply Double Machine Learning (DML) methods--the
Partially Linear Regression (PLR) model and the Interactive Regression Model
(IRM)--to further investigate the Mita's effects. DML allows for the inclusion
of high-dimensional covariates and enables more flexible, non-linear modeling
of treatment effects, potentially capturing complex relationships that a
polynomial-based approach may overlook. While the PLR model provides some
additional flexibility, the IRM model allows for fully heterogeneous treatment
effects, offering a nuanced perspective on the Mita's impact across regions and
district characteristics. My findings suggest that the Mita's economic legacy
is more substantial and spatially heterogeneous than originally estimated. The
IRM results reveal that proximity to Potosi and other district-specific factors
intensify the Mita's adverse impact, suggesting a deeper persistence of
regional economic inequality. These findings underscore that machine learning
addresses the realistic non-linearity present in complex, real-world systems.
By modeling hypothetical counterfactuals more accurately, DML enhances my
ability to estimate the true causal impact of historical interventions.

Motivation: 研究动态分布结构的量化分析，特别是在金融资产（如债券和股票）中，以更好地理解风险暴露和因子载荷的时间变化。

Method: 采用三步筛估计程序，通过单指标投影非参数化建模因子载荷函数，兼顾简约性和统计效率。

Result: 在模拟和实证研究中，QCF模型表现出较高的准确性，优于基准分位数Fama-French五因子模型和分位数潜在因子模型，尤其是在尾部（τ=0.05, 0.95）。

Conclusion: QCF模型为动态分布结构分析提供了高效工具，揭示了由债券和股票波动性、息票和利差等特征驱动的状态依赖风险暴露，并对潜在因子提供了经济解释。

Abstract: We propose a characteristics-augmented quantile factor (QCF) model, where
unknown factor loading functions are linked to a large set of observed
individual-level (e.g., bond- or stock-specific) covariates via a single-index
projection. The single-index specification offers a parsimonious,
interpretable, and statistically efficient way to nonparametrically
characterize the time-varying loadings, while avoiding the curse of
dimensionality in flexible nonparametric models. Using a three-step sieve
estimation procedure, the QCF model demonstrates high in-sample and
out-of-sample accuracy in simulations. We establish asymptotic properties for
estimators of the latent factor, loading functions, and index parameters. In an
empirical study, we analyze the dynamic distributional structure of U.S.
corporate bond returns from 2003 to 2020. Our method outperforms the benchmark
quantile Fama-French five-factor model and quantile latent factor model,
particularly in the tails ($\tau=0.05, 0.95$). The model reveals
state-dependent risk exposures driven by characteristics such as bond and
equity volatility, coupon, and spread. Finally, we provide economic
interpretations of the latent factors.

Motivation: 探讨知识产权规则如何影响跨境贸易，揭示其市场力量和市场扩张的双重效应。

Result: 强IP权利通常促进贸易的广泛边际增长，并将部分活动转向许可和外国投资。

Conclusion: 未来研究需关注无形资产流动和执法质量，以应对数字和数据驱动的国际贸易前沿。

Abstract: Intellectual property (IP) rules have the potential to shape cross-border
trade far more than their legalistic origins might suggest. Drawing on three
decades of evidence, this review shows that stronger IP rights simultaneously
create market-power forces that raise prices and market-expansion forces that
broaden demand, while dynamic incentives spur quality upgrading and new export
varieties. Micro-data and quasi-natural experiments after TRIPS reveal that IP
most often boosts trade along the extensive margin and redirects some activity
toward licensing and foreign investment. Policy bundling and measurement gaps
on the strength of IP rights still cloud causal inference. Future work must map
intangible flows and enforcement quality to capture the digital, data-driven
frontier of international commerce.

= 0.780, p < 0.001), affective (r = 0.772, p < 0.001) and thought (r = 0.797, p
< 0.001) were described as determining factors in tourists' decisions when
visiting Los Uros. In addition, the multiple regression analysis indicated that
experiential marketing explains 83% of the variability in tourism demand. In
conclusion, experiential marketing strategies have a significant impact on
tourism demand. It is recommended that marketing managers of Los Uros Island
implement tactics that promote memorable experiences, prioritizing strategies
that involve experiences that stimulate the thinking and emotions of tourists.

Abstract: Rational information acquisition theory predicts that people select the more
informative information. Thus, people's beliefs will be more persuaded by the
information they select. We test the prediction in a critical real-world
context -- information about COVID-19 vaccines. We conducted an online
experiment in Taiwan where the subjects selected information about COVID-19
vaccines, and then the subjects updated their beliefs about vaccine
effectiveness and references to vaccines. As our design distinguishes different
stages of the rational acquisition framework, it allows us to diagnose the
underlying mechanism of the theory. Our empirical findings demonstrate evidence
that people's information acquisition generally coheres with the rational
theory framework predictions; that is, people choose information when the
information is more likely to alter their decisions. We show that our subjects'
beliefs change more when they see the information they select. We also find
evidence of change in vaccine preferences and choices after they receive the
information they select, which further suggests that the subjects follow the
rational information acquisition framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染可能影响认知表现，尤其在高压环境下（如考试），可能对个人生产力和福祉产生严重后果。

Method: 利用波兰连续三年考试日空气污染的随机变化，结合学校和时间的固定效应，使用政府项目中学校园内每小时空气污染数据进行分析。

Result: PM2.5和PM10浓度每增加一个标准差，学生考试成绩下降约0.07-0.08个标准差，且高能力学生受影响更显著。

Conclusion: 研究表明空气污染对考试成绩有显著负面影响，且影响因污染测量的位置和时间而异，强调了局部污染测量的重要性。

Abstract: Random disturbances such as air pollution may affect cognitive performance,
which, particularly in high-stakes settings, may have severe consequences for
an individual's productivity and well-being. This paper examines the short-term
effects of air pollution on school leaving exam results in Poland. I exploit
random variation in air pollution between the days on which exams are held
across three consecutive school years. I aim to capture this random variation
by including school and time fixed effects. The school-level panel data is
drawn from a governmental program where air pollution is continuously measured
in the schoolyard. This localized hourly air pollution measure is a unique
feature of my study, which increases the precision of the estimated effects. In
addition, using distant and aggregated air pollution measures allows me for the
comparison of the estimates in space and time. The findings suggest that a one
standard deviation increase in the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5
and PM10 decreases students' exam scores by around 0.07-0.08 standard
deviations. The magnitude and significance of these results depend on the
location and timing of the air pollution readings, indicating the importance of
the localized air pollution measure and the distinction between contemporaneous
and lingering effects. Further, air pollution effects gradually increase in
line with the quantiles of the exam score distribution, suggesting that
high-ability students are more affected by the random disturbances caused by
air pollution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决串行独裁（SD）规则可能导致的不可取结果，同时消除合理嫉妒，提出一种在偏好信息不完全时仍能实现公平的机制。

Method: 提出了“可见公平”机制，扩展了SD规则，并提供了策略证明的必要和充分条件。

Result: 研究结果表明，可见公平机制可以满足广泛的分配目标，但会引发信息与效率的新权衡。

Conclusion: 结论是可见公平机制为设计公平且策略证明的规则提供了新思路，但也带来了信息效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Priority-based allocation of individuals to positions are pervasive, and
elimination of justified envy is often, an absolute requirement. This leaves
serial dictatorship (SD) as the only rule that avoids justified envy under
standard direct mechanisms. What if SD outcomes are undesirable from a
designer's perspective? We propose visible fairness, which demands fairness
relative to the (potentially purposefully incomplete) preference information
the mechanism elicits. Visibly fair mechanisms generalize SD; we fully
characterize them and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for
strategy-proofness. We show how to apply these results to design strategy-proof
visibly fair rules that satisfy a broad class of distributional objectives.
Visible fairness, however, results in a new information-efficiency trade-off:
meeting distributional goals leads to the avoidance of eliciation of
information about preferences that could prevent inefficiencies.

### [204] [Asymptotic Equilibrium Analysis of the Boston Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19450)
*Josue Ortega*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 波士顿机制在均衡博弈中的表现分析显示，真实偏好下63%学生被分配到第一志愿，但在纳什均衡中这一比例趋近于零，且存在学生被分配到极差学校的均衡。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究波士顿机制在随机市场中的均衡表现，揭示其潜在问题。

Method: 分析波士顿机制在纳什均衡下的偏好揭示博弈。

Result: 真实偏好下63%学生分配到第一志愿，均衡中比例趋近于零；存在学生被分配到极差学校的均衡。

Conclusion: 波士顿机制在均衡博弈中可能导致学生分配结果显著劣于真实偏好下的表现。

Abstract: We analyze the performance of the Boston mechanism under equilibrium play in
uniform random markets. We provide two results. First, while the share of
students assigned to their first preference is 63% under truthfulness, this
fraction becomes vanishingly small in any Nash equilibrium of the preference
revelation game induced by the Boston mechanism. Second, we show that there is
a Nash equilibrium of the corresponding preference revelation game where the
average student is assigned to a highly undesirable school-dramatically worse
ranked than the logarithmic rank achieved under truthfulness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于统一隐式推理的level-$k$模型和显式推理的认知博弈论，以提供更稳健且理论基础扎实的预测方法。

Method: 方法包括将静态完全信息博弈转化为不完全信息设置，引入向下理性化，并通过最小信念限制分析level-$k$模型和认知层次模型的认知基础。

Result: 研究结果揭示了推理的硬认知边界与对对手类型的信念之间的区别，并为市场设计中的稳健性问题提供了见解。

Conclusion: 结论表明，该方法基于认知博弈论的清晰推理基础，统一了关键的level-$k$模型。

Abstract: Interactive decision-making relies on strategic reasoning. Two prominent
frameworks are (1) models of bounded reasoning, exemplified by level-$k$
models, which keep reasoning implicit, and (2) epistemic game theory, which
makes reasoning explicit. We connect these approaches by "lifting" static
complete-information games into incomplete-information settings where payoff
types reflect players' reasoning depths as in level-$k$ models. We introduce
downward rationalizability, defined via minimal belief restrictions capturing
the basic idea common to level-$k$ models, to provide robust yet well-founded
predictions in games where bounded reasoning matters. We then refine these
belief restrictions to analyze the foundations of two seminal models of bounded
reasoning: the classic level-$k$ model and the cognitive hierarchy model. Our
findings shed light on the distinction between hard cognitive bounds on
reasoning and beliefs about co-players' types. Furthermore, they offer insights
into robustness issues relevant for market design. Thus, our approach unifies
key level-$k$ models building on clear foundations of strategic reasoning
stemming from epistemic game theory.

### [206] [Assessing Risk of Stealing Proprietary Models for Medical Imaging Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19464)
*Ankita Raj,Harsh Swaika,Deepankar Varma,Chetan Arora*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文研究了医疗影像黑盒模型在有限查询预算下对模型窃取攻击的脆弱性，提出了一种名为QueryWise的两步攻击方法，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在医疗影像中应用广泛，但模型窃取攻击对其的威胁尚未充分研究。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出QueryWise方法，利用公开数据集和代理分布的无标签数据，在有限查询预算下高效克隆模型功能。

Result: 在胆囊癌和COVID-19分类任务中验证了QueryWise的有效性。

Conclusion: 医疗影像模型对模型窃取攻击具有显著脆弱性，QueryWise方法在有限预算下表现优异。

Abstract: The success of deep learning in medical imaging applications has led several
companies to deploy proprietary models in diagnostic workflows, offering
monetized services. Even though model weights are hidden to protect the
intellectual property of the service provider, these models are exposed to
model stealing (MS) attacks, where adversaries can clone the model's
functionality by querying it with a proxy dataset and training a thief model on
the acquired predictions. While extensively studied on general vision tasks,
the susceptibility of medical imaging models to MS attacks remains inadequately
explored. This paper investigates the vulnerability of black-box medical
imaging models to MS attacks under realistic conditions where the adversary
lacks access to the victim model's training data and operates with limited
query budgets. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively execute MS
attacks by using publicly available datasets. To further enhance MS
capabilities with limited query budgets, we propose a two-step model stealing
approach termed QueryWise. This method capitalizes on unlabeled data obtained
from a proxy distribution to train the thief model without incurring additional
queries. Evaluation on two medical imaging models for Gallbladder Cancer and
COVID-19 classification substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed attack.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

Existing tools typically aim at managing control flow\ninternally, often at the expense of completeness, while offloading reasoning\nover data flow to SMT solvers. Moreover, reasoning typically happens on source\ncode or intermediate representation level to leverage structural information,\nmaking machine code generation part of the trust base. We are interested in\nchanging the equation in two non-trivial ways: pushing reasoning down to\nmachine code level, and then offloading reasoning entirely into SMT solvers and\nother, possibly more efficient solver technology. In more abstract terms, we\nare asking if bit-precise reasoning technology can be made scalable on\nsoftware, and not just hardware. For this purpose, we developed two tools\ncalled rotor and bitme for model generation and bounded model checking,\nrespectively. We chose RISC-V restricted to integer arithmetic as modeling\ntarget for rotor since RISC-V integer semantics is essentially equivalent to\nestablished SMT semantics over bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors. While\nstate-of-the-art SMT solvers struggle in our experiments, we have evidence that\nthere is potential for improvement. To show the potential, we have slightly\ngeneralized and then implemented in bitme two types of binary decision diagrams\n(BDDs): algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and context-free-language ordered\nbinary decision diagrams (CFLOBDDs). Bitme uses BDDs to propagate program input\nthrough models, essentially generalizing constant propagation to domain\npropagation. SMT solvers only get involved when model input cannot be\npropagated, significanly speeding up SMT solving. We then study the impact on\nstate explosion of CFLOBDDs, which are potentially more scalable than ADDs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u5177rotor\u548cbitme\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6709\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7BDDs\u4f18\u5316SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86rotor\u548cbitme\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5229\u7528BDDs\uff08ADDs\u548cCFLOBDDs\uff09\u4f18\u5316SMT\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u72b6\u6001\u7206\u70b8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46BDDs\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fCFLOBDDs\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u6267\u884c\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0cBDDs\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Since the kernel governs critical system operations and\nenforces isolation boundaries between user space and privileged data, any\nmechanism that modifies its behavior must meet the highest standards of safety\nand correctness. To this end, the eBPF toolchain includes a verifier, which\nstatically checks safety properties such as memory access validity, bounded\nloops, and type correctness before loading the program into the kernel.\nHowever, the existing verifier is both overly conservative in some\ncases-rejecting valid programs-and unsound in others, permitting unsafe\nbehavior that violates the intended semantics of the kernel interface.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce BeePL, a domain-specific language\nfor eBPF with a formally verified type system. The BeePL type system, along\nwith the language design, statically enforces key safety properties such as\ntype-correct memory access, safe pointer usage, absence of unbounded loops, and\nstructured control flow. These guarantees are backed by formal type soundness\nproofs, ensuring that well-typed programs satisfy the safety invariants\nrequired by the eBPF execution environment. BeePL also proves that well-typed\nsource programs meet critical eBPF-specific properties related to memory\nsafety, termination, and control flow, enabling high-level reasoning prior to\ncompilation.

In this\ncontext, various formats of collaborative development workflows using Git have\nemerged and gained popularity among software engineers. We can categorize such\nworkflows into two main types: branch-based workflows and trunk-based\nworkflows. Branch-based workflows typically define a set of remote branches\nwith well-defined objectives, such as feature branches, a branch for feature\nintegration, and a main branch. The goal is to migrate changes from the most\nisolated branch to the main one shared by all as the code matures. In this\ncategory, GitFlow stands out as the most popular example. In contrast,\ntrunk-based workflows have a single remote branch where developers integrate\ntheir changes directly. In this range of options, choosing a workflow that\nmaximizes team productivity while promoting software quality becomes a\nnon-trivial task.

However, most navigation policies are sensitive to\nviewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that\nalter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized\nscenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View\nInvariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the\nrobustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint.

Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the\nWaypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a\nview-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student\nmodel.

In\nthe proposed framework, a set of controlled UAVs cooperatively estimate the\nreal-time 3D position of a target UAV. Here, the active UAV transmits a\nmeasurement signal to the passive UAVs via the reflection from the target UAV.\nEach passive UAV estimates the distance of the active-target-passive UAV link\nand selects an antenna port to share the distance information with the base\nstation (BS) that calculates the real-time position of the target UAV. As the\ntarget UAV is moving due to its task operation, the controlled UAVs must\noptimize their trajectories and select optimal antenna port, aiming to estimate\nthe real-time position of the target UAV. We formulate this problem as an\noptimization problem to minimize the target UAV positioning error via\noptimizing the trajectories of all controlled UAVs and antenna port selection\nof passive UAVs. Here, an attention-based recurrent multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (AR-MARL) scheme is proposed, which enables each controlled UAV to use\nthe local Q function to determine its trajectory and antenna port while\noptimizing the target UAV positioning performance without knowing the\ntrajectories and antenna port selections of other controlled UAVs. Different\nfrom current MARL methods, the proposed method uses a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) that incorporates historical state-action pairs of each controlled UAV,\nand an attention mechanism to analyze the importance of these historical\nstate-action pairs, thus improving the global Q function approximation accuracy\nand the target UAV positioning accuracy. Simulation results show that the\nproposed AR-MARL scheme can reduce the average positioning error by up to 17.5%\nand 58.5% compared to the VD-MARL scheme and the proposed method without FAS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08FAS\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff08UAV\uff09\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08AR-MARL\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5929\u7ebf\u7aef\u53e3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAR-MARL\u65b9\u6848\u6bd4VD-MARL\u548c\u65e0FAS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8617.5%\u548c58.5%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AR-MARL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest\ndevelopments in CBDC system design and implementation. By analyzing 135\nresearch papers published between 2018 and 2025, the study provides an in-depth\nexamination of CBDC design taxonomy and ecosystem frameworks. Grounded in the\nCBDC Design Pyramid, the paper refines and expands key architectural elements\nby thoroughly investigating innovations in ledger technologies, the selection\nof consensus mechanisms, and challenges associated with offline payments and\ndigital wallet integration. Furthermore, it conceptualizes a CBDC ecosystem. A\ndetailed comparative analysis of 26 existing CBDC systems is conducted across\nfour dimensions: system architecture, ledger technology, access model, and\napplication domain. The findings reveal that the most common configuration\nconsists of a two-tier architecture, distributed ledger technology (DLT), and a\ntoken-based access model.

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs.

This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak\nprompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art\nLlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and\n18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts.

The proposed emergency response network\nis a promising solution as it provides a rapidly deployable, resilient\ncommunications infrastructure.

As a bridge\nbetween the disaster management center and the affected areas, it can\nfacilitate the exchange of information in real time, collect data from the\naffected regions, and relay crucial updates to emergency responders. Enhancing\nsituational awareness, coordination between relief agencies, and ensuring\nefficient resource allocation can significantly strengthen disaster response\ncapabilities.

For the three\ndecentralized models, we provide closed-form solutions to compute the optimal\norder quantity of each retailer. For the centralized models, we develop\nclosed-form solutions for the first two models as the transportation cost only\ndepends on either distance or order quantity; but when it depends on both, the\nmodel becomes a non-linear programming problem. We develop a solution algorithm\nnamed Q-search to find a high-quality solution that includes the order quantity\nand the warehouse location.

Models like Stable Diffusion introduce\nunavoidable delays and substantial resource overhead, which are unsuitable for\nusers at the network edge with high QoS demands. Deploying AIGC services on\nedge servers reduces transmission times but often leads to underutilized\nresources and fails to optimally balance inference latency and quality. To\naddress these issues, this paper introduces a QoS-aware\n\\underline{E}dge-collaborative \\underline{A}IGC \\underline{T}ask scheduling\n(EAT) algorithm. Specifically: 1) We segment AIGC tasks and schedule patches to\nvarious edge servers, formulating it as a gang scheduling problem that balances\ninference latency and quality while considering server heterogeneity, such as\ndiffering model distributions and cold start issues. 2) We propose a\nreinforcement learning-based EAT algorithm that uses an attention layer to\nextract load and task queue information from edge servers and employs a\ndiffusion-based policy network for scheduling, efficiently enabling model\nreuse. 3) We develop an AIGC task scheduling system that uses our EAT algorithm\nto divide tasks and distribute them across multiple edge servers for\nprocessing. Experimental results based on our system and large-scale\nsimulations show that our EAT algorithm can reduce inference latency by up to\n56\\% compared to baselines.

To address these challenges, we present FlashANNS, a GPU-accelerated\nout-of-core graph-based ANNS system through I/O-compute overlapping. Our core\ninsight lies in the synchronized orchestration of I/O and computation through\nthree key innovations: 1) Dependency-Relaxed asynchronous pipeline: FlashANNS\ndecouples I/O-computation dependencies to fully overlap between GPU distance\ncalculations and SSD data transfers. 2) Warp-Level concurrent SSD access:\nFlashANNS implements a lock-free I/O stack with warp-level concurrency control,\nto reduce the latency-induced time overhead. 3) Computation-I/O balanced graph\ndegree Selection: FlashANNS selects graph degrees via lightweight\ncompute-to-I/O ratio sampling, ensuring optimal balance between computational\nload and storage access latency across different I/O bandwidth configurations.\nWe implement FlashANNS and compare it with state-of-the-art out-of-core ANNS\nsystems (SPANN, DiskANN) and a GPU-accelerated out-of-core ANNS system\n(FusionANNS). Experimental results demonstrate that at $\\geq$95\\% recall@10\naccuracy, our method achieves 2.3-5.9$\\times$ higher throughput compared to\nexisting SOTA methods with a single SSD, and further attains 2.7-12.2$\\times$\nthroughput improvement in multi-SSD configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashANNS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aGPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684ANNS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7I/O\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u53e0\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u78c1\u76d8ANNS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u78c1\u76d8ANNS\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u53e0SSD\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u53caI/O\u6808\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "FlashANNS\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u8d56\u677e\u6563\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u7ba1\u9053\u3001Warp\u7ea7\u5e76\u53d1SSD\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97-I/O\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u56fe\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u4e09\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0I/O\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u540c\u6b65\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlashANNS\u5728\u5355SSD\u548c\u591aSSD\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b02.3-5.9\u500d\u548c2.7-12.2\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashANNS\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316I/O\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ANNS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The effectiveness of continuous batching relies\non an accurate estimate of the memory requirements of requests.

Consequently, they\nsuffer from harmful request evictions or prolonged queuing times, failing to\nachieve satisfactory throughput under strict Service Level Agreement (SLA)\nguarantees (a.k.a. goodput), across various LLM application scenarios with\ndiffering input-output length distributions.

OpenCAMS is designed to support\nadvanced research in transportation safety, mobility, and cybersecurity by\ncombining the strengths of each simulation domain. Specifically, SUMO provides\nlarge-scale, microscopic traffic modeling; CARLA offers high-fidelity 3D\nperception, vehicle dynamics, and control simulation; and OMNeT++ enables\nmodular, event-driven network communication, such as cellular\nvehicle-to-everything (C-V2X). OpenCAMS employs a time-synchronized,\nbidirectional coupling architecture that ensures coherent simulation\nprogression across traffic, perception, and communication domains while\npreserving modularity and reproducibility. For example, CARLA can simulate and\nrender a subset of vehicles that require detailed sensor emulation and control\nlogic; SUMO orchestrates network-wide traffic flow, vehicle routing, and\ntraffic signal management; and OMNeT++ dynamically maps communication nodes to\nboth mobile entities (e.g., vehicles) and static entities (e.g., roadside\nunits) to enable C-V2X communication. While these three simulators form the\nfoundational core of OpenCAMS, the platform is designed to be expandable and\nfuture-proof, allowing additional simulators to be integrated on top of this\ncore without requiring fundamental changes to the system architecture. The\nOpenCAMS platform is fully open-source and publicly available through its\nGitHub repository https://github.com/minhaj6/carla-sumo-omnetpp-cosim,\nproviding the research community with an accessible, flexible, and\ncollaborative environment for advancing next-generation intelligent\ntransportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenCAMS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86SUMO\u3001CARLA\u548cOMNeT++\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5404\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8026\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6574\u5408SUMO\uff08\u4ea4\u901a\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u3001CARLA\uff083D\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u548cOMNeT++\uff08\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301C-V2X\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "OpenCAMS\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

We define two equilibrium concepts:\nreasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal\nprompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning\nequilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized\nmodels over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded\nrationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation.

Specifically, DPM\nprogressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary\nLoRA module during inference to effectively \"memorize\" the contextual\ninformation.

We explore several popular\narchitectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner\nis aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future\nframes (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat\neach spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that\ncan condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely\npresent in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.\nBuilding on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that\ninjects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one\nstep, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and\nunperturbed predictive distributions.

Current\nmethods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when\nfacing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from\nreactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based\nreinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as\nisolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of\nsynthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions\nbased on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than\nresponding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model\nenvironment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated\naction sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term\ndynamics.

Contention-based systems suffer badly in terms\nof latency when multiple devices compete for the same resources. Coordinated\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (Co-OFDMA) is proposed for Wi-Fi\n8 to remedy this, as it enables multiple Access Points (APs) to share spectrum\nmore efficiently. However, fine-grained resource allocation, namely within\n20MHz bandwidth, is argued to be impractical due to the over-the-air scheduling\noverhead and complexity in terms of physical layer signaling. A wired backhaul\nmitigates the need for over-the-air scheduling and synchronization, and it\nallows for coordination even if APs are not in each others' range.

To\ninvestigate this hypothesis, we propose PointSD, a framework that leverages the\nSD model for 3D self-supervised learning. By replacing the SD model's text\nencoder with a 3D encoder, we train a point-to-image diffusion model that\nallows point clouds to guide the denoising of rendered noisy images. With the\ntrained point-to-image diffusion model, we use noise-free images as the input\nand point clouds as the condition to extract SD features. Next, we train a 3D\nbackbone by aligning its features with these SD features, thereby facilitating\ndirect semantic learning.

It\nis critical for the quality assurance of gaming software. Manual playtesting is\ntime-consuming and expensive. However, automating this process is challenging,\nas playtesting typically requires domain knowledge and problem-solving skills\nthat most conventional testing tools lack. Recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence (AI) have opened up new possibilities for applying Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to playtesting. However, significant challenges remain: current\nLLMs cannot visually perceive game environments, and most existing research\nfocuses on text-based games or games with robust APIs. Many non-text games lack\nAPIs to provide textual descriptions of game states, making it almost\nimpossible to naively apply LLMs for playtesting. This paper introduces Lap,\nour novel approach to LLM-based Automatic Playtesting, which uses ChatGPT to\ntest match-3 games, a category of games where players match three or more\nidentical tiles in a row or column to earn points. Lap encompasses three key\nphases: processing of game environments, prompting-based action generation, and\naction execution. Given a match-3 game, Lap takes a snapshot of the game board\nand converts it to a numeric matrix. It then prompts the ChatGPT-O1-mini API to\nsuggest moves based on that matrix and tentatively applies the suggested moves\nto earn points and trigger changes in the game board. It repeats the\nabove-mentioned three steps iteratively until timeout.

However, few studies have examined\ntheir impact on communication, also due to scattered availability of material.\nHere, we present a novel database of Metaphors of Climate Change in Images\n(MetaClimage) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15861012, paired with literal\nimages and enriched with human ratings. For each image, we collected values of\ndifficulty, efficacy, artistic quality, and emotional arousal from human\nrating, as well as number of tags generated by participants to summarize the\nmessage. Semantic and emotion variables were further derived from the tags via\nNatural Language Processing. Visual metaphors were rated as more difficult to\nunderstand, yet more aesthetically pleasant than literal images, but did not\ndiffer in efficacy and arousal. The latter for visual metaphors, however, was\nhigher in participants with higher Need For Cognition. Furthermore, visual\nmetaphors received more tags, often referring to entities not depicted in the\nimage, and elicited words with more positive valence and greater dominance than\nliteral images. These results evidence the greater cognitive load of visual\nmetaphors, which nevertheless might induce positive effects such as deeper\ncognitive elaboration and abstraction compared to literal stimuli. Furthermore,\nwhile they are not deemed as more effective and arousing, visual metaphors seem\nto generate superior aesthetic appreciation and a more positively valenced\nexperience.

In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset\nfeaturing high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive\ntextual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,\naccompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per\ndescription (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips\npreserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,\nfacilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also\nimprove upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,\nMoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better\nexploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single\ngenerative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance\non both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks.

While tokenization has revolutionized\nimage and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a\ncritical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose\n$I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method\ndecouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The\nintra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to\nhierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The\ninter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across\ntimesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while\nretaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only\nGPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and\npredicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene\ngeneration. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens,\nensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that\n$I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing\nmethods by 25.1\\% in mIoU and 36.9\\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while\nexhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of\ntraining memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

However, there are challenges in both tools and processes that give\nrise to misalignments and frustrations. Recent research seeks to address this\nby automating code review entirely, but we believe that this risks losing the\nmajority of the interpersonal benefits such as knowledge transfer and shared\nownership.\n  We believe that by better understanding the cognitive processes involved in\ncode review, it would be possible to improve tool support, with out without AI,\nand make code review both more efficient, more enjoyable, while increasing or\nmaintaining all of its benefits. In this paper, we conduct an ethnographic\nthink-aloud study involving 10 participants and 34 code reviews. We build a\ncognitive model of code review bottom up through thematic, statistical,\ntemporal, and sequential analysis of the transcribed material. Through the\ndata, the similarities between the cognitive process in code review and\ndecision-making processes, especially recognition-primed decision-making,\nbecome apparent.\n  The result is the Code Review as Decision-Making (CRDM) model that shows how\nthe developers move through two phases during the code review; first an\norientation phase to establish context and rationale and then an analytical\nphase to understand, assess, and plan the rest of the review. Throughout the\nprocess several decisions must be taken, on writing comments, finding more\ninformation, voting, running the code locally, verifying continuous integration\nresults, etc.\n  Analysis software and process-coded data publicly available at:\nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15758266", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\uff08CRDM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u79cd\u5fd7\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u4eba\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u79cd\u5fd7\u7684\"\u6709\u58f0\u601d\u8003\"\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca10\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c34\u6b21\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CRDM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\uff1a\u5bfc\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "CRDM\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4eba\u9645\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6240\u6709\u6743\u3002"}}

Empirical Insights from Large Code Models", "comment": null, "summary": "The growing scale of large language models (LLMs) not only demands extensive\ncomputational resources but also raises environmental concerns due to their\nincreasing carbon footprint. Model quantization emerges as an effective\napproach that can reduce the resource demands of LLMs by decreasing parameter\nprecision without substantially affecting performance (e.g., 16 bit to 4 bit).\nWhile recent studies have established quantization as a promising approach for\noptimizing large code models (LCMs), a specialized subset of LLMs tailored for\nautomated software engineering, their findings offer only limited insights into\nits practical implications. Specifically, current investigations focus only on\nthe functional correctness of the code generated by quantized models,\nneglecting how quantization impacts critical aspects of code quality such as\nreliability, maintainability, and security. To bridge this gap, our study\ninvestigates the effects of quantization on the qualitative aspects of\nautomatically generated code.

While pool-based\nprompting methods have demonstrated success in traditional incremental\nlearning, their effectiveness in FSCIL settings remains unexplored. This paper\npresents the first study of current prompt pool methods in FSCIL tasks,\nrevealing an unanticipated performance degradation in incremental sessions.\nThrough comprehensive analysis, we identify that this phenomenon stems from\ntoken-dimension saturation: with limited data, excessive prompts compete for\ntask-relevant information, leading to model overfitting. Based on this finding,\nwe propose LGSP-Prompt (Local-Global Spatial Prompting), which innovatively\nshifts pool-based prompt learning from the token dimension to the spatial\ndimension. LGSP-Prompt generates spatial prompts by synergistically combining\nlocal spatial features and global frequency-domain representations to highlight\nkey patterns in input images.

This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term\ndecay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in\nLVLMs, on multimodal alignment.

A critical challenge\nis verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference\nanswers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.\nRule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based\nverifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM\njudges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building\nbetter verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'\nperformance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable\ndevelopment of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address\nthis, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for\nsystematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions\ncovering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is\nequipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the\nevaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a\nmultidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental\nframework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized\nverifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.\ncomplete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers\nfundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve\nleading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show\nstronger inclusivity but unstable precision.

In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm\ngeneration dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic\ntext, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation\nframework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive\nlearning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of\nsarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor\noutputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation\nquality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate\nViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including\nlarge language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.\nFurthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual\nIncongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP.

For rare anomaly categories that appear on the road,\n3D detection models trained on closed sets often misdetect or fail to detect\nanomaly objects. To address this risk, it is necessary to enhance the\ngeneralization ability of 3D detection models for targets of arbitrary shapes\nand to possess the capability to filter out anomalies. The generalization of 3D\ndetection is limited by two factors: the coupled training of 2D and 3D, and the\ninsufficient diversity in the scale distribution of training samples. This\npaper proposes a Stereo-based 3D Anomaly object Detection (S3AD) algorithm,\nwhich decouples the training strategy of 3D and 2D to release the\ngeneralization ability for arbitrary 3D foreground detection, and proposes an\nanomaly scoring algorithm based on foreground confidence prediction, achieving\ntarget-level anomaly scoring. In order to further verify and enhance the\ngeneralization of anomaly detection, we use a 3D rendering method to synthesize\ntwo augmented reality binocular stereo 3D detection datasets which named\nKITTI-AR.

Our method employs spherical\ndiscrete sampling based on the weights of the pre-trained models, effectively\nmitigating distortions while achieving favorable initial training values.\nAdditionally, we apply the proposed sampling method to panoramic image\nsegmentation, utilizing features obtained from the spherical model as masks for\nspecific channel attentions, which yields commendable results on commonly used\nindoor datasets, Stanford2D3D.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7403\u5f62\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5931\u771f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5931\u771f\u548c\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7403\u5f62\u79bb\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stanford2D3D\u5ba4\u5185\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7403\u5f62\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This representation\nsupports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by\nenabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term\ntracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are\navailable to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However,\nreal-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate\ncausally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in\nstreaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based\non past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes\nessential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets,\noffer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack\ntemporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines\nto enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term\npoint tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially\nwithout access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating\nthe suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they\ncan serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines.\nHowever, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design\nis still required.

Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,\nbipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,\nto a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this\nhas not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it\nbeing a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications\nwhere gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and\npropose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which\nare the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths.

Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a\n1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research\nreports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks\nmiss.\n  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual\nbge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and\n+0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing\nother models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in\ngeneral STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer\nKorean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of\ntokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings.

Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt.

However, existing methods still face\nchallenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among\nsimilar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft\npositive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft\nnegative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching\nuncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the\nneighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training\nbatches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge.\nThis paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning\nframework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified\nrepresentation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning,\neffectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework\nintroduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive\naggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic\nunderstanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and\ninter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships\namong sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic\ninteractions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum\ncontrastive learning to expand the negative sample set.

In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe\nrecommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and\ndietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional\nguidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the\nSwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer\nuser-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by\ncomparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers.

In\nthis paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only\nleverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the\ncross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge\ndistillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our\nmethod on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and\nCEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current\nState-of-the-Art methods.

FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient.

However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically\nprioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy\nclinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically\nmotivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task\naccuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA)\nperformance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice\nquestions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework\ntrained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot\ngeneralization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for\nscalable calibration without the associated computational costs.

Using a mixed methods approach, we derive a taxonomy of\n32 tasks, 10 content types, and 11 purposes associated with GenAI usage based\non 284 qualitatively coded mentions. We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them.

We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser\nsampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for\npredicting a 2D location and orientation angle.

This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,\nwhere large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream\ntasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of\ntask adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,\ndue to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational\nmodels is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational\nimmunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our\nwork focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of\npriors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on\nnon-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML).

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge.

We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative\nevaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeLaCo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5316\u7684LLM\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6298\u53e0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u9762\u4e34\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "method": "GeLaCo\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u79cd\u7fa4\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acb\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cGeLaCo\u901a\u8fc7\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GeLaCo\u4e3aLLM\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As an\nalternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect\nmultimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously\ndetermining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video\nplayback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce\nProactiveBench, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's\nability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated\nat varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts\nfor the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate\nevaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive\nbenchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveBench and a user study of\nhuman preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human\npreferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider\nthe textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides\na more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction\nscenarios.

A common solution to this\nproblem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but\nthis introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and\noften degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative\nsettings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based\nfeature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and\nstudent models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any\nnew parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components\ncontribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies\nthe most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their\nactivations to the student.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content.

To address this, we revisit the model-based paradigm of\nRobust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and propose Dynamic RPCA Network\n(DRPCA-Net), a novel deep unfolding network that integrates the sparsity-aware\nprior into a learnable architecture. Unlike conventional deep unfolding methods\nthat rely on static, globally learned parameters, DRPCA-Net introduces a\ndynamic unfolding mechanism via a lightweight hypernetwork. This design enables\nthe model to adaptively generate iteration-wise parameters conditioned on the\ninput scene, thereby enhancing its robustness and generalization across diverse\nbackgrounds. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Residual Group (DRG) module to\nbetter capture contextual variations within the background, leading to more\naccurate low-rank estimation and improved separation of small targets.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public infrared datasets demonstrate that\nDRPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in\ndetection accuracy.

Our\nfindings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki\neffect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance\nacross both models lacks the expected associations.

However,\nmost text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to\nexploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the\nall-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the\nspectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),\na novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR\nimages into a unified embedding space.

Various deep learning\napproaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have\nbeen developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).\nHowever, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and\nmonocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its\nconversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of\nprompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract\nestimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a\nframework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for\nabsolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution\nShuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and\nhigh-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program\n(NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived\nDEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM\nestimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x\nresolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of\nmagnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust\ngeneralization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with\n< 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological\nanalysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We\ndemonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S.\nand Israel.

While numerous studies have explored various\naccuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain.\nFirst, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and\ncompares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g.,\npruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs.\nplug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g.,\nViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain\neffective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are\nincreasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these\ngaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token\ncompression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard\nand compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token\ncompression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often\nunderperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only\nprovide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on\nadapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks\nfor edge AI and AI agent applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eViT\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u65e8\u5728\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u7d27\u51d1\u578bViT\u7684\u6548\u679c\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u578bViT\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u538b\u7f29\u5bf9\u901a\u7528ViT\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7d27\u51d1\u578bViT\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u548cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u7d27\u51d1\u578bTransformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

VSD proves that vanilla score distillation can\nbe improved by introducing an extra score-based model, which characterizes the\ndistribution of images rendered from 3D models, to correct the distillation\ngradient. Despite the theoretical foundations, VSD, in practice, is likely to\nsuffer from slow and sometimes ill-posed convergence. In this paper, we perform\nan in-depth investigation of the interplay between the introduced score model\nand the 3D model, and find that there exists a mismatching problem between LoRA\nand 3D distributions in practical implementation. We can simply adjust their\noptimization order to improve the generation quality. By doing so, the score\nmodel looks ahead to the current 3D state and hence yields more reasonable\ncorrections. Nevertheless, naive lookahead VSD may suffer from unstable\ntraining in practice due to the potential over-fitting. To address this, we\npropose to use a linearized variant of the model for score distillation, giving\nrise to the Linearized Lookahead Variational Score Distillation ($L^2$-VSD).\n$L^2$-VSD can be realized efficiently with forward-mode autodiff\nfunctionalities of existing deep learning libraries.

However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery.

While\ntraditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate\ncardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored\nin this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\npoint tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.\nAlthough these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general\nvideos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain\nlimited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode\nultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different\nviews is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we\nrefine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations\nto reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through\nimpartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging\nmulti-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced\nspatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning\nwith our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their\nbaselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker\nboosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error\nby 61.5% across heart cycle phases.

This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and\nthen predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively\npreserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by\nhigh-resolution data.

It\ncontains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3\noceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess\necological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop\na semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine\nbiologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.\nCoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for\nstudying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By\nevaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and\nopportunities.

In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system.

Despite its significance, progress in the field has been\nhindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,\nwhich is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.\nDue to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal\nimages has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of\nanomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of\ngeneralization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.\nFurthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly\nfocus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),\noverlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that\nare commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce\na benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and\nsystematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and\nbenchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach\nleveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the\nbest performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when\nencountering certain unseen anomalies.

Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation.

Emotional\nexpression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human\npsychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial\nhidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and\ninterviews.

Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of\nethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the\nemotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective\nof manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate\nthe level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.\nWe construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically\nannotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation.

Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant\nmodality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the\ncross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to\neach modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient\nback-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces\nit with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient\nback-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This\nhelps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.\nFinally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and\nframeworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of the proposed DGL.

However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems.

Although existing methods\nintroduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality\nreference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,\nmainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a\nRefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating\nmasks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle\nconsistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask.

We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation\ndata and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex\nagricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference\ndata requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first\nnational-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering\n~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural\nland use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission\nerrors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union\n(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field\ndelineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture\nfragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global\nland cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural\nfrontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in\nMozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16\nha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial\nresolution (0.05{\\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of\naccessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation\nreflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder\nfarms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.\nOur results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to\nsocio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food\nproduction, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their\ntrade-offs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u83ab\u6851\u6bd4\u514b\u5168\u56fd2100\u4e07\u4e2a\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe93%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u519c\u7530\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u79d1\u5b66\u653f\u7b56\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u519c\u6237\u519c\u4e1a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u519c\u7530\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u54081.5\u7c73\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u56fd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u83ab\u6851\u6bd4\u514b2023\u5e742100\u4e07\u4e2a\u519c\u7530\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738793%\uff0c\u519c\u7530\u89c4\u6a21\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e3a0.16\u516c\u9877\uff0c83%\u5c0f\u4e8e0.5\u516c\u9877\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u519c\u7530\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u68ee\u6797\u8986\u76d6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u519c\u7530\u89c4\u6a21\u662f\u519c\u4e1a\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u7cae\u98df\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u751f\u8ba1\u3001\u68ee\u6797\u780d\u4f10\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, training\nhigh-compression-rate VQ-VAEs remains computationally demanding, often\nnecessitating thousands of GPU hours. This work demonstrates that a pre-trained\nVAE can be efficiently transformed into a VQ-VAE by controlling quantization\nnoise within the VAE's tolerance threshold. We present\n\\textbf{Quantize-then-Rectify (ReVQ)}, a framework leveraging pre-trained VAEs\nto enable rapid VQ-VAE training with minimal computational overhead. By\nintegrating \\textbf{channel multi-group quantization} to enlarge codebook\ncapacity and a \\textbf{post rectifier} to mitigate quantization errors, ReVQ\ncompresses ImageNet images into at most 512 tokens while sustaining competitive\nreconstruction quality (rFID = 1.06). Significantly, ReVQ reduces training\ncosts by over two orders of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art approaches:\nReVQ finishes full training on a single NVIDIA 4090 in approximately 22 hours,\nwhereas comparable methods require 4.5 days on 32 A100 GPUs.

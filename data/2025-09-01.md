### [1] [Fuzzy, Symbolic, and Contextual: Enhancing LLM Instruction via Cognitive Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21204)
*Vanessa Figueiredo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了架构归纳偏置如何影响大语言模型在指导性对话中的认知行为，通过引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式来促进结构化推理，实验表明完整系统优于基线变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的架构归纳偏置对其在苏格拉底式辅导中认知行为的影响，探索如何通过架构设计来塑造模型的教学策略。

Method: 引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的控制消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准和基于LLM的评估框架进行系统比较。

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最优，移除记忆或符号结构会降低关键认知行为（抽象、自适应探测和概念连续性）的表现。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文评估了GraphRAG在阿尔茨海默病领域的应用效果，通过构建专业知识库和专家问题集，比较了GraphRAG与标准GPT-4o在回答质量和可追溯性方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学研究中的应用受到幻觉、领域知识不足和缺乏可追溯性等问题的限制。GraphRAG通过整合领域特定上下文信息来提高可靠性，但在生物医学等知识密集型领域的评估研究有限。

Method: 收集50篇论文和70个专家问题构建阿尔茨海默病知识库，使用GPT-4o作为LLM，比较GraphRAG系统与标准GPT-4o的回答质量和可追溯性。

Result: 研究评估了两种流行GraphRAG系统的性能，提供了质量对比结果和可追溯性分析。

Conclusion: 研究为研究人员提供了易于使用的界面和预构建的阿尔茨海默病数据库，用于测试标准RAG和GraphRAG的性能，推动了知识密集型领域中可靠AI助手的开发。

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

### [4] [Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)
*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam,Dongjie Wang,Zijun Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO是一个基于大语言模型的医学本体集成学习框架，通过双轴知识传播（垂直和水平）来增强医学概念表示学习，在有限数据和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一本体系统或多个孤立本体系统的知识整合，缺乏跨本体系统的统一学习结构，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系，忽略了跨本体连接。

Method: 1) 使用LLM提供图检索增强的初始化嵌入；2) 通过双轴知识传播联合学习：垂直传播（层级内）和水平传播（跨本体）；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验验证了LINKO相对于最先进基线的优越性能，在有限数据可用性和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出增强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架成功整合了多个本体系统的知识，通过双轴传播机制显著提升了医学概念表示学习效果，特别是在数据稀缺和罕见病预测场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

*Yi Liao,Yu Gu,Yuan Sui,Zining Zhu,Yifan Lu,Guohua Tang,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TiG框架通过将强化学习决策重新表述为语言建模任务，让大语言模型通过游戏环境交互发展程序性知识，同时保持推理和解释能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但在简单交互任务中表现不佳，这凸显了陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的关键差距

Method: TiG将基于强化学习的决策重新表述为语言建模任务：LLMs生成语言指导的策略，通过在线强化学习基于环境反馈进行迭代优化

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统RL方法相竞争的性能

Conclusion: TiG不仅提高了在复杂交互任务中的性能，还通过逐步自然语言解释大大提高了决策的透明度和可解释性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

### [6] [AHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21376)
*Tony Lee,Haoqin Tu,Chi Heem Wong,Zijun Wang,Siwei Yang,Yifan Mai,Yuyin Zhou,Cihang Xie,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集来全面评估10个重要方面，包括感知、推理、公平性等，并标准化了评估流程。测试了14个模型，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在多个方面表现最佳但存在公平性问题，基线系统表现也相当不错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个能力，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要方面。不同评估使用不同的提示方法和推理参数，导致模型间难以比较。

Method: 引入AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括两个新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，在10个重要方面全面评估音频-语言模型性能。

Result: 测试了14个开源和闭源API模型以及3个基线系统。Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第5。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面、标准化的音频-语言模型评估框架，揭示了当前模型的优势和不足，特别是公平性问题。该基准将持续更新，旨在促进音频-语言模型的健康发展。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry.
Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the
economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the
internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI
development.

TL;DR: 本文从认知视角研究知识管理中的遗忘操作，在Spohn排序函数的认知状态下提出了五种通用类型的认知遗忘和七种具体遗忘操作，并通过逻辑编程和AGM理论的后设条件进行系统评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑，如变量消除和AGM收缩，但缺乏在更丰富语义结构的认知状态下的系统研究。本文旨在从认知角度探索遗忘操作，建立与命题逻辑的清晰联系。

Method: 采用认知状态建模，提出五种通用认知遗忘类型，并在Spohn排序函数上实例化七种具体遗忘操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论的后设条件，构建丰富的公理体系来评估遗忘操作。

Result: 系统评估了所有具体遗忘操作对各个公理的满足情况，提供了全面的比较分析，突出了不同遗忘算子之间的差异和共性。

Conclusion: 研究为认知状态下的遗忘操作提供了系统框架，将经典遗忘操作提升到认知层面，为知识管理中的选择性遗忘提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

### [10] [Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)
*Niklas Jansen,Jonas Gösgens,Hector Geffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从状态-动作轨迹中学习STRIPS+模型的新方法SYNTH，用于解决滑动拼图等问题的模型学习，其中状态和动作信息不完整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型学习方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有域谓词都可观察，但现实场景中状态和动作信息往往不完整，需要更"现实"的学习设置。

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，允许某些动作参数在前提条件中隐式存在；提出SYNTH算法，通过构建分层的前提条件表达式序列来学习STRIPS+模型。

Result: SYNTH算法被证明具有正确性和完备性，并在从现有STRIPS域派生的STRIPS+模型生成的状态-动作轨迹上测试了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理状态和动作信息不完整的现实学习场景，为从部分观察数据中学习动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态搜索基准，包含311个需要深度视觉理解和迭代搜索的任务，旨在评估多模态语言模型作为网页代理的真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准往往可以通过浅层固定工作流程解决，无法真正测试模型的细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用能力。

Method: 采用时空外推方法构建任务，要求从空间线索（微文本、局部外观、布局）和时间痕迹（广播覆盖、季节背景）推断出图像外的事实。提供模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具进行评估。

Result: 最强代理（o3）无搜索准确率15.1%，有搜索达到36.0%；开源模型Qwen-2.5-VL-72B无搜索准确率0.0%，20轮搜索后达到6.9%。错误分析显示模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面存在失败。

Conclusion: MMSearch-Plus基准有效揭示了当前多模态语言模型在真实网页代理任务中的局限性，特别是在细粒度视觉推理和长时程搜索规划方面的不足。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于模糊Z数的智慧推理计算框架，将智慧量化为包含置信度的双属性表示，通过道德困境任务验证了其有效性和区分效度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智慧测量依赖自我报告，无法捕捉智慧固有的不确定性和谦逊特质。需要开发能够同时考虑多维度和置信度的计算框架来改进心理学测量并实现人性化AI。

Method: 使用模糊推理系统和Z数（包含智慧分数和置信度分数），通过文化中立的图画道德困境任务收集100名参与者的口语反应，映射到5个智慧成分，使用21条规则和基于高斯核密度估计的隶属函数进行整合。

Result: 概念验证研究表明，系统产生的双属性智慧表示与现有量表存在显著但适度的相关性，与无关特质关系可忽略，支持了聚合效度和区分效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维、不确定性感知的构念，通过Z数操作化，不仅推进了心理学测量，还为AI系统提供了可解释、置信度敏感的推理能力，在严格计算和类人判断之间找到了安全中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实场景的新颖解释范式，用于自动规划领域。相比传统的反事实解释仅关注最小化修改现有计划，该方法通过最小化修改规划问题本身来满足不同的目标属性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的反事实解释在自动规划中只关注修改现有计划来满足不同目标，但无法捕捉问题的高层特性。需要一种能够解释规划问题本身特性的方法。

Method: 提出基于反事实场景的解释范式：给定规划问题P和LTLf公式ψ定义的计划属性要求，寻找对P的最小修改，使其能够产生满足ψ的计划。提出了两种基于显式量化满足ψ计划的定性实例化方法。

Result: 分析了生成此类反事实场景的计算复杂度，证明在不同类型的修改允许下，生成反事实场景的计算成本通常与计算P的一个计划相当，表明方法的实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建该领域的实用算法提供了基础，反事实场景解释比传统方法更能揭示规划问题的本质特性，且计算上可行。

been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

*Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez,Kaile Chen,Fernando Seoane,Farhad Abtahi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个集成多LLM的框架，通过自动化流程挖掘分析和报告生成，简化了医疗流程挖掘应用的技术复杂性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决流程挖掘在医疗领域应用的技术复杂性、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍

Method: 开发了一个集成Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库的GenAI框架，整合多个大型语言模型进行自动化流程图解释和报告生成

Result: 使用脓毒症进展数据验证框架，5个LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动解释，为将复杂流程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用的可操作见解提供了新颖的方法学进展

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

Motivation: 许多高层次多智能体规划问题（如多机器人导航）可以用确定性动作和观察有效建模，但现有Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效处理大规模问题

Method: 基于经典联合均衡搜索策略框架，提出了迭代确定性POMDP规划（IDPP）方法，专门针对确定性转移和观察条件进行优化

Result: IDPP方法能够处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法高效解决的大规模Det-Dec-POMDP问题

Conclusion: Det-Dec-POMDPs为确定性多智能体规划问题提供了有效建模框架，IDPP方法为这类大规模问题提供了实用的求解方案

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Conclusion: 未来将集成私有LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络，以增强可解释性、适应性和实时决策能力

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文提出了A-MHA*算法，将多启发式A*（MHA*）扩展为随时算法，能够快速找到可行解并持续改进直到时间耗尽


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数加速搜索，但只能一次性求解且需要仔细设置膨胀因子，无法随时间持续改进解的质量

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了随时版本的多启发式A*算法

Result: A-MHA*在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域表现出色，相比MHA*和其他随时算法具有更好的性能

Conclusion: A-MHA*保持了原有的次优性和完备性保证，同时增强了MHA*的随时搜索能力，能够快速找到可行解并持续优化

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将AI偏见视为缺陷需要消除，但人类推理本身就包含教育、文化、经验塑造的偏见，这些偏见可能是不可避免且有价值的

Method: 开发MEDLEY概念框架，协调30多个大型语言模型，保留共识和少数观点，将模型特定偏见记录为优势，幻觉视为临床医生验证的临时假设

Result: 概念验证演示器在合成病例中成功保留了共识和少数观点，使诊断不确定性和潜在偏见对临床监督透明化

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，为开发可信医疗AI系统开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径，在临床医生监督下增强医疗推理

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

TL;DR: PosterForest是一个无需训练的科学海报生成框架，通过层次化中间表示和多智能体协作，实现文本与视觉元素的语义整合和结构优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要同时解决这两个挑战。

Method: 引入Poster Tree层次化中间表示，采用多智能体协作策略，内容摘要和布局规划智能体迭代协调并提供相互反馈。

Result: 在多个学术领域的实验中，该方法在定性和定量评估上均优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计水平。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现逻辑一致性、内容保真度和视觉连贯性的联合优化，在信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好方面表现优异。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于旅行商问题的变分量子算法，通过紧凑的排列编码减少量子比特需求，并采用优化-冻结-重用策略，在训练实例上优化电路拓扑后冻结并重用于新实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅行商问题的量子算法需要减少量子比特需求和计算成本，特别是在NISQ硬件上实现时，需要降低结构搜索的开销。

Method: 使用紧凑的排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略：首先通过模拟退火优化训练实例的电路拓扑，然后冻结该拓扑并重用于新实例，仅快速重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市案例达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示了方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等问题规模上表现出强大的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz可以显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，有望扩展到车辆路径和作业车间调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件，为复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解时间变量间的因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整的因果结构未知时。专家通常能够提供摘要因果图来捕捉主要因果关系，但如何利用这种高层抽象来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论支持。

Method: 提出了在给定摘要因果图背景知识的情况下，保证时间变量间微观层面边可定向性的条件。假设可以获得相对于真实未知图的忠实且因果充分的分布。

Result: 研究结果为微观层面的边定向提供了理论保证，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下也适用。这些发现为利用摘要因果图指导复杂时间系统中的因果发现提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了将专家知识融入观测时间序列数据因果推理中的价值，为利用高层因果抽象指导微观因果发现提供了理论基础和方法支持。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

### [23] [Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)
*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索和利用，在非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构的实际场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于预训练扩散模型的规划方法在凸可微奖励场景下表现良好，但在实际非凸、不可微约束和多奖励结构的复杂场景中效果显著下降。同时，有监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时的灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: TDP将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹以促进广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号。

Result: 在三个不同任务（迷宫金币收集、机械臂方块操作、AntMaze多目标探索）上评估，TDP在所有任务上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过树引导的扩散规划有效解决了梯度引导的局限性，能够在复杂现实场景中实现更好的规划性能，同时保持零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 提出基于多智能体系统的临床诊断方法，通过模拟医疗团队会诊模式，动态分配专家智能体进行分层迭代辩论，在识别心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症方面比单智能体基线表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙述的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一大语言模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的鲁棒性，需要更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计协作式多智能体系统，模拟临床会诊团队。Manager智能体协调动态分配的专家智能体团队，通过分层迭代辩论达成共识，仅分析SOAP笔记中的主观和客观部分来识别临床问题。

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III笔记数据集上评估，动态多智能体配置在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和败血症方面表现持续优于单智能体基线。定性分析显示该结构能有效呈现和权衡冲突证据。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、鲁棒和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径，尽管偶尔可能受到群体思维影响。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的伪相关性，利用这些非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差。需要一种方法来同时处理多种偏见并增强分布外鲁棒性。

Method: 提出CoBA（CounterBias Augmentation）框架：1）将文本分解为主语-谓语-宾语三元组；2）选择性修改这些三元组以破坏伪相关性；3）从调整后的三元组重构文本生成反偏见数据。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CoBA不仅提高了下游任务性能，还有效减少了偏见并增强了分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对伪相关性带来的挑战，为提升模型公平性和泛化能力提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Motivation: 现有毒性言论数据集缺乏人口统计背景信息，限制了我们对不同年龄群体在线交流方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共媒体合作，收集Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的匿名评论，结合预定义毒性关键词筛选，采用人工标注和LLM标注相结合的方式，共标注30,048条评论

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年轻用户偏好表达性语言，年长用户更常参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

enterprise-scale dense retrieval applications. Building upon our
first-generation release, these models deliver substantial improvements,
including 16x expanded context length (8,192 tokens), state-of-the-art

TL;DR: TrInk是一个基于Transformer的笔迹生成模型，通过引入缩放位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码来改善文本与笔画的对齐，在IAM-OnDB数据集上相比之前方法显著降低了字符错误率和词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的笔迹生成方法在捕捉全局依赖关系和文本-笔画对齐方面存在不足，需要开发能够更好处理这些问题的模型。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的TrInk模型，在交叉注意力模块中引入缩放位置嵌入和高斯记忆掩码来改善对齐，并设计了主客观评估流程来全面评估生成笔迹的可读性和风格一致性。

Result: 在IAM-OnDB数据集上，TrInk相比之前方法实现了35.56%的字符错误率降低和29.66%的词错误率降低。

Conclusion: TrInk模型通过Transformer架构和创新的注意力机制改进，在笔迹生成任务上取得了显著性能提升，证明了其在捕捉全局依赖和改善文本-笔画对齐方面的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the
cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective
evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate
(CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset
compared to previous methods. We provide an demo page with handwriting samples

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，与人类类似，推理模型能减轻该效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在现实应用中的认知偏见，特别是锚定效应对价格谈判可靠性的影响，以促进LLMs的安全负责任应用。

Method: 指令卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，使用客观和主观指标评估谈判，并分析推理和人格因素与锚定效应的关系。

Result: LLMs像人类一样受锚定效应影响，推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应），但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLMs认知偏见的理解，为LLMs在社会中的安全负责任应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基本视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注MLLMs在复杂任务上的表现，但缺乏对基本视觉感知能力的系统评估，需要构建专门数据集来测试模型的基础感知能力

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进MLLMs和LRMs上进行测试

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在基础感知任务上表现不佳，随着问题复杂度增加，性能显著下降，不同模型在不同认知技能上表现出相似的趋势

Conclusion: MLLMs在复杂任务上表现出色，但在基础视觉感知方面存在明显缺陷，需要进一步改进模型的底层感知能力

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在显著标签偏见：Claude标签总是提高评分，Gemini标签总是降低评分，虚假标签经常导致排名反转，评分差异可达50个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被用于评估输出，需要研究其判断是否受到模型标签偏见的影响，以确保评估的公平性。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种虚假标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和三个质量维度（连贯性、信息性、简洁性）的百分比评分来进行自评估和交叉评估。

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数，与内容无关。虚假标签经常反转排名，偏好投票差异达50个百分点，质量评分差异达12个百分点。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲审或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择信息增益最大的问题，在多轮对话中主动收集信息，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或外部来源收集信息，而不是简单地依赖直接提示。

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题；使用基于LLM信念分布的概率模型；设计了专门的EIG估计器、非仅依赖上下文更新的条件策略，以及候选查询的针对性策略。

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，BED-LLM相比直接提示和其他自适应设计策略取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了一个原则性的框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互，通过智能的信息收集策略大幅提升任务性能。

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要更高效自动化解决方案来预防航空事故

Method: 使用回约学习与GRPO算法微调Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术

Result: 模型性能显著提升，准确匹配度提高350%（从0.04到0.18），部分匹配度达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5-flash

Conclusion: 领域优化的小型模型能够提供更高效、计算成本更低的安全分析方案，适合资源受限边缘设备部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动导致的拼写攻击，性能大幅下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题

Method: 用基于像素的表示替换基于文本的嵌入，将单词渲染为单个图像，提供对噪声输入的更强鲁棒性，并扩展到跨不同书写系统的多语言文本兼容性

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中评估，证明了该方法对拼写噪声的韧性以及在多语言设置中的有效性

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成语言模型能有效解决文本模型的拼写攻击脆弱性问题，提供更好的鲁棒性和多语言兼容性

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现这些模型在音位习得方面没有明显的关键期效应证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键期效应指第二语言习得难度随接触时间延迟而增加，第一语言保持能力随接触时间延长而增强。虽然先前研究在文本语言模型中探讨过这一现象，但在语音模型中的表现尚未充分研究，而口语在人类语言习得中具有核心地位。

Method: 使用儿童导向语音训练不同L2训练开始时间和L1训练结束时间的自监督语音模型，并评估其音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型没有表现出明显的音位习得关键期效应。延迟L2接触开始的模型在L2上表现更好，延迟L1接触结束会导致L1遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型在音位层面没有复制人类语言习得中的关键期效应模式，这表明当前模型与人类语言学习机制存在重要差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Result: 实验显示DMP实现高达3倍加速，且AUROC性能不受影响

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，可扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

TL;DR: 本文通过"正常性"概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是正常/平均而非卓越的人类智能，需要机器表现出类似普通人的不完美行为。同时指出图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个法官评判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考图灵测试的理论基础，探讨人工智能是否应该模拟普通人类智能而非卓越智能，以及图灵测试在认知科学中的意义。

Method: 通过概念分析和哲学论证，重新解读图灵测试中的"平均人类询问者"概念，将其理解为多个法官判断的统计聚合。

Result: 提出大型语言模型如ChatGPT针对的是卓越智能而非普通智能，因此难以通过真正的图灵测试，它们应被称为"人工聪明"而非"人工智能"。

Conclusion: 图灵测试能否促进对人类认知的理解，取决于人类心智是否可简化为正常/平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身，质疑了其所依赖的正常主义范式概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

*Tanguy Herserant,Vincent Guigue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现文本摘要自动评估存在可复现性问题，传统ROUGE指标与新兴LLM评估方法在文献报告性能与实际复现结果间存在显著差异，揭示了评估精度与计算成本间的结构性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对自动文本摘要评估中存在的可复现性挑战，特别是文献报告性能与实际实验结果之间的不一致问题，需要建立一个公平透明的评估框架来系统比较不同评估指标。

Method: 开发统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上测试六种代表性指标（包括经典ROUGE和新兴LLM方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex），进行系统性对比实验。

Result: 发现评估指标存在结构性权衡：与人类判断最一致的指标往往计算密集且跨运行稳定性较差；LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖性和有限可复现性等关键问题。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立更鲁棒的评估协议，包括详尽文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动评审生成器在检测研究逻辑缺陷方面表现不佳，即使论文存在明显逻辑错误，生成的评审内容也不会显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地被用作全自动评审生成器，需要了解其在检测研究逻辑缺陷这一核心评审能力上的具体表现和局限性，以评估其对科学完整性的潜在风险。

Method: 开发了一个完全自动化的反事实评估框架，在受控条件下测试各种ARG方法检测研究逻辑一致性的能力。

Result: 研究发现，与预期相反，研究逻辑中的缺陷对LLMs生成的评审输出没有显著影响，表明现有ARG方法在检测逻辑错误方面存在严重不足。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提出了三个可操作的建议，并公开了反事实数据集和评估框架，为未来改进自动评审系统提供基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估医疗奖励模型和评判器的基准Med-RewardBench，包含1026个专家标注的多模态医疗案例，覆盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个临床关键维度上评估32个先进MLLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗多模态大语言模型在疾病诊断和临床决策中具有重要应用潜力，但需要高度准确、上下文敏感且专业对齐的响应，而现有的基准主要关注通用能力或模型作为求解器的评估，缺乏专门的医疗奖励模型评估基准。

Method: 开发了Med-RewardBench基准，采用三步严格流程构建高质量评估数据集，包含多模态医疗案例，并在六个临床关键维度上进行专家标注。评估了32个最先进的MLLM模型，包括开源、专有和医疗专用模型。

Result: 评估结果显示现有模型在输出与专家判断对齐方面面临重大挑战。开发的基线模型通过微调显示出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医疗奖励模型评估的空白，为医疗MLLM的可靠评估提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型在医疗专业对齐方面的不足，并展示了微调改进的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦连续语义表示模型(DCSRM)，将词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入来识别可解释的语义子维度，并通过脑成像验证其神经合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示细粒度语义子维度的新方法。

Method: 使用DCSRM模型将大语言模型中的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个子嵌入编码特定语义信息，然后通过体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出了一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按照不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素，神经相关性支持了这些子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，为理解语言和大脑中意义组织方式提供了新见解，证明了语义维度分解的神经基础。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出"意识形态深度"概念来衡量LLMs内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，通过可操控性测试和稀疏自编码器分析发现不同模型在意识形态深度上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些立场的稳定性和深度尚不清楚，表面层级的响应容易被提示工程操控，需要探究其是否反映连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量开源LLMs的可操控性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征。

Result: 发现可操控性较低的模型具有更独特和抽象的意识形态特征，一个模型可比同规模模型多7.3倍政治特征，对核心政治特征的定向消融能导致深度模型产生一致逻辑推理转变。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的可量化属性，可操控性可作为窥探其潜在政治架构的重要窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过RLAIF框架，使用AI奖励策略提升小型语言模型的创意写作能力，特别是中文祝福生成。两种方法都有效，但原则引导的LLM作为判官方法效果更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算成本高，而小型模型的传统微调方法在创造性方面表现不佳，RLHF成本过高，需要找到更可扩展的创造性强化方案。

Method: 采用RLAIF框架：1）多代理拒绝采样训练的奖励模型；2）通过对抗训练和反思机制优化的原则引导LLM作为判官直接提供奖励信号。

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创造性输出，但原则引导的LLM作为判官方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面更优。自动评估与人类判断强一致。

Conclusion: 原则引导的LLM作为判官方法为创造性小型语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，在保持高质量的同时减少了对人工标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次聚类的自动分类器选择方法，通过优先考虑多样性来改进集成学习在假新闻检测中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成学习方法在假新闻检测中性能严重依赖分类器的多样性，但选择真正多样化的模型仍然是一个关键挑战，因为模型倾向于学习冗余模式

Method: 首先计算分类器之间的成对多样性，应用层次聚类将其组织成不同粒度级别的组，然后通过HierarchySelect从每个层次级别选择一个分类器池，每个池代表不同的内部多样性，最后选择最多样化的池进行集成构建

Result: 在6个数据集中的2个上实现了最高准确率，优于Elbow启发式方法和现有最先进基线

Conclusion: 该方法通过优先考虑多样性并扩展性能指标，有效提升了集成学习在假新闻检测中的效果，为解决分类器选择挑战提供了新思路

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Abstract: We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS)
dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT
model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset
consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity
scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is
uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5
range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the
MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other
alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments
demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity
tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations,

Abstract: The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information
across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect
privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for
diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive
overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization
techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered
on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of
Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers

evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical
toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review
consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择和数据合成方法存在静态数据集管理的局限性，无法适应模型能力的动态演化，需要建立闭环优化系统

Method: 三轴模型信号诊断（损失模式、嵌入聚类动态、自对齐分数）+自适应优化引擎+动态学习原则的闭环优化

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升7.15%的准确率，同时保持原始数据集规模

Conclusion: 建立了通过数据和模型动态人机协同进化的可持续LLM训练新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Conclusion: 人格基础的分析能够揭示传统评估方法忽略的大语言模型差异，对于个性化人机协作有重要意义。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance

LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化、公开可用的数据集。

Method: 构建了Misviz真实数据集和Misviz-synth合成数据集，使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行综合评估。

Result: 任务仍然极具挑战性，现有模型在检测误导性可视化图表方面表现有限。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz和Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为检测误导性可视化图表和减少错误信息传播提供了重要资源，但该领域仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在多任务场景下存在跷跷板现象，某些任务性能提升以其他任务性能下降为代价，需要解决任务干扰和遗忘问题

Method: 1) 独立微调每个任务识别核心参数区域；2) 基于区域重叠度对任务分组；3) 核心参数直接移植，非核心参数通过SLERP平滑融合；4) 轻量级流水线SFT训练，冻结先前任务核心区域

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过参数隔离和融合策略有效解决了多任务微调中的核心挑战，为LLM下游任务适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

*Diane Tchuindjo,Omar Khattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了推理密集型回归(RiR)任务，针对需要从文本中推断细微数值属性的问题，并开发了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，在基准测试中取得了65%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究越来越多地将大语言模型应用于推理密集型回归任务，这类任务需要从文本中进行深度分析来推断数值属性，但现有的提示冻结LLM和微调Transformer编码器方法在此类任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化（通过分析批量数据来优化提示）和神经集成学习（整合多个模型的预测），该方法简单轻量且不需要大量任务特定训练数据。

Result: 在三个现实问题构建的RiR基准测试中，MENTAT方法相比提示冻结LLMs和微调Transformer编码器两种基线方法，取得了最高65%的性能改进。

Conclusion: MENTAT方法在推理密集型回归任务上表现显著优于现有方法，但该领域仍有很大的改进空间，需要未来的进一步研究发展。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

TL;DR: PiCSAR是一种无需训练的方法，通过联合对数似然对推理链和最终答案进行评分，在best-of-n采样中显著提升模型性能，使用更少样本实现更好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理任务中设计评分函数的挑战，即在没有真实答案的情况下识别正确的推理链。

Method: 提出Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR)，使用推理和最终答案的联合对数似然来评分候选生成，自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度。

Result: 在多个基准测试上取得显著提升（MATH500 +10.18，AIME2025 +9.81），在20次比较中16次以至少2倍更少的样本超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，验证了PiCSAR方法的有效性。

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common
Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models.
However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data
quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data
quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples
due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for
indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based
pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages),
achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2
seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical
tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

Motivation: 开发自动化的牙齿状况分类系统，为牙科诊断提供计算机辅助支持，提高诊断效率和准确性

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：定制CNN、CNN特征提取与传统分类器混合模型、微调预训练架构，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型准确率最高（85.4%），优于定制CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射挑战

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：1) Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射；2) Key-Value重排增强特征对应；3) 使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化保持语义一致性

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，显著提升了零样本外观迁移的性能

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERTACache是一个针对扩散模型的缓存加速框架，通过分析缓存误差的两个主要来源（特征偏移误差和步长放大误差），采用离线残差分析和动态调整策略，在保持生成质量的同时实现2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销巨大。虽然特征缓存可以加速推理，但简单的缓存重用会导致明显的质量下降。需要系统分析缓存误差的来源并设计有效的补偿机制。

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：1）离线残差分析识别可重用步骤；2）通过轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分间隔；3）使用闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差；4）联合校正两种误差类型。

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中，ERTACache实现高达2倍推理加速，同时保持甚至提升视觉质量。在Wan2.1视频扩散模型上，2倍加速的同时VBench指标退化最小，有效保持基线保真度。

Conclusion: ERTACache通过系统分析缓存误差机制并设计相应的校正策略，成功解决了扩散模型缓存加速中的质量退化问题，为高效推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询来改善视频大语言模型的时间语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型因为帧采样稀疏和训练监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义。人类自然会通过拖动进度条来筛选显著的时间段落，但现有模型缺乏这种能力。

Method: 提出TVS方法：(1)保留关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询保持答案一致性，(3)维持答案不变性。这是个模块化的前端适配器任务，可集成到训练和推理流程中。

Result: 实验结果显示，结合TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%提升，在推理阶段获得34.6%提升。提出的ReSimplifyIt基线模型在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提高了0.47的F-1分数。

Conclusion: TVS方法通过时间信息筛选有效改善了视频-语言理解能力，优化了理解负担和认知负荷的分配，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Result: 观察到使用姿态标注进行手术工具定位可以获得高质量的结果。

Conclusion: 骨骼姿态标注是手术工具定位的有效方法，发布的数据集和软件将促进该标注方式的广泛采用。

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

TL;DR: Safe-Control是一种即插即用的安全补丁，通过数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，在锁定T2I模型中注入安全控制信号，有效减少不安全内容生成，同时保持良性图像质量和文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I生成模型安全机制存在局限性，外部或内部防御要么在分布偏移下容易被规避，要么需要大量模型特定调整，需要一种更有效的安全解决方案。

Method: 使用数据驱动策略和安全感知条件，以补丁方式向锁定的T2I模型注入安全控制信号，支持构建多种安全补丁并灵活合并为统一补丁，具有即插即用设计。

Result: 在6个不同T2I模型上评估显示，Safe-Control将不安全内容生成概率降至7%，相比基线方法的约20%有显著提升，同时在良性图像上保持质量和文本对齐。

Conclusion: Safe-Control是一种有效的即插即用安全补丁方案，显著优于现有最先进的安全机制，能够灵活适应不同安全需求并兼容类似去噪架构的T2I模型。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model
developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can
address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms,
whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

Conclusion: GENNAV系统在处理复杂目标区域识别任务方面表现出色，特别是在stuff-type目标、多目标和无目标场景中具有显著优势，并在真实世界环境中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM模型对所有问题都采用逐步思维过程，但对于简单问题这种思维过程是冗余的，导致计算效率低下

Method: 采用双模式退火训练，结合双模式策略优化(BPO)，让模型同时具备思维和非思维两种能力，并通过改进的GRPO框架进行训练

Result: 在25个挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，在多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大的16B模型性能相当但计算成本更低

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思维机制有效平衡了模型性能和计算效率，为多模态大语言模型的实用化提供了新思路

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合3D重建和配准，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的挑战，特别是在噪声X射线下的椎体区域处理方面表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模标注的3D建筑数据集，自动生成准确且语义丰富的3D建筑模型面临重大挑战。受计算机视觉中合成数据成功的启发，需要创建大规模合成数据集来推动该领域发展。

Method: 创建SYNBUILD-3D数据集，包含三种模态：LoD 4级别的语义增强3D线框图、对应的平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中推导，包含房间、门窗信息。

Result: 成功构建了包含超过620万个合成3D住宅建筑的大规模数据集，提供多模态表示和丰富的语义标注，数据集和代码样本已公开可用。

Conclusion: SYNBUILD-3D数据集为开发新颖的生成式AI算法提供了基础，能够自动化创建LoD 4级别的3D建筑模型，同时保持语义-几何一致性，推动3D建筑建模领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法来同时估计单应性变换和径向畸变，解决了三种不同配置的径向畸变问题，并构建了快速、稳定、准确的最小求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实图像处理中，相机镜头引起的几何畸变（特别是径向畸变）会影响单应性估计的准确性。传统方法分别处理三种不同的径向畸变配置，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的统一方法，能够同时处理三种径向畸变配置：（i）仅一个图像有畸变，（ii）两个图像有相同畸变，（iii）两个图像有独立畸变。基于该方法构建了新的最小求解器。

Result: 在包括鱼眼相机图像在内的标准基准测试中，所提出的求解器在保持相似精度的同时，比现有最先进求解器更快。

Conclusion: 该方法为径向畸变单应性估计提供了一个统一的框架，所开发的求解器在速度和精度方面都表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量(GCAV)框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决了跨层概念不一致性问题，提高了概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念激活向量(CAVs)在不同层独立计算时存在不一致性，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的方法来确保概念表示的语义一致性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐跨层概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的CAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来应用TCAV到GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV框架通过整合跨层信息，提供了对深度学习模型如何编码人类定义概念的更全面和可解释的理解，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个无需参数调整的视觉上下文提示框架，通过结合LLM和视觉基础模型，使模型能够仅使用少量上下文示例就能泛化到未见过的物体类别，在ReID任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个特定领域训练模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少标注需求，但难以捕捉身份敏感特征。

Method: 提出VICP框架：使用LLM从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，通过任务特定提示指导视觉基础模型（如DINO）提取身份判别特征，利用动态视觉提示实现跨类别泛化。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个ReID基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的表现明显优于基线方法，无需数据集特定的重新训练。

Conclusion: VICP通过LLM和视觉基础模型的协同工作，实现了对未见物体类别的有效泛化，为少样本物体重识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

TL;DR: 使用SegResNet模型在PANTHER挑战赛的两个MRI胰腺肿瘤分割任务中表现一般，Task 1 DSC为0.56，Task 2 DSC为0.33，显示小数据集下MRI序列差异带来的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤的精确分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但由于解剖变异性和数据集有限，自动化分割仍面临挑战

Method: 采用Auto3DSeg架构中的SegResNet模型，使用5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成方法，在解剖相关感兴趣区域进行训练

Result: Task 1（T1加权MRI）DSC 0.56，Task 2（T2加权MR-Linac）DSC 0.33，性能差异显著

Conclusion: 结果显示了小数据集MRI胰腺肿瘤分割的挑战性，但证明了自动化分割的潜力，需要更大标准化数据集来提高模型鲁棒性和临床实用性

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reverse Imaging是一种基于物理原理的心脏MRI数据增强方法，通过反演求解底层自旋属性来解决不同成像序列间的泛化问题，显著提升分割模型的跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的心脏MRI分割模型在不同成像序列间泛化能力差，主要原因是图像对比度的显著差异，但这些差异都源于相同的底层自旋物理属性。

Method: 提出Reverse Imaging方法：1）从观测图像反演求解底层自旋属性（质子密度、T1、T2值）；2）通过扩散模型学习自旋属性的先验分布；3）利用反演得到的自旋属性合成任意新序列的图像。

Result: 该方法能够从MRI图像中获得有意义的自旋属性估计，实现高度灵活的图像合成，使分割模型在完全不同图像对比度和成像协议下都能实现高精度分割。

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强和域适应方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力。

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

TL;DR: PHD是一种新颖的个性化3D人体网格恢复方法，通过用户特定形状信息来提高视频姿态估计精度，使用点扩散变换器作为形状条件3D姿态先验，显著提升绝对姿态精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性设计，在优化2D对齐时忽略了用户特定身体形状和3D姿态合理性，导致3D精度下降。需要一种能同时考虑个性化形状和3D姿态合理性的方法。

Method: 首先校准用户身体形状，然后基于该形状进行个性化姿态拟合。开发了身体形状条件3D姿态先验（Point Diffusion Transformer），通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Result: 不仅提高了骨盆对齐姿态精度，还显著改善了绝对姿态精度。方法数据高效，仅需合成数据训练，可作为即插即用模块与现有3D姿态估计器集成。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦形状校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，为个性化3D人体姿态恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上，HTP减少训练MACs38.5%、推理MACs56.8%，推理速度提升81.1%，同时达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态剪枝冗余姿势token，在保持关键运动动态的同时显著提升了传播模型的效率

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 2D风格转换模块将二值指纹转为灰度图像；2) 3D结构扩展网络将2D图像外推为3D解剖体积；3) 基于3D GAN的OCT真实感细化器添加纹理和噪声

Result: 生成了42万个合成样本，预训练模型在ZJUT-EIFD基准测试中将EER从15.62%显著降低到2.50%

Conclusion: 该方法有效克服了OCT数据稀缺问题，合成数据质量高，能显著提升指纹识别性能

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

Conclusion: 手术器械分割取得了良好效果，但由于手术器械内在的高度相似性，器械类型识别仍是一个具有挑战性的问题

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于全片形成像（WSI）的索引地图生成框架和基于领域的配置机制，解决WSI元数据缺乏标准化导致的手动选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全片形成像（WSI）缺乏标准化的元数据，在AI算法训练和验证中选择合适的WSI集群主要依靠手动检查，这在包含数百万对象的大规模集合中不可行。

Method: 提出了一种通用框架来生成WSI的2D索引地图，并为特定应用领域提供配置机制。该方法通过三层组织结构（来源、组织类型、病理改变）为每个WSI生成详细的组织地图，以提供细粒度的内容信息。

Result: 在临床病理学领域进行了实践验证，使用通用语法和语义实现了不同目录之间的互操性，并通过WSI目录、机器学习和图基于WSI表示的具体例子展示了该标准的优势和适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的标准化框架能够有效解决WSI元数据缺乏标准的问题，为大规模WSI集群的自动化选择和管理提供了可行的方案，在多个医学领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度伪标签的无监督增量学习方法ICPL，能够在无标注数据集上进行增量学习，性能接近有监督方法，并在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，传统增量学习方法需要完全标注的数据集，这在实践中不现实。需要开发能够从无标注数据中学习新知识的增量学习方法。

Method: 使用置信度伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制确保伪标签质量。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法获得竞争性结果，在最终准确率上超越最先进的class-iNCD方法5%以上。

Conclusion: ICPL方法有效解决了无标注增量学习问题，具有实际应用价值，特别适合资源受限环境，在细粒度数据集上也展示了实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedShift是一个基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges的统一类别条件生成模型，用于在合成和真实X射线图像之间进行高保真跨域转换，无需配对数据或特定领域训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然可扩展，但与真实临床设置存在显著领域差距，限制了其在真实世界中的泛化能力。需要解决合成和真实X射线图像在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表示方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges构建统一的类别条件生成模型。学习共享的领域无关潜在空间，支持训练期间见过的任何领域对之间的无缝转换。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管模型规模比基于扩散的方法小，MedShift仍表现出强大性能，在推理时保持灵活性，可以调整以优先考虑感知保真度或结构一致性。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学成像中的领域适应提供了一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，在X-DigiSkull新数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are
available at https://caetas.github.io/medshift.html

Motivation: 现有全球产品主要关注二元树冠覆盖或冠层高度，无法在个体水平上识别树木，大规模个体树木监测仍受限于建模不足。

Method: 使用深度学习方法，通过高斯核模拟可扩展大小的树冠，从机载激光雷达数据自动提取数十亿个点进行训练，能够识别森林内外的树木。

Result: 与现有树冠覆盖图和机载激光雷达相比达到最先进性能（与航空激光雷达的分数覆盖R²=0.81），在不同生物群落中报告了平衡的检测指标，通过人工标签微调可进一步提高检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为全球高分辨率树木监测提供了一个可扩展的框架，并能适应未来提供改进影像的卫星任务。

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Conclusion: 提出的M框架通过创新的分层结构和优化策略，成功解决了动态3D高斯溅射的训练效率问题，为实时沉浸式应用提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级图像描述模型，参数仅为125M，比LLaMA-7B小56倍，性能却可与大型多模态通用模型相媲美，并开发了Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架来解决视觉盲区问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型计算需求高，难以在本地设备部署，需要开发轻量级但性能相当的图像描述解决方案。

Method: 基于125M参数语言模型构建专家模型，并通过DeepLens提取详细视觉表示，开发Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架增强视觉基础。

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现与大型多模态通用模型相当，但存在视觉盲区问题；新框架有效提升了描述质量。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架成功解决了视觉盲区限制。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide
future method development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术家族或在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽视了结合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 理论证明和实验验证了最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效结合，提出MME评分统一多个最先进OOD检测器为一个更有效的评分函数。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试中，MME在所有基准上都显著优于最新方法，使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上平均FPR95达到27.57%，比现有最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 多方法集成策略能够有效提升OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了迁移性

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗补丁攻击的效果和迁移能力

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个专门针对长视频幻觉的基准ELV-Halluc，系统研究了语义聚合幻觉(SAH)现象，发现SAH随语义复杂度增加而加剧，并提出位置编码策略和DPO训练方法来缓解SAH。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频输入不一致或无关的幻觉内容。先前的研究主要关注短视频幻觉，且将原因简化为语言先验、帧缺失或视觉编码器引入的偏差，但忽略了模型在将帧级语义聚合为事件级语义组时产生的语义聚合幻觉(SAH)。

Method: 1) 构建ELV-Halluc基准，专门针对长视频幻觉；2) 通过实验验证SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的关系；3) 分析模型在快速变化语义上更容易产生SAH；4) 提出位置编码策略和DPO训练方法来缓解SAH；5) 构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集。

Result: 实验证实了SAH的存在，显示SAH随语义复杂度增加而增加；模型在快速变化语义上更容易产生SAH；采用位置编码和DPO策略后，在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比率大幅降低27.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地识别和分析了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了有效的缓解方法，为视频多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了新的研究视角和解决方案。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Method: 训练一个卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样，然后将该上采样器网络直接应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割。

Result: 该方法能够有效分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快的速度产生高质量的分割结果，优于传统的卷积网络训练或微调。

Conclusion: 提出的特征上采样方法为显微镜图像分析提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，特别适用于处理精细特征和大尺寸图像的挑战。

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，无需精确场景划分和严格约束，在检索任务和零样本泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

*Yujin Park,Haejun Chung,Ikbeom Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EZ-Sort方法通过CLIP零样本预排序和不确定性引导的合并排序，将成对比较的标注成本降低了90.5%，相比之前工作减少19.8%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成对比较虽然比绝对评分更可靠，但需要O(n^2)次标注，计算成本过高。现有方法通过主动采样将成本降至O(n log n)，但仍需进一步优化

Method: 1) 使用CLIP模型进行分层零样本预排序；2) 用自动化比较替代简单的人工比较；3) 初始化桶感知Elo分数；4) 运行不确定性引导的人机协同合并排序

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：人脸年龄估计(FGNET)、历史图像时序(DHCI)、视网膜图像质量评估(EyePACS)。当n=100时，相比穷举成对比较减少90.5%标注成本，相比之前工作减少19.8%

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，同时保持或提高了评分者间可靠性

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个从头部和手腕跟踪数据中恢复人-物交互的统一框架，使用扩散Transformer架构联合建模人体姿态、物体运动和接触信息，在头戴式设备场景中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜和手表等可穿戴设备的普及，从第一人称视角建模人-物交互成为一个重要但尚未充分探索的问题。研究旨在探索仅通过头部和手腕跟踪能恢复多少交互信息。

Method: 采用扩散Transformer架构和独特的三变量扩散过程，联合建模人体运动、物体轨迹和接触序列。在头部中心规范空间中操作，增强对全局方向的鲁棒性。提出基于传送带的推理方法，可处理任意长度序列。

Result: 通过广泛评估，ECHO在自我中心人-物交互重建方面超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ECHO首次提出了从最小化观察中统一恢复三种模态的框架，为可穿戴设备场景下的人-物交互建模提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了从单词级到行级OCR的进阶方法，突破了传统单词分割的粘颈，通过利用更大的句子上下文来提高识别准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，而现代单词级OCR将粘颈转移到了单词分割。研究者观察到需要向行级OCR迁移来绝缘单词检测错误并提供更大的语言上下文。

Method: 提出了从单词级到行级OCR的进阶方法，直接将整行图像输入模型，输出字符序列。这种方法绕过了单词检测步骤，利用更大的句子上下文来提高识别准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示端到端准确性提高5.4%，效率提高4倍。研究还创建了包含251个英语页面图像的行级注释数据集。

Conclusion: 行级OCR方法在准确性和效率方面都显著优于单词级方法，并且能够更好地利用大语言模型的进步。这种方法尤其适用于文档图像的识别。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在通用场景上预训练，但它们在城市场景中的细粒度空间推理能力转移效果尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三种模型，在零样本设置下评估性能，并通过城市场景特定的合成VQA数据集进行微调。数据集基于街景图像的分割、深度和物体检测预测构建，每个问题都配有LLM生成的链式思维答案。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了城市场景空间推理作为视觉语言模型的新挑战，并证明了合成数据集构建是将通用模型适配到专业领域的实用路径。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学成像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发育跟踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类/回归任务，限制了细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)，一种统一的生成式轨迹方法，能够学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，并能回退到最近图像预测器作为特殊情况。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和稳健基准。

Conclusion: TFM解决了医学成像中时间动态建模的根本差距，提供了一个强大且灵活的框架，能够处理复杂的4D医学图像预测任务。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Leibovich评分在胆色细胞肾癌复发风险分层中存在病人级分辨率有限且缺少形态学信息的问题，需要更个性化的预测方法。

Method: 使用预训练编码器和Cox生存模型构建模块化深度学习框架，测试单模态、晚期融合和中间融合等不同组合方式，整合预下CT和本后全手手术切片图像。

Result: 在真实世界ccRCC组群中，WSI基础模型表现一致超过CT单模态，中间融合方式进一步提升性能，最佳模型接近调整Leibovich评分。形态学信息通过融合增加了预测价值。

Conclusion: 证明了基础模型基于多模态整合进行个性化ccRCC风险预测的可行性，未来需要探索更表达力强的融合策略、更大多模态数据集和通用CT编码器。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在计算机生成全息术中存在的三个主要问题：端到端网络忽略物理关系、CNN感受野有限、ASM方法局限于有限近场

Method: 采用深度展开网络架构，将梯度下降分解为自适应带宽保持模型(ABPM)和相位域复值去噪器(PCD)，其中PCD使用复值可变形自注意力模块捕获全局特征

Conclusion: 提出的深度展开网络成功解决了CGH中的关键挑战，提供了更好的灵活性、全局特征捕获能力和更宽的工作距离范围

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 解决全身PET/CT医疗图像中电子轨道异质性、生理吸收和多中心变异性导致的治疗医学分割困难，需要人机协同的交互式方法来提高分割效率和准确性。

Method: 扩展nnU-Net模型支持用户点击提示，将前景和背景点击编码为欧几里得距离变换(EDT)输入通道，系统研究不同空间提示表征方法，并提出在线模拟用户交互和自定义点采样策略。

Result: EDT编码方法在跨校验评中表现最佳，比基线模型显著减少了假阳性和假阴性错误，获得最强的继承性能。

Conclusion: 证明了可提示模型在多迷药剂、多中心PET/CT分割中实现高效人机协同工作流的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Method: 基于相机参数的几何映射，通过概率投影机制和置信度分数来细化映射并过滤无关元素，使用时序处理选择性积累可靠信息

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集的新划分上表现出优于最先进方法的性能，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离挑战场景中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影机制通过置信度分数有效提高了HD地图构建的精度和泛化能力，特别是在困难场景中表现突出

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法计算资源需求高、需要大量合成图像的问题，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)进行微调，大幅降低计算需求，可在消费级GPU上运行。

Result: 在7个不同目标检测数据集上验证，仅用500张合成图像训练的检测器性能优于使用5000张合成图像的ODGEN基线，mAP@.50:.95提升达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量和效率优先的方法比暴力生成更有效，仅用10%的数据和少量计算成本就能达到最先进性能，使合成数据生成更加实用和易于获取。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击检测方法需要重新训练、修改网络架构或影响干净输入的性能，需要一种无需模型修改的实时检测方案

Method: 在VGG-16等CNN的早期卷积层并行监测激活熵值，利用对抗性扰动导致的熵值变化特征进行检测

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层激活熵值产生7%的偏移，检测准确率达到90%，假阳性和假阴性率均低于20%

Conclusion: CNN激活熵可单独用于评估模型可靠性，实现实时对抗性输入检测的自诊断视觉系统，且不影响原始模型性能

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

TL;DR: UItron是一个开源的GUI代理基础模型，具有先进的GUI感知、定位和规划能力，通过系统数据工程和交互基础设施显著提升了中文移动应用的自动化操作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理是实现自动化移动/PC设备操作的重要任务，但面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型能力限制等挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调处理各种GUI场景的感知和规划任务，开发课程强化学习框架支持复杂推理和在线环境探索，并建立了连接移动和PC设备的交互环境。

Result: UItron在GUI感知、定位和规划基准测试中表现优异，特别是在中文移动应用场景中取得显著进展，收集了超过100万步操作轨迹。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统性数据工程和交互基础设施的建立，推动了GUI代理向实际应用迈进一步，解决了现有解决方案在中文能力方面的普遍不足。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

*Ha Min Son,Zhe Zhao,Shahbaz Rezaei,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强域感知表示和域不变分类的解耦，来提升CLIP模型在域泛化任务中的性能，特别是在分布外数据上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化评估可能不够挑战性，无法充分测试CLIP在真正未见数据场景下的性能。研究发现CLIP在更分布外的数据集上性能显著下降，需要新的方法来提升域泛化能力。

Method: CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独的域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知表示；2）通过合成生成的多样化域数据；3）鼓励域特征与分类特征解耦来实现域不变分类。

Result: CLIP-DCA在具有挑战性的评估中相比现有方法显示出显著改进，特别是在更分布外的数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 增强域感知是基础模型中实现有效域不变分类的前提条件，CLIP-DCA通过解耦域感知和分类特征的方法成功提升了域泛化性能。

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

*Qiyue Sun,Qiming Huang,Yang Yang,Hongjun Wang,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视频学习过程中引入非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展示出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。论文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型数据（如科幻、动画等）的新视频数据集，将其用于模型训练过程中的表示学习，并在三个关键任务上进行评估：OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别。

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据能一致提升各种设置下的性能。增加非典型样本的类别多样性进一步提升OOD检测性能；在新类别发现任务中，使用更小但语义更多样的非典型样本集比使用更大但更典型的数据集效果更好；在零样本动作识别中，非典型视频的语义多样性帮助模型更好地泛化到未见过的动作类别。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表示学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督视频持续学习(uVCL)方法，通过核密度估计和新颖性检测来处理无标签、无任务边界的视频学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的空间-时间信息，但在无监督持续学习领域研究较少。现有研究依赖标签和任务边界，而标签数据成本高且不实用。

Method: 使用无监督视频Transformer网络提取深度特征，通过核密度估计(KDE)构建非参数概率表示，并使用新颖性检测来动态扩展内存集群。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Something-to-Something V2三个标准视频数据集上进行深度评估，无需任何标签或类别边界。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型在连续学习多个任务时的性能，为无监督视频持续学习领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于nnU-Net框架的多阶段级联预训练策略，用于胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)的MRI自动分割。通过数据增强方案的系统评估和定制化集成策略，在两个分割任务中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌的MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据条件下仍能保持高性能的分割方法。

Method: 采用nnU-Net框架，实施深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案，并构建定制化的异构集成模型。

Result: 在Task 1中实现了最先进的MASD 5.46 mm和HD95 17.33 mm边界精度，交叉验证肿瘤Dice分数达到0.661（Task 1）和0.523（Task 2）。

Conclusion: 该方法为在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专业化高性能模型提供了稳健的方法论，通过度量感知集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学评估中表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5。在真实病例治疗建议生成中，正确性和全面性评分较高，幻觉现象罕见，但仍需专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专门针对肿瘤学优化的GPT-5大语言模型在临床决策支持中的表现，特别是在放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用两个互补基准进行评估：(1) ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试的300道多选题；(2) 60个真实放射肿瘤病例的治疗方案生成，由4名认证放射肿瘤学家评估正确性、全面性和幻觉现象。

Result: GPT-5在TXIT测试中平均准确率92.8%，显著优于GPT-4(78.8%)和GPT-3.5(62.1%)。病例评估中正确性评分3.24/4，全面性评分3.59/4，幻觉罕见。评估者间一致性较低(Fleiss' kappa 0.083)。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但仍有改进空间。虽然幻觉较少，但存在实质性错误，表明GPT-5生成的治疗建议在临床实施前需要严格的专家监督。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间逻辑关系，但在正常数据有限的情况下，逻辑异常检测仍然具有挑战性

Method: 构建三个互补的记忆库：1）类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2）对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3）补丁级记忆库用于结构性异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数

Result: 在涉及工业和医疗领域的七个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过协作式记忆库统一结构性和逻辑性异常检测是有效的，TMUAD框架在多个领域表现出优越性能

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at
https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注，利用大型视觉语言模型处理带真实掩码的视频来突出感兴趣物体，并收集手动标注进行无偏评估。

Conclusion: VoCap模型通过多任务处理和伪标注数据有效解决了视频物体理解的多项挑战，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made
available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/vocap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但忽略了视觉事件识别中固有的语义模糊性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在保持传统top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的MAP改进。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了场景识别中的语义模糊性挑战，为多标签评估建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要开发一个更全面的驾驶知识测试基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉版本(DriveQA-V)，涵盖交通法规和场景的全面测试。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调、环境因素敏感性分析和预训练效果验证。

Result: 1) SOTA模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2) 在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性；3) DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素(光照、视角、距离、天气)的敏感性；4) 预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能。

Conclusion: DriveQA为评估驾驶AI系统提供了全面的基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，同时证明了通过适当的训练方法可以显著提升模型在复杂驾驶场景中的理解和推理能力，对自动驾驶系统的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模增长，因果推断的数据分析工作流变得复杂，非专家在关系数据库中执行工作流会导致重复性瓶颈，阻碍及时的业务洞察

Method: ORCA系统通过自然语言查询解释、数据库表导航、SQL代码生成、数据预处理和因果推断库配置，自动化完整的数据分析流水线

Result: 在基准和合成电商数据集上的实证评估显示，ORCA在表理解、查询生成和因果效应估计方面具有竞争优势，平均处理效应估计比GPT-4o mini提升7倍以上

Conclusion: ORCA系统能够通过人机交互实现因果推断工作流的自动化，降低统计计算的技术门槛，支持稳健的数据驱动决策

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for decision-making science while the
complexity of the data analysis workflow, ranging from data wrangling to causal
analysis, increases substantially as the scale of data grows in complicated
business environments. Especially, the execution of the workflow in relational
databases by non-experts can result in repetitive bottlenecks which impede
timely and responsible business insights. To address this challenge, we propose
ORCA (Orchestrating Causal Agent), an LLM agentic system that can automate
routine workflows in RDBMS while preserving expert oversight via human-AI
interactions. ORCA orchestrates the full data analysis pipeline: interpreting
natural language queries, navigating tables from DB servers, generating proper
SQL codes, preprocessing data, and configuring modeling processes using causal
inference libraries. Domain experts still can control the automation through
iterative interactions with ORCA, enabling robust data-driven decision making
with less technical expertise in statistical computing. Empirical evaluations
on benchmark and synthetic e-commerce datasets demonstrate competitive
performance of ORCA in table understanding, query generation, and cause-effect
estimation -- achieving over $7\times$ improvement in estimating average
treatment compared to GPT-4o mini.

along a Hilbert space-filling curve, and constructs multiple Hilbert trees to
support approximate nearest neighbor search. We submitted implementations to
both Task 1 (approximate search on the PUBMED23 dataset) and Task 2 (k-nearest
neighbor graph construction on the GOOAQ dataset) under the official resource
constraints of 16 GB RAM and 8 CPU cores. The Hilbert forest demonstrated
competitive performance in Task 1 and achieved the fastest construction time in
Task 2 while satisfying the required recall levels. These results highlight the
practical effectiveness of Hilbert order-based indexing under strict memory
limitations.

*Eunjae Jo,Nakyung Lee,Gyuyeong Kim*

TL;DR: Miffie是一个基于大语言模型的数据库自动化规范化框架，通过双模型自优化架构实现高精度的模式规范化，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库规范化对保持数据完整性至关重要，但传统手动方式耗时且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用双模型自优化架构：生成模块消除异常，验证模块提供反馈，循环优化直到满足规范化要求；设计任务特定的零样本提示词以提高准确性和成本效益。

Result: 实验结果表明Miffie能够规范化复杂数据库模式并保持高精度。

Conclusion: Miffie框架成功实现了数据库自动规范化，解决了手动规范化的效率和质量问题，为大语言模型在数据工程领域的应用提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

### [121] [Fast and Scalable Mixed Precision Euclidean Distance Calculations Using GPU Tensor Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21230)
*Brian Curless,Michael Gowanlock*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出FaSTED算法，利用GPU张量核心的FP16-32混合精度计算欧氏距离，相比现有FP64算法获得2.5-51倍加速，精度损失小于0.06%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU张量核心具有高计算吞吐量，但之前研究仅使用FP64精度。利用FP16-32混合精度可以显著提升欧氏距离计算性能，这在数据分析应用中很重要。

Method: 设计FaSTED算法，通过层次化数据重用和最大化各级内存（全局内存、共享内存、寄存器）利用率来实现高计算吞吐量。应用于相似性搜索，采用索引数据结构减少不必要的欧氏距离计算。

Result: 在4个128-960维真实数据集上，混合精度方法比现有FP64算法快2.5-51倍，比两个FP32 CUDA核心算法也更快。与FP64基线相比精度损失小于0.06%。

Conclusion: FaSTED算法成功利用张量核心的FP16-32混合精度能力，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升了欧氏距离计算性能，为数据分析和相似性搜索应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with tensor cores (TCs) that are commonly used for
matrix multiplication in artificial intelligence workloads. However, because
they have high computational throughput, they can lead to significant
performance gains in other algorithms if they can be successfully exploited. We
examine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in
many data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit
floating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower
precision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit
accumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so
high that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor
core Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational
throughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and
maximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and
registers). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which
typically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean
distance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean
distance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two
single precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index. We find
that across four real-world high-dimensional datasets spanning 128-960
dimensions, the mixed-precision brute force approach achieves a speedup over
the SOTA algorithms of 2.5-51x. We also quantify the accuracy loss of our mixed
precision algorithm to be less than <0.06% when compared to the FP64 baseline.

*Changheng Wang,Zhiqing Wei,Lizhe Liu,Qiao Deng,Yingda Wu,Yangyang Niu,Yashan Pang,Zhiyong Feng*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出基于随机游走的去中心化联邦平均算法DFedRW，通过随机游走更新替代多步本地更新，解决了异构数据下的收敛问题，并引入量化版本提升通信效率，在收敛速度和准确率上优于传统FedAvg。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在异构和不平衡数据下存在收敛慢和次优模型问题，中心化范式有单点故障和隐私风险，需要去中心化方案来提升鲁棒性和隐私保护。

Method: 提出DFedRW算法，用随机游走更新替代多步本地更新，允许聚合部分随机游走更新避免掉队者问题，并开发量化版本DFedRW提升通信效率。

Result: 理论证明在凸条件下达到O(1/k^(1-q))收敛上界，数值分析显示在高异构性下测试准确率比(decentralized)FedAvg提升38.3%和37.5%。

Conclusion: DFedRW算法有效解决了联邦学习在异构数据环境下的收敛问题，通过随机游走和量化技术实现了更好的收敛性能和通信效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a communication-efficient distributed machine
learning method that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data. FL can be categorized into centralized and
decentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to
aggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,
communication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the
decentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides
improved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in
leveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this
approach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal
models in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this
challenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),
which replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk
updates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized
versions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data
and introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial
random walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model
update. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a
quantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves
convergence upper bound of order $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex
conditions. Furthermore, we propose a sufficient condition that reveals when
quantization balances communication and convergence. Numerical analysis
indicates that our proposed algorithms outperform (decentralized) FedAvg in
both convergence rate and accuracy, achieving a 38.3\% and 37.5\% increase in
test accuracy under high levels of heterogeneities.

TL;DR: 本文提出CORRECT，一个GitHub Action工具，用于在远程HPC资源上安全执行测试，以解决HPC领域可重复性研究的障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC社区虽然采用激励结构促进可重复研究，但由于HPC基础设施和软件的特殊性以及严格的访问要求，许多论文仍无法满足可重复性要求。

Method: 开发CORRECT GitHub Action工具，支持在远程HPC资源上进行安全测试执行，通过持续集成(CI)和完整的溯源信息来替代资源访问限制。

Result: 在三种不同类型的HPC应用上评估CORRECT的可用性，证明其能够有效自动化和记录可重复性评估。

Conclusion: 更好的HPC兼容CI解决方案（如CORRECT）能够显著改善HPC应用的可重复性，为缺乏资源访问的研究者提供可行的替代方案。

Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive
structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding
badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do
not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software,
coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for
reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular
documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete
provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better
HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We
present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to
reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub
Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC
resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC
applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating
and documenting reproducibility evaluations.

Method: 1) 资源感知的混合架构生成机制创建双区域神经网络；2) 隐私保护的基于环境聚类的联邦学习方法；3) 面向环境的跨架构知识蒸馏机制。

Result: 实验显示比最佳基线收敛速度快21%，在完成时间、能耗和加权成本方面分别提升15.7%、10.8%和13.9%，域数量增加时性能保持能力提升3-5倍。

Conclusion: KD-AFRL框架有效解决了多域IoT应用调度问题，在性能、效率和可扩展性方面都表现出色，为异构云边端环境提供了实用的分布式调度解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications across
heterogeneous Cloud-Edge-IoT environments presents significant challenges in
distributed scheduling optimization. Existing approaches face issues, including
fixed neural network architectures that are incompatible with computational
heterogeneity, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data
distributions across IoT scheduling domains, and insufficient cross-domain
collaboration mechanisms. This paper proposes KD-AFRL, a Knowledge
Distillation-empowered Adaptive Federated Reinforcement Learning framework that
addresses multi-domain IoT application scheduling through three core
innovations. First, we develop a resource-aware hybrid architecture generation
mechanism that creates dual-zone neural networks enabling heterogeneous devices
to participate in collaborative learning while maintaining optimal resource
utilization. Second, we propose a privacy-preserving environment-clustered
federated learning approach that utilizes differential privacy and K-means
clustering to address non-IID challenges and facilitate effective collaboration
among compatible domains. Third, we introduce an environment-oriented
cross-architecture knowledge distillation mechanism that enables efficient
knowledge transfer between heterogeneous models through temperature-regulated
soft targets. Comprehensive experiments with real Cloud-Edge-IoT infrastructure
demonstrate KD-AFRL's effectiveness using diverse IoT applications. Results
show significant improvements over the best baseline, with 21% faster
convergence and 15.7%, 10.8%, and 13.9% performance gains in completion time,
energy consumption, and weighted cost, respectively. Scalability experiments
reveal that KD-AFRL achieves 3-5 times better performance retention compared to
existing solutions as the number of domains increases.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要强大的交易排序机制，并指出了新兴MEV策略对区块链网络的影响，为去中心化生态系统中MEV的演变和挑战提供了全面见解。

Abstract: The evolution of blockchain technology, from its origins as a decentralized
ledger for cryptocurrencies to its broader applications in areas like
decentralized finance (DeFi), has significantly transformed financial
ecosystems while introducing new challenges such as Maximum Extractable Value
(MEV). This paper explores MEV on the Polygon blockchain, with a particular
focus on Atomic Arbitrage (AA) transactions. We establish criteria for
identifying AA transactions and analyze key factors such as searcher behavior,
bidding dynamics, and token usage. Utilizing a dataset spanning 22 months and
covering 23 million blocks, we examine MEV dynamics with a focus on Spam-based
and Auction-based backrunning strategies. Our findings reveal that while
Spam-based transactions are more prevalent, Auction-based transactions
demonstrate greater profitability. Through detailed examples and analysis, we
investigate the interactions between network architecture, transaction
sequencing, and MEV extraction, offering comprehensive insights into the
evolution and challenges of MEV in decentralized ecosystems. These results
emphasize the need for robust transaction ordering mechanisms and highlight the
implications of emerging MEV strategies for blockchain networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练经常因各种故障而中断，需要强大的容错能力。现有的无备份方法（如冗余计算、动态并行和数据重路由）都存在性能损失问题。

Method: Odyssey通过统一的性能模型、快速执行计划搜索、准确性能估计和高效通信优化，在故障发生时智能选择最优恢复策略。

Result: 在32卡集群上的实验显示，Odyssey将恢复后与无故障训练的性能差距控制在11.00%以内，同时保持模型收敛和高效内存使用。相比最先进方法，吞吐量分别提升1.229倍和1.355倍。

Conclusion: Odyssey系统通过自适应故障恢复策略选择，有效解决了大语言模型训练中的容错问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Training large language models faces frequent interruptions due to various
faults, demanding robust fault-tolerance. Existing backup-free methods, such as
redundant computation, dynamic parallelism, and data rerouting, each incur
performance penalties, whether from ongoing overhead, lengthy reconfigurations,
or post-recovery inefficiencies. We propose Odyssey, an adaptive fault-tolerant
system that intelligently selects optimal recovery strategies when a failure
occurs. Odyssey achieves this through a unified performance model, expedient
execution plan search, accurate performance estimation, and efficient
communication optimizations. Experiments on a 32-card cluster show that Odyssey
maintains a performance gap of within 11.00% between post-recovery and
failure-free training, while preserving model convergence and efficient memory
usage. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Odyssey achieves up to 1.229x and
1.355x higher average throughput than Oobleck and Recycle, respectively.

Motivation: 现有MoE模型卸载技术由于I/O瓶颈和稀疏计算问题，硬件利用率较低，需要新的方法来充分利用硬件资源

Method: 采用推测解码技术扩大专家工作负载，通过理论和经验屋顶线分析协调GPU和CPU，开发专用CPU分块注意力验证内核，并集成自动超参数调优器

Result: 实验结果显示，SpecMoEOff相比最先进的MoE卸载技术实现了高达2.5倍的解码吞吐量提升

Conclusion: SpecMoEOff通过推测解码有效解决了MoE模型卸载中的硬件利用率问题，显著提升了推理性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have significantly
increased their parameter scale as well as model performance. Extensive
offloading techniques have been proposed to address the GPU memory limitations
of MoE inference. However, due to the I/O bottleneck and sparse computation of
MoE models, existing offloading techniques still suffer from low hardware
utilization. To fully utilize the hardware resources, we propose SpecMoEOff,
which employs the speculative decoding technique to enlarge the workload of
each expert. SpecMoEOff orchestrates the GPU and CPU by both theoretical and
empirical roofline analysis. In addition, we develop a dedicated CPU chunked
attention verification kernel to fit the speculative decoding in offloading
scenarios as well as minimizing the additional overhead led by draft models.
SpecMoEOff further integrates an optimizer to automatically tune the
hyperparameters of speculative decoding under given hardware and workload.
Experimental results show that SpecMoEOff achieves up to 2.5x decode throughput
improvement over the state-of-the-art MoE offloading techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数字孪生系统的推送-拉取调度器(PPS)框架，用于动态分配通信资源，在正常状态同步和异常报告之间取得平衡，显著降低了信息不准确性的漂移年龄(AoII)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生系统需要与物理系统保持同步，但传统更新机制无法有效平衡正常状态更新和紧急异常报告之间的资源分配，导致系统效率低下。

Method: 设计了推送-拉取调度器(PPS)框架，动态分配通信资源给拉取更新(主动请求传感器数据)和推送更新(传感器主动发送紧急信息)，优化资源使用效率。

Result: 相比现有技术，将信息不准确性的漂移年龄(AoII)降低了20%以上，同时保持相同的异常检测保证，在最坏情况下将异常检测AoII从70ms降至20ms。

Conclusion: PPS框架有效解决了数字孪生系统中正常状态同步和异常报告之间的资源分配问题，显著提升了系统性能和响应速度。

Abstract: A digital twin (DT) contains a set of virtual models of real systems and
processes that are synchronized to their physical counterparts. This enables
experimentation and examination of counterfactuals, simulating the consequences
of decisions in real time. However, the DT accuracy relies on timely updates
that maintain alignment with the real system. We can distinguish between: (i)
pull-updates, which follow a request from the DT to the sensors, to decrease
its drift from the physical state; (ii) push-updates, which are sent directly
by the sensors since they represent urgent information, such as anomalies. In
this work, we devise a push-pull scheduler (PPS) medium access framework, which
dynamically allocates the communication resources used for these two types of
updates. Our scheme strikes a balance in the trade-off between DT alignment in
normal conditions and anomaly reporting, optimizing resource usage and reducing
the drift age of incorrect information (AoII) by over 20% with respect to
state-of-the-art solutions, while maintaining the same anomaly detection
guarantees, as well as reducing the worst-case anomaly detection AoII from 70
ms to 20 ms when considering a 1 ms average drift AoII constraint.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模拟框架缺乏对5G网络中多并发流量流在QoS Flow Identifier级别的高保真建模能力，无法满足智能工厂中设备同时处理多种QoS要求流量的需求。

Method: 扩展Simu5G支持per-QFI建模，并设计新型QoS感知比例公平调度器(QoS-PF)，动态平衡延迟、保证比特率和优先级指标。

Result: 在包含边缘机器视觉、实时控制循环和批量数据传输的智能工厂场景中，QoS-PF提高了截止时间遵守率和公平性，同时不牺牲吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该工作为工业5G部署中高级QoS策略的模拟和分析提供了方法和架构基础，所有扩展都以模块化和开源方式实现以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Private 5G networks are emerging as key enablers for smart factories, where a
single device often handles multiple concurrent traffic flows with distinct
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Existing simulation frameworks, however,
lack the fidelity to model such multi-flow behavior at the QoS Flow Identifier
(QFI) level. This paper addresses this gap by extending Simu5G to support
per-QFI modeling and by introducing a novel QoS-aware Proportional Fairness
(QoS-PF) scheduler. The scheduler dynamically balances delay, Guaranteed Bit
Rate (GBR), and priority metrics to optimize resource allocation across
heterogeneous flows. We evaluate the proposed approach in a realistic smart
factory scenario featuring edge-hosted machine vision, real-time control loops,
and bulk data transfer. Results show that QoS-PF improves deadline adherence
and fairness without compromising throughput. All extensions are implemented in
a modular and open-source manner to support future research. Our work provides
both a methodological and architectural foundation for simulating and analyzing
advanced QoS policies in industrial 5G deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程语言翻译方法需要为每对语言开发单独的翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。为了解决这个问题，需要一种统一的中间表示来实现多语言间的双向翻译。

Method: 使用统一的中间表示CrossGL，包含语言特定的词法分析器/解析器将源代码转换为AST，双向CrossGL翻译模块实现ToCrossGLConverter类用于导入代码和CodeGen类用于目标生成，以及处理完整翻译流程的全面后端实现。

Result: 通过跨编程领域的全面评估，在所有支持的后端上实现了成功的编译和执行，证明了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，支持一次编写、随处部署的开发模式，统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需最少的努力，仅需要语言特定的前端/后端组件。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子软件工程提供了有前景的研究方向，未来可进一步探索将软件系统模型实例作为RAG信息源，以及代码到代码转换等应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

Conclusion: UTR框架能够有效训练LLM生成高质量单元测试，为自动化测试生成提供了新的方法

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个轻量级框架，使用指令调优的大语言模型和LoRA适配器进行bug分配，通过候选约束解码确保有效分配，在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型项目中的bug分配任务通常缓慢且不一致，需要一种更高效的自动化解决方案来替代传统方法。

Method: 使用指令调优的大语言模型（LLM）结合LoRA适配器，采用候选约束解码技术来确保有效的bug分配。

Result: 在EclipseJDT和Mozilla数据集上，模型在短列表质量方面表现强劲（Hit at 10达到0.753），尽管精确Top-1准确率一般。在最新快照上准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: 指令调优的LLMs为昂贵的特征工程和基于图的方法提供了实用的替代方案，展示了在现实世界人机协作bug分配中的潜力。

Abstract: Bug triaging, the task of assigning new issues to developers, is often slow
and inconsistent in large projects. We present a lightweight framework that
instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses
candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on
EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality
(Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent
snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for
real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that
instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature
engineering and graph-based methods.

TL;DR: 简单的观察掩码策略在SWE-agent中比LLM摘要化效果更好，成本更低，解决率相近但成本减半


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别LLM基代理在处理复杂任务时产生的长上下文历史问题，对比简单省略旧观察与LLM摘要化的性能差异

Method: 在SWE-agent上使用SWE-bench Verified数据集，系统比较原始代理、观察掩码和LLM摘要化三种策略，测试五种不同模型配置

Result: 掩码策略将成本降低50%，解决率与摘要化相当或略高（如Qwen3-Coder 480B从53.8%提升到54.8%）

Conclusion: 在SWE-agent环境下，最简单的上下文管理策略即掩码旧观察是最高效和经济的方案

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

TL;DR: LMPA利用大语言模型增强指针分析，通过识别类似系统API的用户自定义函数和改进摘要分析，提高精度和可扩展性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有指针分析框架由于对代码语义理解不足，导致对用户自定义函数的处理过于保守，传播错误信息。大语言模型的发展为解决这一问题提供了新机会。

Method: 提出LMPA框架，集成LLM到指针分析中：1）识别类似系统API的用户自定义函数并进行相应建模；2）推断初始点集；3）引入基于自然语言的增强摘要策略

Result: 该方法能够减少错误的跨调用上下文传播，提高指针分析的精度和可扩展性

Conclusion: LMPA展示了将大语言模型集成到指针分析中的潜力，但实现这一愿景仍面临重要挑战

Abstract: Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing
frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major
limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code,
resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge
this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a
vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and
scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs
and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context
propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring
initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with
natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing
this vision.

Motivation: 现有强化学习策略测试方法生成的测试套件针对特定策略定制，对其他策略的适用性不明确，需要开发可重用的策略无关测试用例选择方法

Method: 使用一组策略基于难度分数从候选池中选择测试用例，采用受质量-多样性算法启发的离散化通用测试用例描述符表面来促进测试套件多样性

Result: 评估了难度分数的有效性，分析了方法效果和成本与策略数量的关系，检验了多样性方法对状态空间的覆盖和触发策略产生错误行为的能力

Conclusion: MPTCS能够选择出揭示智能体行为典型缺陷的多样化、可重用、策略无关的测试用例集合

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential
decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of
the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most
reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to
the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is
unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel
automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract
test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their
solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to
select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal
typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases
from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method,
based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty
score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of
policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test
suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by
quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state
space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.

Motivation: 随着AI代码助手日益融入软件开发工作流，了解其代码与人类编写代码的差异对于确保可靠性、可维护性和安全性至关重要。

Method: 评估超过50万个Python和Java代码样本，使用正交缺陷分类法识别缺陷，采用通用弱点枚举评估安全漏洞。

Result: AI生成代码通常更简单重复，但更容易出现未使用结构和硬编码调试；人类代码结构更复杂但可维护性问题更多；AI代码包含更多高风险安全漏洞。

Conclusion: AI和人类编写的代码具有不同的缺陷特征，需要在AI辅助编程中采用专门的质量保证实践。

Abstract: As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written
programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security.
In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human
developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and
Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security
vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code
samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via
Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common
Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and
more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging,
while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher
concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also
contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the
distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need
for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.

Abstract: The demand for rapid software delivery in the Information Technology (IT)
industry has significantly intensified, emphasising the need for faster
software products and service releases with enhanced features to meet customer
expectations. Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as
Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change
are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution
from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations
teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient
and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically
assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the
feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven
semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners
in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through
thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19
themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically
regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps
practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the
interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met
the research objectives.

*Haotian Deng*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 开发了一个框架来识别当政策同时改变参与激励和结果变量时的处理效应，适用于就业补贴等场景，解决了传统方法无法处理政策诱导进入者的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如Heckman选择方程、LATE、DiD、RDD等）无法有效处理政策同时改变参与决策和结果变量的情况，特别是在政策诱导的边际进入者方面存在识别难题。

Method: 引入了边际加权估计量（marginality-weighted estimands），能够恢复政策诱导进入者的因果效应，为存在内生选择的情境提供政策相关的替代方案。

Result: 该方法能够有效识别政策诱导进入者的因果效应，解决了传统方法在政策同时改变参与激励和结果变量时的识别局限。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为理解公共项目的经济影响提供了新的分析工具，特别适用于劳动经济学、发展经济学和健康经济学等依赖简化形式因果推断的领域。

Abstract: This paper develops a framework for identifying treatment effects when a
policy simultaneously alters both the incentive to participate and the outcome
of interest -- such as hiring decisions and wages in response to employment
subsidies; or working decisions and wages in response to job trainings. This
framework was inspired by my PhD project on a Belgian reform that subsidised
first-time hiring, inducing entry by marginal firms yet meanwhile changing the
wages they pay. Standard methods addressing selection-into-treatment concepts
(like Heckman selection equations and local average treatment effects), or
before-after comparisons (including simple DiD or RDD), cannot isolate effects
at this shifting margin where treatment defines who is observed. I introduce
marginality-weighted estimands that recover causal effects among policy-induced
entrants, offering a policy-relevant alternative in settings with endogenous
selection. This method can thus be applied widely to understanding the economic
impacts of public programmes, especially in fields largely relying on
reduced-form causal inference estimation (e.g. labour economics, development
economics, health economics).

*Gordon Burtch,Robert Moakler,Brett R. Gordon,Poppy Zhang,Shawndra Hill*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文分析了数字平台广告实验工具（Lift测试和A/B测试）的差异，重点揭示了A/B测试中的发散投放问题及其对因果解释的影响，并提出了减少该问题的配置建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字平台为广告主提供实验工具优化广告活动，但A/B测试中广告投放算法可能将不同广告变体投放到不同受众群体，导致结果既反映广告内容效果又反映受众构成变化，使因果解释复杂化。

Method: 研究通过大规模实证分析，比较了3,204个Lift测试和181,890个A/B测试，测量了发散投放现象，并测试了不同广告活动配置对减少发散投放的影响。

Result: Lift测试显示无显著受众不平衡，确认其因果有效性；A/B测试显示明显的受众不平衡。研究表明通过特定配置选择可以减少A/B测试中的发散投放，降低算法对结果的影响。

Conclusion: 虽然无法完全消除A/B测试中的发散投放，但研究提供了基于证据的指导，帮助广告主在A/B测试中获得更可推广的广告内容洞察。A/B测试的发散投放是特定且有意为之的，旨在告知广告主实际广告表现。

Abstract: Many digital platforms offer advertisers experimentation tools like Meta's
Lift and A/B tests to optimize their ad campaigns. Lift tests compare outcomes
between users eligible to see ads versus users in a no-ad control group. In
contrast, A/B tests compare users exposed to alternative ad configurations,
absent any control group. The latter setup raises the prospect of divergent
delivery: ad delivery algorithms may target different ad variants to different
audience segments. This complicates causal interpretation because results may
reflect both ad content effectiveness and changes to audience composition. We
offer three key contributions. First, we make clear that divergent delivery is
specific to A/B tests and intentional, informing advertisers about ad
performance in practice. Second, we measure divergent delivery at scale,
considering 3,204 Lift tests and 181,890 A/B tests. Lift tests show no
meaningful audience imbalance, confirming their causal validity, while A/B
tests show clear imbalance, as expected. Third, we demonstrate that campaign
configuration choices can reduce divergent delivery in A/B tests, lessening
algorithmic influence on results. While no configuration guarantees eliminating
divergent delivery entirely, we offer evidence-based guidance for those seeking
more generalizable insights about ad content in A/B tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然成本驱动的OFDI理论基础已建立，但关于因果机制的实证证据仍然有限，需要研究输入成本冲击如何具体影响企业海外投资决策

Method: 利用中国2017年废纸进口禁令作为外生冲击，采用双重差分策略，使用2000-2023年企业层面数据，分析造纸行业供应链的独特特征

Result: 政策冲击使垂直OFDI概率在政策后时期相对于对照组增加约16%，表明企业通过跨境重新配置生产来应对国内投入冲击

Conclusion: 研究为理解企业在面临投入市场波动时的全球生产决策微观基础做出贡献，强调垂直OFDI是应对供给侧中断的战略响应

Abstract: This paper examines how adverse supply-side shocks in domestic input markets
influence firms' vertical outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) decisions.
While the theoretical basis for cost-driven OFDI is well established, empirical
evidence on the causal mechanisms remains limited. We develop a framework in
which input cost shocks raise unit production costs, but firms undertake
vertical OFDI only when shocks are sufficiently severe or when baseline costs
are already high. Firm heterogeneity leads to a sorting pattern, whereby more
productive firms are more likely to invest abroad. To test this mechanism, we
exploit China's 2017 waste paper import ban as an exogenous shock and leverage
a distinctive feature of the paper product industry's supply chain. Using a
difference-in-differences strategy and firm-level data from 2000 to 2023, we
find that the policy shock increased the probability of vertical OFDI by
approximately 16% in the post-policy period relative to a control group. These
results provide robust evidence that firms respond to domestic input shocks by
reallocating production across borders, highlighting vertical OFDI as a
strategic response to supply-side disruptions. The findings contribute to
understanding the micro-foundations of global production decisions in the face
of input market volatility.

TL;DR: EconAgentic是一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于分析和改善去中心化物理基础设施(DePIN)市场的效率、包容性和稳定性，通过模拟AI代理对代币激励的响应来优化去中心化经济体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DePIN市场虽然增长迅速（2024年市值超100亿美元），但其去中心化、无监管的特性以及AI代理在智能合约中的自主部署带来了效率低下和与人类价值观错位的风险，需要新的框架来应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出EconAgentic框架，基于大语言模型，从三个关键领域进行研究：1)建模DePIN市场的动态演化 2)评估利益相关者行为及其经济影响 3)分析宏观经济指标以使市场结果与社会目标对齐。通过模拟AI代理对代币激励的响应、基础设施投资和市场适应，并与人类启发式基准进行比较。

Result: EconAgentic能够提供关于DePIN市场效率、包容性和稳定性的宝贵见解，证明该框架在理解和改善去中心化代币化经济的设计与治理方面具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 该研究为DePIN市场的学术理解和实践改进做出了贡献，EconAgentic框架能够有效应对去中心化市场中AI代理带来的挑战，确保市场结果更好地与社会目标保持一致。

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常将福利非领取视为理性决策，但缺乏对长期因素影响的实证证据，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用德国面板研究劳动力市场和社会保障数据(2008-2020年)，结合行政数据重建家庭福利领取和收入历史，首次应用GETTSIM微观模拟模型确定家庭资格。

Result: 长期福利领取历史增加领取概率，高收入潜力和正向收入冲击降低领取概率。忽略长期因素会导致现有模型设定错误。

Conclusion: 长期因素是福利领取决策的重要决定因素，应在相关政策分析和模型构建中予以充分考虑。

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that many households eligible for
means-tested benefits do not claim them, a phenomenon known as non-take-up.
Empirical studies frequently conceptualise non-take-up as a rational decision,
occurring when the perceived net utility of claiming is negative.
Theoretically, long-term factors can substantially impact this decision.
Despite the potential relevance of longitudinal aspects, evidence on their
influence remains limited.
  This study addresses this gap by incorporating long-term factors in the
analysis of non-take-up behaviour relating to Unemployment Benefit II (UB II),
Germany's basic means-tested welfare programme. Using data from the German
Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) from 2008 to 2020, linked
with administrative data from Germany's Federal Employment Agency (PASS-ADIAB),
this study reconstructs households' benefit receipt and income histories, even
during non-survey periods. This allows modelling benefit non-take-up for
eligible households using the duration and frequency of past benefit receipt.
In addition, the use of administrative data mitigates bias from self-reported
benefit receipt. Household eligibility for UB II is simulated using GETTSIM, an
open-source microsimulation model, applied to the PASS dataset for the first
time.
  Findings indicate that long-term factors significantly influence the
probability of claiming UB II. Specifically, a longer history of benefit
receipt increases this probability, whereas higher income potential and
positive income shocks reduce it. Including long-term factors substantially
affects the estimated impact of traditionally used determinants of non-take-up,
indicating a potential misspecification in existing models that neglect them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经济复杂性指数（ECI）虽然能有效预测经济增长，但其基于同质能力组合的微观基础模型与产品空间的实际拓扑结构不一致，无法解释不同产品类别需要不同能力的事实。

Method: 通过两个创新扩展组合模型：1）建立能力相关性的底层网络；2）用细粒度的产品级产出函数替代原有的二元专业化函数。使用216个国家、5000种产品、20年的贸易数据进行验证。

Result: 模型能够准确复制产品空间的特征拓扑结构和国家出口篮子的复杂性分布，将经济复杂性度量转化为对经济体能力的直接度量，提高了ECI预测经济增长的信息价值。

Conclusion: 该模型弥合了ECI与能力之间的差距，使经济复杂性能够作为生产能力替代性的代理指标，为理解经济发展提供了更坚实的基础。

Abstract: Economic complexity - a group of dimensionality-reduction methods that apply
network science to trade data - represented a paradigm shift in development
economics towards materializing the once-intangible concept of capabilities as
inferrable and quantifiable. Measures such as the Economic Complexity Index
(ECI) and the Product Space have proven their worth as robust estimators of an
economy's subsequent growth; less obvious, however, is how they have come to be
so. Despite ECI drawing its micro-foundations from a combinatorial model of
capabilities, where a set of homogeneous capabilities combine to form products
and the economies which can produce them, such a model is consistent with
neither the fact that distinct product classes draw on distinct capabilities,
nor the interrelations between different products in the Product Space which so
much of economic complexity is based upon.
  In this paper, we extend the combinatorial model of economic complexity
through two innovations: an underlying network which governs the relatedness
between capabilities, and a production function which trades the original
binary specialization function for a fine-grained, product-level output
function. Using country-product trade data across 216 countries, 5000 products
and two decades, we show that this model is able to accurately replicate both
the characteristic topology of the Product Space and the complexity
distribution of countries' export baskets. In particular, the model bridges the
gap between the ECI and capabilities by transforming measures of economic
complexity into direct measures of the capabilities held by an economy - a
transformation shown to both improve the informativeness of the Economic
Complexity Index in predicting economic growth and enable an interpretation of
economic complexity as a proxy for productive structure in the form of
capability substitutability.

Motivation: 分析中国辽宁省和内蒙古地区不同民族群体（蒙古族、满族、汉族）的收入差距，评估家庭政策对少数民族就业的效果

Method: 采用2018年中国家庭收入调查数据，使用OLS线性回归、交互项回归和Blinder-Oaxaca分解法分析收入差距

Result: 农村地区蒙古族存在显著的无缚时差距，城市收入差距主要由公务员职业和党员身份解释，蒙古族在公务员职业和党员身份上获得更高回报

Conclusion: 中国的家庭政策有效促进了少数民族与汉族在劳动办市场中的融合，结果与以往研究一致

Abstract: This study analyzes the 2018 Chinese Household Income Project survey data to
evaluate the income gaps between an "outsider" ethnic minority group, the
Mongols, an "insider" ethnic minority group, the Manchus, and the majority Han
group in urban and rural areas of Liaoning province and Inner Mongolia in
China. Three statistical methods, a simple first-order OLS linear regression,
linear regressions with interaction terms, and the Blinder-Oaxaca
Decomposition, are used to investigate the income disparity amongst the three
groups. The results indicate that Mongols suffer a significant ethnic wage
penalty attributable to possible discrimination in the rural areas of these two
provinces, while the urban income gaps between the three groups can mostly be
explained by participation in public sector occupations or affiliation with the
Chinese Communist Party. In rural settings, Mongols also have higher returns to
public sector jobs and CCP membership compared to the other two ethnic groups.
The findings suggest that Chinese affirmative actions regarding ethnic policy
are effective in accelerating the integration of ethnic minorities with Han in
the outcomes of the labor market. This conclusion is consistent with previous
studies.

Motivation: 随着健康系统建模的发展，需要建立更完整的医疗保健生产过程概念特征。Leontief技术（固定投入比例）在经济学中被认为限制性强，但作者希望验证其在真实健康系统建模中的适用性。

Method: 在马拉维Thanzi La Onse模型中采用基于Leontief技术的生产方法，将其整合到全疾病、基于代理的建模框架中，分析其在健康系统投资回报研究中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，一旦将Leontief技术整合到基于代理的全疾病模型中，其原有的限制性特性（如规模收益不变、分段线性水平集）不再存在，该框架成为描述医疗保健生产的丰富结构。

Conclusion: Leontief框架为描述医疗保健生产和检验健康系统投资回报提供了丰富的结构基础，证明了其在复杂健康系统建模中的实用价值。

Abstract: As health system modeling (HSM) advances to include more complete
descriptions of the production of healthcare, it is important to establish a
robust conceptual characterisation of the production process. For the Thanzi La
Onse model in Malawi we have incorporated an approach to production that is
based on a form of Leontief technology -- fixed input proportions. At first
sight, this form of technology appears restrictive relative to the general
conception of a production function employed in economics. In particular, the
Leontief technology is associated with constant returns to scale, and level
sets that are piecewise linear, both of which are highly restrictive
properties. In this article we demonstrate that once incorporated into an all
disease, agent-based model these properties are no longer present and the
Leontief framework becomes a rich structure for describing healthcare
production, and hence for examining the returns to health systems investments.

Motivation: 传统社会学习模型假设代理人只关心选择正确行动，但现实中人们往往有非从众动机（如追求独特性、获得少数派奖励）。本文旨在研究这种非从众偏好如何影响信息聚合和社会学习过程

Method: 在Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch社会学习模型中嵌入非从众偏好，使用高斯-二次规范，分析外生信号和内生的信息获取（固定进入成本和精度凸成本）

Result: 非从众动机使均衡临界点偏离1/2，扩大信息购买的信令区域，维持信息性行动；在投资条件下，中央信念附近的精度选择较低；温和的非从众可以抵消过早从众，而强烈的非从众会导致低价值实验

Conclusion: 非从众偏好通过权衡机制影响社会福利：适度非从众有益于信息聚合，但过度非从众会破坏社会信号的信息价值，在科学优先权竞赛和学术传播等应用中需要平衡独特性和信息聚合

Abstract: We embed a taste for nonconformism into a canonical
Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch social-learning model. Agents value both
correctness and choosing the minority action (fixed or proportion-based bonus).
We study exogenous signals and endogenous acquisition with a fixed entry cost
and convex cost of precision in a Gaussian-quadratic specification. Contrarian
motives shift equilibrium cutoffs away from 1/2 and expand the belief region
where information is purchased, sustaining informative actions; conditional on
investing, chosen precision is lower near central beliefs. Welfare is shaped by
a trade-off: mild contrarianism counteracts premature herding, whereas strong
contrarianism steers actions against informative social signals and induces
low-value experimentation. A tractable characterization delivers closed-form
cutoffs, comparative statics, and transparent welfare comparisons. Applications
include scientific priority races and academic diffusion, where distinctiveness
yields rents yet excessive contrarianism erodes information aggregation.

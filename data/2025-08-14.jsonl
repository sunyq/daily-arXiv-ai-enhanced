However, synchronizing these two modalities remains a\nsignificant challenge due to temporal and spatial inaccuracies in manually\nrecorded event timestamps. Existing synchronizers typically rely on annotated\nevent locations, which themselves are prone to spatial errors and thus can\ndistort synchronization results. To address this issue, we propose ELASTIC\n(Event-Location-AgnoSTIC synchronizer), a synchronization framework that only\nuses features derived from tracking data. ELASTIC also explicitly detects the\nend times of pass-like events and separates the detection of major and minor\nevents, which improves the completeness of the synchronized output and reduces\nerror cascade across events. We annotated the ground truth timestamps of 2,134\nevents from three Eredivisie matches to measure the synchronization accuracy,\nand the experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC outperforms existing\nsynchronizers by a large margin."}

Existing log parsers can be categorized into\nstatistic-based and semantic-based approaches. In comparison to semantic-based\nparsers, existing statistic-based parsers tend to be more efficient, require\nlower computational costs, and be more privacy-preserving thanks to on-premise\ndeployment, but often fall short in their accuracy (e.g., grouping or parsing\naccuracy) and generalizability. Therefore, it became a common belief that\nstatistic-based parsers cannot be as effective as semantic-based parsers since\nthe latter could take advantage of external knowledge supported by pretrained\nlanguage models. Our work, however, challenges this belief with a novel\nstatistic-based parser, PIPLUP. PIPLUP eliminates the pre-assumption of the\nposition of constant tokens for log grouping and relies on data-insensitive\nparameters to overcome the generalizability challenge, allowing \"plug and play\"\non given log files. According to our experiments on an open-sourced large log\ndataset, PIPLUP shows promising accuracy and generalizability with the\ndata-insensitive default parameter set. PIPLUP not only outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art statistic-based log parsers, Drain and its variants, but also\nobtains a competitive performance compared to the best unsupervised\nsemantic-based log parser (i.e., LUNAR). Further, PIPLUP exhibits low time\nconsumption without GPU acceleration and external API usage; our simple,\nefficient, and effective approach makes it more practical in real-world\nadoptions, especially when costs and privacy are of major concerns."}

Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as\nblurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable\ntrade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction\nattacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we\npropose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into\nprivacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image\ntransmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nfor nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic\naccuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of\nreplay attacks to just 9.4\\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously\ngenerating richer textual content than baseline methods.

The recent\nsuccess of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy\nthem efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference\nin MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given\ntoken. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For\nefficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of\nservers using a model placement algorithm. Thus, to improve cluster\nutilization, the model placement algorithm has to take into account the network\ntopology. This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the\npre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage. We propose an integer linear\nprogram (ILP) that determines the optimal placement of experts, minimizing the\nexpected number of transmissions.

These challenges are\nnow exacerbated by information overload, fragmentation of the evidence base,\nand increasing reliance on publicly available sources that lack expert\nfiltering. This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus.

This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles.

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces\ncomputational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part\nof the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation."}

This paper investigates how VLMs can amplify geo-economic biases when\ngenerating chart summaries, potentially causing societal harm. Specifically, we\nconduct a large-scale evaluation of geo-economic biases in VLM-generated chart\nsummaries across 6,000 chart-country pairs from six widely used proprietary and\nopen-source models to understand how a country's economic status influences the\nsentiment of generated summaries. Our analysis reveals that existing VLMs tend\nto produce more positive descriptions for high-income countries compared to\nmiddle- or low-income countries, even when country attribution is the only\nvariable changed. We also find that models such as GPT-4o-mini,\nGemini-1.5-Flash, and Phi-3.5 exhibit varying degrees of bias. We further\nexplore inference-time prompt-based debiasing techniques using positive\ndistractors but find them only partially effective, underscoring the complexity\nof the issue and the need for more robust debiasing strategies. Our code and\ndataset are publicly available here."}

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success\nrates by $67\\%$ and harmfulness by $21\\%$, revealing a previously\nunderappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems."}

In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze\nexisting expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter\nmerging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying\ntheir limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert\noffloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert\ncaching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the\ninterdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The\nCoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility\nand varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across\nheterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds\ndemonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage\ncompared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing\nexpert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability.\nFor large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE\nreduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on\nresource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support\nmuch smaller models."}

Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals.

Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals.

However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly\nimproves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction\nfidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover\nclassification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,\nunderpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote\nsensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery."}

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic.

The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus. Its successful application across health, coaching, and performance\nscience confirms its methodological robustness and supports its use as a\nfoundation for generating conditional, personalised guidance and published\nconsensus frameworks at scale."}

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and\ndiverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,\nsuch as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing\ngenerative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and\nanatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method.

In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

While recent\nadvancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,\nhead editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due\nto the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and\nglobal appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head\nAvatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the\ngeometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled\ntexture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two\ntypes of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance\nof head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture\nediting, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of\nnon-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence\nbetween 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping\nmethod, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp\ntexture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization\nstrategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both\nreconstruction quality and editing flexibility.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark."}

Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we\nleverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse\nsemantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then\nadaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top\nof the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat\nstate-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct\nextensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our\nDSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than\nexisting approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic\nforgetting issue as well."}

To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via\ndiagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language\nmodel with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a\ndiagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated\nsentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding\nmodule is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the\nworking efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we\npropose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to\nleverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead\nto 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a\nevaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion\nlocation and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist\nmodels consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by\naccurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images."}

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does\nnot serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their\nmathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been\nestablished as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we\npropose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to\neffectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a\nregularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image\nrestoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants\nof ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,\nrespectively.

In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our\nalgorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,\nwhich enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in\nreal-world data."}

The first,\na 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a\nsingle person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity\nrepresentation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid\ncloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and\nimpractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,\nlearns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but\nstruggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.\nWe present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches\nto obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a\nsingle image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate\npose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.\nTo ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we\nintroduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced\nsampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in\ndiffusion-generated training videos.

These applications often\nbenefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can\nthen be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask.\nFor example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first\nselect an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary,\nand then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from\nthe summarized record.

We also introduce a new Scene\nDiversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.\nOur qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that\nStory2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging\nstoryboards than existing baselines."}

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability."}

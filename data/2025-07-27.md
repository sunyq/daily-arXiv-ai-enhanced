### [1] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究利用符号回归（SR）和答案集编程（ASP）结合的方法，从数值模拟数据中推导出可解释的数学关系，用于建模三维不可压缩流动，并确保模型的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解流动物理与准确预测同样重要，而传统机器学习方法缺乏可解释性。因此，研究旨在通过SR揭示流动的数学关系，并结合ASP确保模型的物理合理性。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值模拟数据中推导符号方程，并结合ASP框架生成物理上合理的表达式。

Result: 推导出的符号方程不仅近似模拟了抛物线速度分布和压力降，还与文献中的解析解完全一致。

Conclusion: 研究展示了SR简化复杂流动行为的能力，以及知识表示方法提升数据驱动模型可靠性的潜力，为可解释预测和实时数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

### [2] [I2I-STRADA -- Information to Insights via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17874)
*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA是一种基于结构化推理的多智能体框架，用于数据分析，强调认知工作流的建模，优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在数据分析中忽略了结构化推理过程，而真实世界分析需要一致的认知工作流。

Method: 提出I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务建模分析推理的认知步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中表现优于现有系统，规划一致性和洞察对齐性更优。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析智能体设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种定性时间轴规划的片段，其计划存在性问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，从而能够合成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定性时间轴规划的计划存在性问题已被证明是PSPACE完全的，但非确定性自动机无法直接用于合成策略，需要昂贵的确定性化步骤。本文旨在找到可以直接映射到确定性自动机的规划片段。

Method: 识别定性时间轴规划的一个片段，其计划存在性问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题。同时，确定了适合该确定性片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Result: 成功识别了一个可直接映射到确定性自动机的规划片段，并确定了适合该片段的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 该确定性片段为合成规划策略提供了更高效的方法，避免了非确定性自动机的复杂性。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

### [5] [E.A.R.T.H.: Structuring Creative Evolution through Model Error in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18004)
*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过错误生成、放大、精炼选择、转换和利用反馈五个阶段，将AI生成的错误转化为创意资产，显著提升创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正创造力，提出‘创意潜藏于失败中’的理念。

Method: 采用LLaMA-2-7B-Chat等工具，结合结构化提示、语义评分和人类反馈，设计复合奖励函数（新颖性、惊喜性、相关性）。

Result: 创造力评分提升70.4%，口号更短、更新颖，跨模态测试显示强对齐性，人类评价中60%输出得分≥4.0。

Conclusion: 错误驱动和反馈驱动的生成方法能有效提升AI创造力，为自进化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨图表是否有助于AI系统分析数据，实验表明视觉语言模型在数据伴随散点图时表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究图表是否对AI系统分析数据有帮助。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5两种视觉语言模型，在三种分析任务中比较数据伴随散点图、空白图和不匹配图的效果。

Result: 伴随散点图时，模型描述数据更精确准确，尤其在复杂数据集上。

Conclusion: 初步证明AI系统也能从可视化中受益。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

### [7] [Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18059)
*Yueheng Li,Guangming Xie,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGPO是一个新型多智能体强化学习框架，通过集中式训练与分散式执行的结合，解决了现有CTDE方法在集中训练利用不足和理论保障缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法在集中训练利用不足且缺乏理论保障，限制了多智能体强化学习的性能。

Method: MAGPO通过自回归联合策略实现可扩展的协调探索，并明确将其与分散策略对齐，确保在部分可观测性下的可部署性。

Result: 在6个不同环境的43个任务中，MAGPO表现优于现有CTDE基线，并匹配或超越完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论保障和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASI-Arch是一种人工超级智能系统，用于自主进行神经网络架构创新，突破了人类认知限制，发现了106种先进的线性注意力架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI研究受限于人类认知能力的问题，推动AI自主创新。

Method: 通过完全自主的端到端研究流程，包括假设生成、代码实现、训练和验证，进行架构发现。

Result: 在20,000 GPU小时内完成1,773次实验，发现106种SOTA架构，并建立了科学发现的扩展定律。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为AI自主加速研究提供了蓝图，展示了计算可扩展的研究进展。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

### [9] [Agentic AI framework for End-to-End Medical Data Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18115)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Shayan Vassef,Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种Agentic AI框架，自动化临床数据从输入到推理的整个流程，通过模块化、任务特定的代理处理结构化和非结构化数据，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器学习解决方案的构建和部署成本高且劳动密集，主要由于预处理流程碎片化、模型兼容性问题以及严格的数据隐私限制。

Method: 框架通过多个代理（如数据匿名化代理、特征提取代理、模型匹配代理等）自动化处理数据，包括特征选择、模型选择和预处理推荐。

Result: 在老年医学、姑息治疗和结肠镜成像等公开数据集上验证了框架的有效性，能够自动完成数据预处理和模型推理。

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少了机器学习生命周期中的专家干预需求，为临床环境中的AI应用提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究利用自然语言处理（NLP）和主动学习技术，从急诊分诊记录中快速开发分类器，以检测潜在的疫苗安全问题，从而提升疫苗安全监测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于临床试验中安全数据收集时间有限，且疫苗广泛接种后需加强监测，亟需开发高效的后许可疫苗安全监测系统。

Method: 结合NLP和主动学习技术，利用急诊分诊记录开发分类器，并通过数据增强和主动学习优化模型性能。

Result: 提出的方法能够更准确、高效地从急诊记录中识别疫苗安全问题，减少误报并降低对关键词修改的依赖。

Conclusion: NLP与主动学习的结合为疫苗安全监测提供了快速、可靠的解决方案，有望提升公共卫生应对能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [11] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，表达力介于最大聚合和求和聚合之间；在均匀设置下，其表达力低于求和和最大聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与最大和求和聚合进行比较，以理解其在图数据建模中的优势和局限。

Method: 在非均匀和均匀设置下，分别分析均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，并与模态逻辑和MSO（Monadic Second-Order Logic）进行对比。

Result: 非均匀设置下，均值GNNs的表达力与比率模态逻辑等价；均匀设置下，其表达力低于求和和最大聚合GNNs。

Conclusion: 均值聚合GNNs的表达力在不同设置下有所不同，其表现受聚合函数和逻辑框架的影响，为设计更高效的GNNs提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种认知归因框架，通过分解知识检索和推理调整两个阶段，量化大型语言模型（LLMs）中知识和推理的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分LLMs中的知识和推理能力对模型分析、可解释性和开发至关重要。

Method: 通过快速思维和慢速思维两种认知模式，分解LLMs的认知过程，分析不同模式下的表现。

Result: 研究发现推理调整具有领域特异性，参数扩展能显著提升知识能力，且知识和推理分别集中在网络的不同层次。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解LLMs提供了新视角，并对现有研究如扩展法则、知识编辑等提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

Motivation: 研究非最小模型语义的析取语义，探索不同方法的等价性和差异性。

Method: 比较四种析取语义，包括Forks、Justified Models、DI语义和Strongly Supported Models，分析其定义和性质。

Result: 证明Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛实际上一致，且强于Strongly Supported Models。

Conclusion: 三种方法构成一种共同语义，提供比稳定模型更广泛的解集，且强于经典逻辑处理析取的方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在欧盟AI法案背景下法律合规与基本权利保护的复杂性问题。

Method: 采用定义性平衡（比例分析）和可废止推理，分析AI部署场景及其对基本权利的多层次影响。

Result: 提供了AI风险分析的哲学基础，支持对高风险AI和通用AI系统的评估模型。

Conclusion: 未来将开发形式化模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效，但项重写系统的开发和验证过程较为复杂。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

Motivation: 金融领域需要LLM不仅具备事实准确性和逻辑推理能力，还需在不确定性下生成创造性和可行的未来情景。

Method: ConDiFi包含607个宏观金融提示用于发散思维测试，990个多跳对抗性选择题用于收敛思维测试，评估了14个领先模型。

Result: GPT-4o在流畅性上表现优异，但在创新性和可操作性上表现不佳；DeepSeek-R1和Cohere Command R+在生成可操作见解方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ConDiFi为评估LLM在金融领域的安全和战略部署提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，轻量级IB正则化方法在实际应用中高效且易于集成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

Motivation: 优化呼叫中心的路由策略，以最小化客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Method: 比较了基于模型（Value Iteration）和无模型（Proximal Policy Optimisation）的两种方法，分别使用理论模型和仿真模型。

Result: PPO方法在1000次测试中表现最佳，实现了最高奖励、最低客户等待时间和员工闲置时间。

Conclusion: 尽管训练时间较长，PPO方法在呼叫中心路由优化中效果最优。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Conclusion: 利用GPU加速CT算法是一种高效的方法，能够有效解决大规模表约束问题。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Conclusion: 强调了训练数据在概念探测中的重要性，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Conclusion: SafeLadder框架证明安全与能力可以协同进化，为构建可靠、可信的通用AI提供了通用方法。

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLM生成的理由进行监督微调，但其性能受限于模型的推理能力。Shop-R1旨在通过强化学习框架提升LLM的推理能力，以更真实地模拟人类行为。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和动作预测两阶段：理由生成利用内部模型信号自监督指导；动作预测采用分层奖励结构，防止奖励滥用并实现细粒度奖励分配。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线实现了超过65%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过强化学习框架显著提升了LLM在模拟人类行为中的推理能力，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

Motivation: 随着自然语言数据库接口的普及，缺乏统计背景的用户可能提出带有认知偏差的分析问题，这一问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: VeriMinder采用三种创新方法：上下文语义映射框架、基于Hard-to-Vary原则的分析框架，以及优化的LLM提示生成流程。

Result: 用户测试显示，82.5%的参与者认为系统提升了分析质量；在比较评估中，VeriMinder在分析的具体性、全面性和准确性上至少优于其他方法20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder通过开源实现，帮助用户避免数据分析中的“错误问题”漏洞，促进社区研究和应用。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,

Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，难以跨领域泛化，且静态评估标准无法适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度奖励标准，动态选择奖励信号，并利用Pareto支配估计处理多面奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明DG-PRM在基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM为复杂任务中的过程奖励建模提供了高效且泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the

structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing

Conclusion: 现有AI检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力存在差异，对抗攻击尤其是人化攻击显著影响检测效果。DeepSeek自身作为检测器具有潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出NeuralDB框架，通过神经键值数据库和非线性门控检索模块高效编辑大语言模型中的知识，同时保持模型的通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有线性L&E方法在编辑大量事实时可能损害模型通用能力或导致遗忘的问题。

Method: 将线性L&E方法建模为键值数据库查询，提出NeuralDB框架，使用非线性门控检索模块仅在涉及编辑事实时操作。

Result: 在10,000条事实编辑实验中，NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性上表现优异，且不影响模型在六项文本任务中的性能。

Conclusion: NeuralDB在扩展到100,000条事实时仍保持高效，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [32] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键输入标记并构建方向性引导向量，优化语言和视觉语言模型的行为，无需微调或额外监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时引导方法依赖固定干预向量，忽视输入标记的因果影响和梯度信息，尤其在多模态任务中表现不足。

Method: GrAInS利用对比梯度归因（Integrated Gradients）识别关键标记，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、MMHal-Bench和SPA-VL等任务上，GrAInS显著提升模型性能，同时保持流畅性和通用能力。

Conclusion: GrAInS提供了一种细粒度、可解释且模块化的模型行为控制方法，优于现有微调和引导基线。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

*Hoyeon Lee,Sejung Son,Ye-Eun Kang,Jong-Hwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，减少人工标注需求，解决语音领域的数据挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语断句预测方法依赖大量人工标注，成本高且数据一致性差，希望通过LLM生成合成数据来解决这些问题。

Method: 探索利用LLM生成合成短语断句标注，并与传统标注方法进行比较，评估其在多语言中的有效性。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据能有效缓解短语断句预测中的数据挑战，展示了LLM在语音领域的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM为语音领域提供了一种可行的解决方案，能够减少人工标注需求并提升数据质量。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Result: 实验显示LLM在生成多样且隐私保护的合成数据方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 基于评估结果，提出了一种改进方法以增强多样性同时保护隐私。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

TL;DR: TELEVAL是一个动态基准测试，专门用于评估口语模型在真实中文对话场景中的表现，重点关注显式语义、副语言和隐式语义以及系统能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注口语模型是否能完成复杂任务，而忽略了用户在实际对话中的自然交互方式，因此需要更贴近真实场景的评估方法。

Method: TELEVAL采用对话形式，分别评估文本和音频输出，特别关注模型从用户语音中提取隐式线索并恰当回应的能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有口语模型在自然对话任务中仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL可作为以用户为中心的评估框架，推动面向对话的口语模型发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

*Haomin Qi,Zihan Dai,Chengbo Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态混合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术的新方法，结合了BOFT的正交稳定性和LoRA-GA的梯度对齐快速收敛，显著提升了收敛效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLMs）的规模和内存需求，微调仍然是一个计算瓶颈。本文旨在通过参数高效的微调技术解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种混合策略，动态结合BOFT和LoRA-GA，并通过梯度范数指导的逐层自适应更新。同时，首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLMs。

Result: 在四个基准测试（GLUE、GSM8K、MT-Bench、HumanEval）上，混合方法在7B到405B参数的模型中表现优于基线，接近全微调精度，同时减少训练时间2.1倍和内存使用50%。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限的实际部署提供了一种实用且可扩展的LLMs微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2014年的GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但语言和世界在变化，且原模型文档不完善，因此需要更新。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练了两组词嵌入。

Result: 新模型包含更多文化相关词汇，结构任务表现相当，且在非西方新闻数据等NER任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 2024年GloVe模型在时效性和性能上优于旧版，适用于现代语言任务。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM是一种新型的端到端口语语言模型，专注于捕捉语音中的副语言和说话者特征，通过双模态头架构和分阶段训练策略，实现了语义和非语义任务的平衡表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有口语语言模型多忽略语音中的副语言和说话者特征（如方言、年龄、情感等），限制了自然交互能力。

Method: 采用双模态头架构分离语言建模和声学实现，提出模块化分阶段训练策略，逐步对齐语言、副语言和说话者特征信息。

Result: 在TELEVAL基准测试中，GOAT-SLM在语义和非语义任务上表现均衡，尤其在情感、方言和年龄敏感交互上优于现有开源模型。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了超越语言内容建模的重要性，推动了更自然、自适应且具有社会意识的口语系统的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的能力，重点关注多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE）。实验表明，现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍远落后于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括MCG（从零构建可视化）和MCE（细粒度操作：删除、修改和注释）。使用涵盖五种数学图形的数据集，评估九种主流MLLMs。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基于代码的多模态数学推理中仍有提升空间，尤其是在细粒度视觉操作方面。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在HIV管理中的能力，提出了HIVMedQA基准测试，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但模型性能随问题复杂性下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV管理复杂且缺乏AI应用研究，需评估LLMs在临床决策中的潜力与风险。

Method: 开发HIVMedQA基准测试，评估10种LLMs（7种通用，3种医学专用），结合词相似度和LLM-as-a-judge方法。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最优，但性能随问题复杂性下降；医学专用模型未必优于通用模型。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估LLMs，以确保其临床安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示并解决'sticky tokens'对文本嵌入模型可靠性和下游任务性能的破坏。

Method: 提出Sticky Token Detector (STD)方法，基于句子和token过滤检测异常token，并分析其来源及影响。

Result: 在14个模型家族的40个检查点中发现868个sticky tokens，这些token导致下游任务性能下降高达50%。

Conclusion: 需改进tokenization策略和模型设计以减少sticky tokens的影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过消除选项位置偏差和防止语义相似干扰项，提升LLM评估的公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多项选择任务中可能通过利用选项位置或标签的固有偏差获得高分，而非真正理解内容。

Method: SCOPE通过无语义内容的空提示估计模型的独特位置偏差分布，并重新分配答案槽以均衡幸运率，同时防止语义相似干扰项相邻。

Result: SCOPE在多个基准实验中表现优于现有去偏方法，性能更稳定，置信度分布更清晰。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提升LLM评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Motivation: 解决ISO30401实施者在解释知识管理活动如何与现有业务流程整合时面临的挑战。

Method: 结合ISO9001的流程建模原则，利用SECI模型和PDCA循环实现KMS的整合。

Result: 展示了KMS如何与综合管理系统中的其他流程无缝结合，并通过具体机制实现。

Conclusion: 通过SECI模型和PDCA循环，KMS可以有效地与现有业务流程整合，支持组织的知识管理目标。

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GMTP的新防御方法，通过梯度分析和掩码语言模型检测并过滤对抗性文档，有效保护RAG系统免受恶意注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统依赖外部知识库，但攻击者可能注入有毒文档，导致生成有害或误导性内容，因此需要一种有效的防御方法。

Method: GMTP通过分析检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，掩码后检查其概率，利用掩码语言模型检测低概率令牌以过滤恶意文档。

Result: 实验表明，GMTP能过滤90%以上的有毒内容，同时保留相关文档，确保检索和生成性能的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种高效的防御方法，能显著提升RAG系统的安全性，适用于多种对抗场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，指令微调（instruction-tuning）会显著增加大语言模型（LLM）对用户提供信息的依赖，使其更容易接受错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令微调对LLM接受错误信息的影响，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过对比指令微调模型和基础模型，分析其对用户提供信息的依赖程度。

Result: 指令微调模型更易接受用户提供的错误信息，且依赖程度更高。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法减少指令微调的负面影响，提升LLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune&Comp是一种无需训练的层剪枝方法，通过幅度补偿减少隐藏状态差距，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移除任何层会导致隐藏状态幅度差距，从而显著降低性能，需要一种无需训练的方法来解决。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp，通过离线重新缩放剩余权重来补偿幅度差距，无运行时开销，并采用迭代剪枝策略。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上剪枝5层时，困惑度减半，保留93.19%的问答性能，优于基线4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp是一种高效且无需训练的层剪枝方案，显著提升现有剪枝指标。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Locate-and-Focus方法，用于提升直接语音翻译中的术语翻译准确率，通过定位术语片段并聚焦翻译知识，减少无关信息干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前直接语音翻译中术语翻译准确性不足，现有方法难以充分利用翻译知识且易受无关噪声干扰。

Method: Locate-and-Focus方法：先定位术语片段以构建翻译知识，再通过多模态关联聚焦翻译知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效定位术语并提升翻译成功率，同时保持整体翻译性能。

Conclusion: Locate-and-Focus方法显著改善了术语翻译效果，为直接语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

TL;DR: 比较了六种OCR引擎在低资源语言（Sinhala和Tamil）上的零样本性能，发现Surya在Sinhala上表现最佳，Document AI在Tamil上表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（LRL）OCR问题，填补高资源语言（HRL）与LRL之间的研究空白。

Method: 评估六种OCR引擎（商业和开源）在Sinhala和Tamil上的性能，使用五种测量技术分析字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上WER为2.61%，Document AI在Tamil上CER为0.78%。

Conclusion: 不同OCR引擎在不同语言上表现各异，需针对性选择；同时提出了新的Tamil OCR基准数据集。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM框架通过LoRA技术，在不牺牲指令遵循能力的情况下，实现了LLMs的风格定制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业通信需要LLMs适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库使得这一目标难以实现。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器，先在基础模型上训练多样化的非结构化风格语料库，再将其与指令遵循模型合并。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持指令遵循的同时提高了风格一致性，并通过人工评估验证了品牌特定习惯的采纳。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs的风格个性化提供了一种高效途径。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Motivation: 发现LRMs在复杂推理任务中的潜在漏洞，探索攻击者如何精确控制模型的推理冗长性。

Method: 提出一种可调谐的后门攻击方法，通过数据污染和程序化生成的冗余推理步骤实现。

Result: 实验证明该方法能可靠地触发可控的推理冗长性增加，且不影响最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该攻击方法作为一种纯资源消耗向量，具有隐蔽性和实用性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/FZaKK/BadReasoner.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了机器翻译中性别标记不明确时的翻译问题，发现模型在性别明确时表现良好，但在模糊情境下未能表现出足够的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器翻译模型在性别标记不明确时的翻译问题，避免模型依赖刻板印象而非上下文信息。

Method: 使用语义不确定性指标评估模型在性别明确和模糊情境下的表现，并分析去偏方法的影响。

Result: 研究发现，模型在性别明确时翻译准确，但在模糊情境下不确定性不足；去偏方法对明确和模糊情境的影响不同。

Conclusion: 结论指出，模型应在性别模糊时保持不确定性，且去偏方法需针对不同情境优化。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，用于改进上下文学习（ICL）中的示例检索能力，解决了跨任务数据分布区分和细粒度反馈连接的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL的效果高度依赖于示例质量，但现有方法在跨任务数据分布区分和细粒度反馈连接方面存在不足。

Method: TDR框架将不同任务的ICL示例解耦，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈指导检索模块的训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR显著提升了性能并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松结合多种LLM提升ICL的示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决社交媒体宣传检测任务复杂且高质量标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 提出分层分类法组织14种细粒度宣传技术，采用LLM辅助预标注生成标注和解释，并通过知识蒸馏训练小模型。

Result: LLM辅助显著提高了标注一致性和时间效率，小模型通过LLM生成数据训练表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了支持，符合SDG 16目标，代码已开源。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Conclusion: CLEAR填补了LLM评估中具体原因分析的空白，具有实用价值。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

TL;DR: FinDPO是一种基于直接偏好优化（DPO）的金融领域专用LLM框架，显著提升了情感分析性能，并在实际投资策略中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线金融文本数据的情感分析对交易决策和市场动态影响日益显著，但现有监督微调（SFT）方法存在泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出FinDPO框架，通过DPO进行后训练人类偏好对齐，并引入'logit-to-score'转换方法生成连续情感评分。

Result: FinDPO在情感分类基准上平均提升11%，年化收益达67%，夏普比率为2.0。

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个能在实际交易成本下保持高收益和风险调整性能的情感分析方法。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于阿拉伯语表格数据的公开资源有限且语言特性独特，现有LLMs在此类数据上的表现不足，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 采用混合方法，先由LLMs生成初始内容，再由人类专家过滤和验证，确保数据集质量。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）上表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证任务中仍有显著挑战。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据的处理提供了宝贵资源和评估框架，未来需进一步改进复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraDe是一种新方法，通过将稀疏依赖图集成到LLM的注意力机制中，优化表格数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在表格数据生成中因注意力分散而忽略关键特征依赖的问题。

Method: GraDe使用轻量级动态图学习模块，结合外部提取的功能依赖，优先处理关键特征交互。

Result: 在复杂数据集上性能提升12%，在合成数据质量上与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: GraDe为LLM提供了结构感知的表格数据建模实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

across diverse tasks, their performance on specialized moral reasoning remains
unclear.
  This study provides the first comprehensive comparison between
state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned transformers across Twitter and Reddit
datasets using ROC, PR, and DET curve analysis.
  Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false
negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt
engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning
remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合分词策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer分词在捕捉DNA局部结构时存在分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题。

Method: 通过合并6-mer和经过600次BPE循环生成的BPE标记，构建平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中表现优异，准确率分别为10.78%、10.1%和4.12%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 混合分词策略能同时捕捉DNA的局部和全局信息，为基因组语言建模和下游应用奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: WINO是一种无需训练的解码算法，通过并行起草和验证机制，显著改善了DLLMs的质量与速度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLMs在快速并行生成时存在严重的质量与速度权衡问题，标准解码的不可逆性导致性能下降。

Method: 引入WINO算法，采用并行起草和验证机制，通过双向上下文验证和重新掩码可疑标记。

Result: 在GSM8K数学基准上加速6倍且准确率提升2.58%，在Flickr30K字幕任务中实现10倍加速且性能更高。

Conclusion: WINO有效解决了DLLMs的质量与速度权衡问题，展示了其在多种任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

stability and performance. Our system, based on the Qwen2.5-7B model, achieves
a Hard Score of 26.66, a Soft Score of 48.35, and an Average Score of 37.505 on

Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，现有方法成本高或泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，结合逻辑和检查机制，从无标签数据生成高质量指令调优数据。

Result: 构建了703k样本数据集，性能与DeepSeek-V3相当，成本更低，数据与下游任务相关性更高。

Conclusion: AQuilt为专业领域提供高效、低成本的数据合成解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

TL;DR: TRPrompt框架通过将文本反馈直接融入提示模型的训练，统一了两种优化提示的方法，无需数据集收集，并在数学数据集GSMHard和MATH上取得了最先进的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法分为两类：一类依赖文本反馈，另一类依赖数值奖励训练专用提示模型。TRPrompt旨在统一这两种方法，直接利用文本反馈训练提示模型。

Method: TRPrompt框架通过LLM对“好”提示的理解能力，结合文本反馈的高分辨率信号，迭代优化提示模型。

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH等数学数据集上，TRPrompt生成的查询特定提示达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRPrompt通过文本反馈训练提示模型，无需数据集收集，显著提升了提示优化的效果。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法通常使用固定标准（如‘有用性’和‘有害性’）来优化语言模型，但这种方法无法灵活适应多样化的用户需求。

Method: 从指令中提取清单，结合AI评估和专用验证程序对响应进行评分，生成强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RLCF显著提升了模型表现，包括FollowBench、InFoBench和Arena-Hard。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是提升语言模型适应多样化查询需求的关键工具。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

Result: 在文本到图像基准测试中表现优异，部分超越扩散模型，并在Graph200K基准测试中展示多任务能力。

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0是一个强大、灵活的统一多模态生成基础模型。

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,

Motivation: 传统体育视频分析模型计算量大且缺乏对运动细节的理解，无法捕捉关键的运动阶段（如准备、执行和后续动作）。

Method: 采用DWT-VGG16-LDA关键帧提取机制和V-DWT-JEPA2编码器，结合LLM解码器，生成详细的运动动作描述。

Conclusion: SV3.3B在体育视频分析中表现出色，技术细节丰富，计算需求低，适合实际应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理复杂提示（如多对象和属性）时表现不佳，受人类绘画过程的启发，提出分阶段生成方法。

Method: 将复杂提示分解为简化子提示，利用自注意力机制控制布局，并通过交叉注意力机制和质心对齐损失减少绑定噪声。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和新构建的风格组合基准测试中，Detail++显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Detail++通过分阶段生成和优化绑定机制，有效提升了复杂提示下的图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

Result: 模型性能差异显著，CLIP框架实现了高效零-shot选择。

Conclusion: FishDet-M为水下计算机视觉提供了标准化评估平台，促进智能海洋系统研究。

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine

*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用生成式AI（GenAI）评估皮肤癌分类器的公平性，发现合成数据是评估公平性的有前景方向，但数据差异会带来挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在皮肤癌筛查中的应用潜力巨大，但存在潜在偏见，评估和改进公平性至关重要。

Method: 使用先进的生成式AI模型（LightningDiT）评估公开的黑色素瘤分类器的公平性。

Result: 合成数据在公平性评估中表现良好，但若评估模型与合成数据训练数据不同，验证公平性会变得困难。

Conclusion: 提出利用合成数据评估和改进医学影像AI系统公平性的新方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer使用通道自注意力解决Transformer在图像修复中的计算成本问题，但忽略了局部伪影。DiNA结合滑动窗口和混合膨胀因子平衡全局与局部，但直接应用于去模糊任务效果不佳。DiNAT-IR通过通道感知模块改进，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在图像修复任务中因自注意力机制计算成本高而难以扩展至高分辨率图像的问题，同时弥补Restormer忽略局部伪影的不足。

Method: 提出Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA)结合滑动窗口和混合膨胀因子，并引入通道感知模块以整合全局上下文。

Result: DiNAT-IR在多个基准测试中取得竞争性结果，为低层计算机视觉问题提供高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR通过平衡全局与局部注意力，在图像修复任务中实现了高效与高质量的平衡。

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应特征细化（AFR）模块，用于提升无监督域自适应语义分割（UDA-SS）的性能，通过结合高低分辨率特征和高频组件优化分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA-SS方法在平衡局部细节和全局上下文信息时表现不佳，导致复杂区域的分割错误。

Method: 引入AFR模块，利用低分辨率逻辑的语义先验细化高分辨率特征，并集成高频组件以捕捉细节和边界信息，同时通过不确定性驱动的注意力平衡局部和全局信息。

Result: 在GTA V→Cityscapes和Synthia→Cityscapes数据集上，分别提升了1.05%和1.04%的mIoU。

Conclusion: AFR模块轻量且易于集成，显著提升了UDA-SS的分割性能。

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OPEN数据集，用于AI驱动的老年人虚拟学习参与度识别，填补了现有研究的空白，并展示了高达81%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟学习中参与度对满意度和表现至关重要，但现有研究缺乏针对老年人群的数据集和方法，且忽视上下文和长期性。

Method: 通过收集11名老年人六周虚拟学习的数据，提取面部、手部和身体关节特征，并标注参与度状态、情感行为标签和上下文类型。

Result: 训练多种机器学习模型，最高识别准确率达81%。

Conclusion: OPEN数据集为老年人群的个性化参与度建模提供了基础，并推动了参与度识别研究的进展。

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于YOLO模型的自动化系统，用于实时监测鬃狮蜥的行为（如晒太阳和捕猎），并分析了不同YOLO变体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监测鬃狮蜥行为的方法耗时且易出错，需要一种更高效、准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用五种YOLO变体（v5-v12）在1200张自定义图像数据集上训练，通过视频分析提取对象坐标，并应用时间插值和基于规则的逻辑分类行为。

Result: YOLOv8s表现最佳（mAP@0.5:0.95=0.855），晒太阳检测可靠，但捕猎检测因蟋蟀识别弱（mAP@0.5=0.392）而准确性较低。

Conclusion: 该系统为受控环境下的爬行动物行为监测提供了可扩展方案，未来需改进蟋蟀检测以提高准确性。

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Conclusion: AG-VPReID.VIR填补了空中-地面跨模态行人重识别数据集的空白，TCC-VPReID为解决相关问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 探讨医学AI系统中标签偏差对特定子群公平性的影响，尤其是子群大小和可分性如何影响模型表现。

Method: 使用EMBED数据集训练深度学习模型进行二元组织密度分类，模拟子群标签偏差，分析其对特征表示和性能的影响。

Result: 标签偏差导致模型特征表示显著偏移，偏移程度取决于子群大小和可分性；验证集标签质量显著影响子群性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了标签偏差对医学影像AI子群公平性的重要影响，为理解偏差后果提供了关键贡献。

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

TL;DR: 本文首次推导了基于刚性变换的Grassmannian特征可优化成本函数，解决了现有方法无法显式表示距离的问题，并提出了全局最优解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Grassmannian方法无法显式表示刚性变换下的距离，限制了其在配准问题中的应用。

Method: 通过数学证明，利用高维线性子空间的基作为成本函数的显式表示，并提出了基于变换基的可优化成本函数。

Result: 提出的方法在计算机视觉任务中优于现有解决方案，并提高了收敛性。

Conclusion: 该方法为Grassmannian特征配准问题提供了全局最优解，解决了表示模糊性问题。

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领先的多模态模型架构在复杂性上落后于大型语言模型（LLMs），因此需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 在CoCa模型的文本解码器和视觉变换器（ViT）编码器中引入高斯误差门控线性单元、均方根归一化和旋转位置嵌入。

Result: GRR-CoCa在预训练和微调任务中显著优于基线CoCa，对比损失、困惑度和CoCa损失均有显著提升。

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa的改进架构在视觉-语言领域提升了性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏伪造多样性，难以支持泛化性检测模型的开发，因此需要构建更全面的数据集。

Method: 基于Celeb-DF数据集扩展，引入Celeb-DF++，包含三种常见伪造场景和22种DeepFake方法生成的视频。

Result: 新数据集挑战了24种现有检测方法的泛化能力，揭示了其局限性。

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++为DeepFake检测的泛化性研究提供了重要基准，凸显了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频模型在长视频多场景转换上表现不佳，主要因为缺乏场景转换意识。

Method: 提出了Transition-Aware Video (TAV)数据集，用于训练模型理解场景转换。

Result: 实验表明，TAV数据集能提升模型对场景转换的理解，缩小生成与需求场景的差距，并保持图像质量。

Conclusion: TAV数据集是提升多场景视频生成连贯性的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Result: 实现了高质量和高保真度的渲染结果。

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型合成真实感前景，解决了可扩展配对数据不足的问题，平衡了真实性与场景多样性。

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Result: 在多种场景下，VLM-IMI在定量指标和感知质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VLM-IMI通过语义引导和跨模态融合，显著提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: Scenethesis提出了一种需求敏感的3D软件合成方法，通过ScenethesisLang语言实现用户需求与生成3D软件之间的可追溯性，显著提升了约束满足和视觉评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D软件生成方法无法精细控制元素且难以处理复杂空间和语义约束，Scenethesis旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 基于ScenethesisLang语言，将3D软件合成分解为多个阶段，支持独立验证、目标修改和系统约束满足。

Result: Scenethesis能准确捕捉80%以上用户需求，满足90%以上硬约束，视觉评估分数提升42.8%。

Conclusion: Scenethesis为3D软件生成提供了高效、可追溯的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺癌预后差，EUS图像分割因噪声和低对比度而困难，现有方法依赖大量标注数据。

Method: 结合BiomedCLIP文本编码器和LoRA适配的SAM架构，仅调整0.86%参数，实现自动分割。

Result: 在公开数据集上，Dice达82.69%，NSD达85.28%，优于现有SOTA模型。

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS为EUS分割提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，首次将提示学习引入医学图像分割。

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: HDF框架有效解决了样本异质性和优化不平衡问题，具有广泛适用性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Conclusion: 该模型通过结合共享编码器和部分特定解码器，成功捕捉了刺激和神经响应的长程时间结构，同时考虑了个体差异。

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Result: 在Fishyscapes、RoadAnomaly和Segment-Me-If-You-Can等真实基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种语义明确且计算高效的解决方案，适用于不确定性感知分割任务。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: 双向扩散机制能更精确匹配退化参数，提升生成质量，符合人类视觉感知。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Conclusion: WaveMamba通过高效的跨模态融合和频率特征利用，显著提升了目标检测的准确性。

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba结合UNet和mamba机制，通过噪声抑制模块提升医学图像分割的泛化能力，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在数据稀缺场景中过拟合噪声和无关模式的问题，提升医学图像分割的泛化性能。

Method: 提出Diff-UMamba架构，结合UNet和mamba机制，引入噪声抑制模块（NRM）过滤无关特征。

Result: 在多个公开数据集（如MSD、AIIB23、BraTS-21）和内部NSCLC数据集上，性能提升1-5%。

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba在低数据条件下显著提升分割准确性和鲁棒性，适用于医学图像分析。

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL是一种简化的自监督学习架构，通过门控特征融合有效整合多级表示，解决了金属材料显微图像分析中监督方法依赖标注数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金属材料显微图像分析依赖监督方法，需为每个新数据集重新训练，且标注样本少时性能不稳定。自监督学习虽有望利用未标注数据，但现有方法仍需大规模数据集。

Method: MatSSL采用自监督预训练于小规模未标注数据集，随后在多个基准数据集上微调模型。

Result: 在MetalDAM上达到69.13% mIoU，优于ImageNet预训练编码器的66.73%；在EBC数据集上平均mIoU提升近40%。

Conclusion: MatSSL仅需少量未标注数据即可有效适应金相领域，同时保留从自然图像大规模预训练中学到的丰富可迁移特征。

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

TL;DR: TeEFusion是一种高效蒸馏方法，通过将引导幅度直接融入文本嵌入并简化采样策略，显著降低推理成本，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类器无关引导（CFG）和复杂采样策略导致的高推理成本问题。

Method: 通过线性操作融合条件和无条件文本嵌入，无需额外参数，同时蒸馏教师模型的复杂采样策略。

Result: 学生模型推理速度提升6倍，图像质量与教师模型相当。

Conclusion: TeEFusion在保持高质量生成的同时，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在医学图像分割任务中未针对任务调整，且特征提取能力不足，因此提出LEAF以改进。

Method: 在微调过程中，用分割图直接预测替代噪声预测，并采用特征蒸馏对齐卷积层与基于transformer的视觉编码器特征。

Result: 实验表明，LEAF在多种疾病类型的分割数据集上提升了原始扩散模型的性能，且不影响推理效率。

Conclusion: LEAF通过改进训练方式和特征对齐，高效提升了医学图像分割的性能，无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图谱域的测试时自适应方法（GSDTTA），用于高效处理3D点云的域偏移问题，通过优化低频分量实现快速适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D TTA方法依赖计算昂贵的空间域优化或额外训练数据，难以处理点云的无序结构。

Method: 将点云表示为异常感知图，通过图傅里叶变换（GFT）转换到图谱域，仅优化最低10%频率分量，再通过逆GFT重构点云。结合特征图引导的自训练策略迭代优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有3D TTA方法。

Conclusion: GSDTTA通过图谱域适应和低频优化，显著提升了3D点云分类的效率和性能。

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

Result: 在三个典型数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且在严重通信延迟和位姿误差下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DATA网络通过系统化的特征对齐和语义表示增强，显著提升了协作感知的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

Result: 在nuScenes-Night和RobotCar-Night数据集上达到最先进的深度估计性能。

Conclusion: DepthDark在有限训练数据和计算资源下验证了其有效性，为低光环境深度估计提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

Conclusion: 该方法为大型视觉语言模型在科学研究中的应用开辟了新途径，缩小了大模型与领域特定发现之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的地面可见光相机尾迹序列（GVCCS）数据集，用于改进尾迹监测和物理模型校准，同时提出了一个统一的深度学习框架用于尾迹分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空的非CO2效应（如尾迹）对气候变化有重要影响，但现有模型和数据集在尾迹动态和来源追踪方面存在不足。

Method: 使用地面全天空相机记录尾迹，构建GVCCS数据集，并提出基于全景分割的深度学习框架进行尾迹分析。

Result: GVCCS包含122个视频序列（24,228帧），每个尾迹被单独标记和追踪，同时提供了飞行标识符。

Conclusion: 该工作为改进尾迹监测和模型校准提供了高质量数据和方法，有助于更准确地评估航空的气候影响。

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: SGCDet是一种基于自适应3D体积构建的多视角室内3D物体检测框架，通过几何和上下文感知模块动态调整不同视角的贡献，并采用稀疏体积构建策略优化计算效率。

Motivation: 解决传统方法中体素感受野固定和计算冗余的问题，提升3D物体检测的效率和准确性。

Method: 引入几何和上下文感知模块动态整合信息，提出稀疏体积构建策略选择高概率体素进行特征优化。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和ARKitScenes数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGCDet通过自适应设计和稀疏优化，实现了高效且准确的3D物体检测，且仅需3D边界框监督。

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过将频率信息嵌入频谱图，提出了一种改进鸟类声音分类的方法，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决鸟类声音分类中因环境噪声、重叠发声和缺失标签导致的挑战，现有模型在低信噪比或多物种录音中表现不佳。

Method: 通过可视化鸟类的音高模式、速度和重复（称为motifs），并将频率信息嵌入频谱图以增强物种区分。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在F1、ROC-AUC和CMAP上分别提升了7.3%、6.2%和6.6%，超越了BirdCLEF 2024的获胜模型。

Conclusion: 通过颜色化嵌入频率信息有效提升了鸟类声音分类的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

TL;DR: EgoExoBench是首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在自我视角（egocentric）和他人视角（exocentric）间跨视角推理能力的基准测试，包含7,300多个问答对，覆盖11个子任务。研究发现现有模型在单视角任务表现优异，但在跨视角语义对齐、视角关联和时间推理上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过跨视角的知识转移和整合进行学习，但目前的多模态大语言模型在此能力上尚未被探索。

Method: 通过构建EgoExoBench基准测试，包含11个子任务，分为语义对齐、视角关联和时间推理三大挑战，评估13种先进模型。

Result: 模型在单视角任务中表现良好，但在跨视角任务中表现较差。

Conclusion: EgoExoBench为研究具备跨视角智能的具身代理和智能助手提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的可变形卷积模块，通过注意力机制和前馈网络学习偏移量，实现全局特征变形，并在眼底血管分割任务中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统可变形卷积难以捕捉长距离全局特征的问题，同时适应复杂形状特征。

Method: 使用注意力机制和前馈网络学习子像素位移场，自适应地变形特征图，实现全局特征变形。

Result: 在眼底血管分割任务中，GDCUnet模型在公开数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该模块可应用于更多具有复杂全局自相似特征的机器视觉任务。

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在数字内容创作方面取得了进展，但生成高保真且时间一致的动态4D内容仍具挑战性。

Method: MVG4D通过图像矩阵模块合成多视图图像，并利用轻量级变形网络将3D高斯点云扩展到时域。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上，MVG4D在CLIP-I、PSNR、FVD和时间效率上优于现有方法，减少了闪烁伪影并增强了结构细节。

Conclusion: MVG4D为从最小输入高效可控地生成4D内容开辟了新方向，提升了AR/VR体验。

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

TL;DR: SynC是一个专为零样本图像描述（ZIC）设计的框架，通过重新分配语义对齐的图像-标题对来优化合成数据集，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据集修剪方法不适用于合成数据，因为合成数据中的标题通常规范，但图像可能不准确。SynC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SynC采用一对多映射策略，通过检索候选图像并使用循环一致性对齐评分器选择最佳图像。

Result: SynC在多个标准基准测试中显著提升了ZIC模型的性能，并取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SynC为优化合成数据提供了一种有效策略，从而提升了ZIC的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration for physical task completion has significant

AI-assisted human performance and demonstrate that AI-assisted collaboration
improves task completion.

Motivation: 现有姿态生成方法依赖中间表示或自回归模型，导致性能下降，尤其在长期生成中难以保持时间一致性。

Method: 采用相对运动预测机制和统一占位符令牌方法，直接在姿态坐标上操作，实现训练和推理一致的单次前向生成。

Result: 在Penn Action和F-PHAB数据集上，显著优于基于量化和自回归的方法，尤其在长期生成场景中。

Conclusion: 新方法通过消除中间表示和自回归误差，实现了更高效和一致的长时期姿态生成。

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有方法因材料数据简化和渲染方程限制导致的渲染结果（尤其是皮肤）真实感不足的问题。

Result: 在OpenHumanBRDF数据集和真实数据上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了材料估计和渲染的真实感，尤其在皮肤表现上。

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future
research, like Iwin 3D Attention in video generation. The code and models are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将连通性作为附加特征模块强行注入，导致特征空间耦合且缺乏标准化机制量化特征强度。

Method: DCFFSNet通过特征空间解耦策略量化连通性特征与其他特征的相对强度，并构建动态平衡的多尺度特征融合-分离架构。

Result: 在ISIC2018、DSB2018和MoNuSeg数据集上，DCFFSNet在所有指标上均优于现有主流方法，如Dice和IoU。

Conclusion: DCFFSNet有效解决了分割碎片化问题，实现了平滑的边缘过渡，显著提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像数据获取和标注困难，自监督学习（SSL）可利用未标注数据学习有用表示，但现有方法对噪声敏感且缺乏局部性理解。

Method: 采用V-JEPA框架（基于特征预测的自监督学习）并结合新提出的3D定位辅助任务，以增强ViT模型的局部性理解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同训练数据量下显著提升分割性能，最高提升8.35%（仅用10%训练数据）。

Conclusion: V-JEPA结合3D定位辅助任务在超声视频分割中表现优异，为小规模医学数据集的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE是一种高效且鲁棒的头部姿态估计方法，适用于数据有限且标注不精确的场景。

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理对抗性攻击在LiDAR 3D物体检测中缺乏可重复性和标准化的问题。

Result: 成功将仿真攻击转移到真实LiDAR系统，并提供了影响攻击成功因素的见解。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了公平比较，加速了研究，并增强了对真实LiDAR感知中对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Dual-Scale-Former（DSFormer）和块聚类策略的新框架，用于提升视觉地点识别（VPR）的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉地点识别在不同环境条件和视角下性能不稳定的问题。

Result: 在多数基准数据集上达到最优性能，减少30%训练数据需求，并显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉地点识别提供了更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Result: 微调后的MLLMs在问答任务中零样本性能提升73.2%，在意图预测和识别任务中性能提升最高达12.5%和11.0%。

Conclusion: PDB-Eval能有效弥合MLLMs与驾驶领域的差距，提升模型在相关任务中的表现。

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Method: 提出Rein-EAD框架，结合多步目标优化和不确定性导向的奖励机制，实现高效策略更新，无需可微分环境。

Result: 实验表明Rein-EAD显著降低攻击成功率，保持标准准确性，并能泛化至未见过的自适应攻击。

Conclusion: Rein-EAD是一种适用于复杂3D任务的主动防御框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Conclusion: CRUISE为V2X场景的数据增强和训练提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low

low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

Conclusion: SIDA通过合成图像和创新的风格建模模块，实现了高效且有效的零样本域适应。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

Motivation: 探索基础模型是否能在未经微调的情况下，对高度杂乱的视觉场景进行对象分割，应用于上肢神经假体的视觉引导。

Method: 提出基于注视点生成提示的方法，指导SAM模型进行分割，并在自我中心视觉数据上微调。

Result: 在Grasping-in-the-Wild数据集上，IoU分割质量指标提升高达0.51点。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实场景中有效提升了对象分割性能，为神经假体应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data

TL;DR: GaussianFusionOcc提出了一种基于3D高斯表示和传感器融合的3D语义占据预测方法，显著提升了预测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要精确且安全的3D语义占据预测，传统方法依赖密集网格表示，存在效率和精度问题。

Method: 采用语义3D高斯表示和创新的传感器融合机制，结合相机、LiDAR和雷达数据，利用模态无关的可变形注意力提取特征。

Result: 在多种传感器组合下表现出色，优于现有最优模型，同时提高了内存效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc通过多模态融合和高斯表示，实现了更精确、高效的3D语义占据预测。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Method: 提出提示组合策略和参数高效适配器，统一时空理解知识。

Result: 方法在多个开源模型上达到最优，并在IntentVC挑战中取得亚军。

Conclusion: 结合两种策略能有效提升模型在视频序列中建模空间细节的能力。

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

Motivation: EDM的固定高斯噪声模式限制了图像修复的进展，强制注入高斯噪声会破坏图像并增加修复复杂度。

Method: 提出EDA，支持任意噪声模式，保持EDM模块灵活性，且不增加计算开销。

Result: 在MRI偏置场校正、CT金属伪影减少和自然图像阴影去除任务中，EDA仅需5步采样即超越多数任务专用方法。

Conclusion: EDA通过扩展噪声模式自由度，显著提升了图像修复性能，尤其在偏置场校正和阴影去除任务中达到最优。

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Conclusion: TTS-VAR通过动态平衡和分层策略有效提升生成质量，粗尺度结构特征对最终质量影响显著。

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了高精度的无姿态重建，成为该领域的新标杆。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了大规模无姿态图像重建的挑战，为3DGS重建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

Result: 在合成和真实人脸变形图像上测试，性能显著优于现有方法，生成高质量去变形图像。

Conclusion: 该方法在去变形任务中表现出色，具有跨技术和风格的通用性。

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

Conclusion: ADM和DMDX框架有效解决了DMD的模式崩溃问题，提升了生成效率和性能。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

Motivation: Transformer在3D语义分割中表现强大，但二次复杂度限制了长距离依赖建模；Mamba虽高效但特征提取能力不足，结合二者优势是未解决的挑战。

Method: 提出HybridTM混合架构，结合Transformer和Mamba，并引入Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy，在更细粒度上整合注意力与Mamba。

Result: 在ScanNet、ScanNet200和nuScenes等数据集上达到SOTA性能，验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HybridTM成功结合了Transformer和Mamba的优势，为3D语义分割提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的数据库系统，通过自然语言处理和LLM技术简化数据库管理，减少对技术技能的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据库系统对非技术用户复杂且难以使用，需要简化操作并提高可用性。

Method: 利用自然语言处理、LLM和机器学习算法，实现自动化的数据建模、查询生成和性能优化。

Result: 系统能够自动生成结构化查询和半结构化数据格式，减少人工干预和错误。

Conclusion: AI支持的数据库系统有望解决现有技术的复杂性和可用性问题。

Abstract: Contemporary database systems, while effective, suffer severe issues related
to complexity and usability, especially among individuals who lack technical
expertise but are unfamiliar with query languages like Structured Query
Language (SQL). This paper presents a new database system supported by
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of
data using natural language processing (NLP) - based intuitive interfaces, and
automatic creation of structured queries and semi-structured data formats like
yet another markup language (YAML), java script object notation (JSON), and
application program interface (API) documentation. The system is intended to
strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is
purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling,
schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present
in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current
database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills,
manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI
database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its
schema models and execution formats.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Bittensor的SN9展示了去中心化预训练LLM的可行性，但存在模型本地化和奖励机制问题。IOTA通过协作架构、连续激励和压缩技术解决了这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SN9中模型本地化和奖励机制的问题，实现更高效、公平的去中心化预训练。

Method: 引入IOTA架构，包括数据并行、连续激励、激活压缩、Butterfly All-Reduce和CLASP方案。

Result: 实现了模型规模的弹性扩展、公平奖励分配、通信带宽优化和贡献评估。

Conclusion: IOTA通过协作和优化技术，显著提升了去中心化预训练的效率和公平性。

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PolyServe是一种新型的多SLO调度策略，通过分组请求、负载均衡和动态共享资源，优化LLM应用的延迟和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将工作负载简单分为延迟敏感（LS）和尽力而为（BE），忽略了延迟敏感类别内的多样性，导致用户体验和调度效率低下。

Method: PolyServe将请求按每令牌延迟需求分组，调度到服务器子集，并通过负载梯度、动态共享资源和性能分析数据优化调度。

Result: PolyServe实现了1.23倍的吞吐量提升，达到最优吞吐量的92.5%。

Conclusion: PolyServe通过精细化调度和资源管理，显著提升了多SLO场景下的性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

*Pei-Kun Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该研究比较了五种基于软件的QUBO求解器（Neal、PyTorch CPU/GPU、JAX、SciPy）在不同规模和收敛阈值下的性能，发现PyTorch在可扩展性和运行时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同QUBO求解器在大规模问题中的性能，为实际应用提供选择依据。

Method: 使用随机生成的QUBO矩阵（1000x1000到45000x45000）和六种收敛阈值（10^-1到10^-6），比较求解器的解质量和计算时间。

Result: Neal解质量最高但内存限制大；PyTorch可扩展性最强且运行时间短；JAX表现接近PyTorch但变量限制更多；SciPy表现最差。

Conclusion: PyTorch是资源允许时大规模QUBO问题的最佳平衡选择。

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework
for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five
software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and
SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to
45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate
their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time.
Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was
limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption.
PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated
superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support
for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly
shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and
was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU.
SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and
consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation
times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality,
scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most
balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources
permit.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在资源受限的嵌入式平台上部署现代CNN的挑战，提出了基于RISC-V Vector 1.0扩展的解决方案，显著提升了图像预处理和YOLOv3的执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习推理的异构性和领域特定架构的出现，如何在嵌入式平台上高效部署现代CNN成为一个关键问题。传统硅缩放的限制和功耗/性能的权衡需要新的解决方案。

Method: 利用RISC-V Vector 1.0扩展，设计了一种灵活的编程模型和缓存层次结构方案，以减少预处理瓶颈和CPU回退过程。

Result: 实验结果显示，图像预处理速度提升了9倍，YOLOv3回退层执行速度提升了3倍，同时功耗低于传统并行执行平台。

Conclusion: RISC-V Vector 1.0扩展为异构嵌入式SoC提供了一种灵活的编程模型，能够平衡计算和内存占用，支持现代深度学习数据流。

Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting
deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of
modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant
development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most
expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural
processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of
traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance
tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system
integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these
heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system
integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution
in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware
integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory
hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally
verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at
runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator
speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V
Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within
a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and
CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image
pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.
We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable
a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs
supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than
traditional parallel execution platforms.

Method: 引入了FIFO、LRU和基于优先级的缓存策略，选择性转发重要模型更新以减少带宽使用。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和医疗数据集上的实验表明，通信量减少且准确性损失最小。

Conclusion: 智能缓存提高了可扩展性和内存效率，支持边缘物联网网络中的可靠联邦学习，适用于智能城市和医疗等延迟敏感场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves
scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少手动编写高性能深度学习内核的工作量，并解决现有基准测试在硬件支持、分类和任务覆盖方面的不足。

Method: 设计了MultiKernelBench，支持285个任务、14个内核类别和3种硬件平台，并提出了类别感知的单次提示方法。

Result: 评估了7种最先进的LLM，揭示了任务难度差异、平台泛化能力不足以及提示策略的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench为LLM在深度学习内核生成领域的评估提供了标准化工具，并展示了其潜力。

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

Abstract: What if you could piece together your own custom biometrics and AI analysis
system, a bit like LEGO blocks? We aim to bring that technology to field
operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system
that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP
(Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular
edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in
specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object
tracking, and document analysis. CHAMP leverages low-power FPGA-based
accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating
system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically
secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design,
including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK
operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic
capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments
demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute
accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of
the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field
biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future
improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.

Abstract: The latest generation of games and pervasive communication technologies poses

TL;DR: PowerTrip系统通过动态选择高功率可用性和低网络延迟的站点，优化大规模AI模型在分布式环境中的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模AI模型的训练需求超过单一数据中心的容量，而分布式训练面临通信开销的挑战。现有方法忽略了站点间功率供应的异构性。

Method: PowerTrip采用动态贪婪方法，基于功率-成本启发式选择站点，优化训练效率。

Result: 使用真实Google功率数据评估，PowerTrip比基线策略减少50%的时间达到目标精度。

Conclusion: PowerTrip有效解决了分布式训练中的功率-通信权衡问题，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and
power demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due
to the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional
computational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across
geographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach
introduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,
creating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing
greater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network
latency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or
using heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous
power supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability
between sites.
  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,
geo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically
selects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication
trade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost
heuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network
latency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain
in training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to
optimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network
overhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our
evaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power
capacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy
by up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CPI（每指令周期）的干扰预测方法，并设计了C-Koordinator平台，用于优化大规模共置微服务集群的资源利用和干扰缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务共置虽提高资源利用率，但会引入资源竞争和干扰，现有方法难以应对大规模、多样化的生产环境。

Method: 通过分析Alibaba集群特性，采用CPI作为干扰度量指标，并利用多维指标实现CPI的准确预测，设计C-Koordinator平台。

Result: 干扰预测模型准确率达90.3%，应用延迟在各百分位（P50、P90、P99）均显著降低（16.7%-36.1%）。

Conclusion: C-Koordinator能有效缓解共置干扰，提升微服务集群性能。

Abstract: Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight,
loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many
enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource
utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different
microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and
interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for
large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource
utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges
are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node
heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and
co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per
instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in
large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction
of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction
and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an
open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates
co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction
models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction
and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,
application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,
P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%
under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results
demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in
co-located environments.

Result: CoCoServe降低成本46%，延迟减少14%-75%，吞吐量提升1.16x-4x。

Conclusion: CoCoServe显著提升了LLM服务的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities across
various fields but has also introduced significant challenges in resource
management. Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing
serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic
patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and
performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of
adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of
efficient LLM serving.
  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates
dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level
operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder
layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs
associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that
dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance
optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit
excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining
availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging
Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and
achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and
workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing numerous industries, but
their substantial computational demands create challenges for efficient
deployment, particularly in cloud environments. Traditional approaches to
inference serving often struggle with resource inefficiencies, leading to high
operational costs, latency issues, and limited scalability. This article
explores how Cloud Native technologies, such as containerization,
microservices, and dynamic scheduling, can fundamentally improve LLM inference
serving. By leveraging these technologies, we demonstrate how a Cloud Native
system enables more efficient resource allocation, reduces latency, and
enhances throughput in high-demand scenarios. Through real-world evaluations
using Kubernetes-based autoscaling, we show that Cloud Native architectures can
dynamically adapt to workload fluctuations, mitigating performance bottlenecks
while optimizing LLM inference serving performance. This discussion provides a
broader perspective on how Cloud Native frameworks could reshape the future of
scalable LLM inference serving, offering key insights for researchers,
practitioners, and industry leaders in cloud computing and artificial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘视频分析（EVA）的复杂性增加，现有调度系统因调度周期长而无法适应快速变化的边缘环境，局部强化学习（RL）存在可扩展性和适应性不足的问题。

Method: FCPO整合CRL和FRL，动态调整推理批次大小、输入分辨率和多线程处理。CRL捕捉环境动态变化，FRL通过跨模型经验集成提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: FCPO通过结合CRL和FRL，有效解决了EVA系统中的动态调度问题，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of
intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving
systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload
distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended
scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge
environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments
between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability
issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated
RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts
inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and
post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision
Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves
generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across
inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme
and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA
testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced
latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption
compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

*Xiaoning Jia,Ruilin Kong,Guangya Si,Bilong Shen,Zhe Ji*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个优化的并行离散事件模拟（PDES）框架，解决了传统引擎在资源分配和复杂实体交互中的局限性，通过四项改进显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PDES引擎（如Warped2）在资源分配和复杂实体交互中存在性能瓶颈，无法满足大规模模拟的需求。

Method: 提出了四项协同改进：异步监听线程、METIS负载均衡策略、实体交互求解器和空间哈希算法。

Result: 实验验证显示，框架在计算效率和时序保真度上显著提升，比基线实现快16倍，同步开销减少58.18%。

Conclusion: 该优化框架为大规模模拟场景提供了更高效的PDES解决方案。

Abstract: Rising demand for complex simulations highlights conventional
engines'scalability limits, spurring Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
adoption.Warped2, a PDES engine leveraging Time Warp synchronization with
Pending Event Set optimization, delivers strong performance, it struggles with
inherent wargaming limitations: inefficient LP resource allocation during
synchronization and unaddressed complex entity interaction patterns. To address
these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic
improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event
monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling
mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to
address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)
Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed
to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome
O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.
Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant
enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark
results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline
implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI
and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration
strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing
accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization
factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation
in large-scale simulation scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的新型数据复制策略，用于云系统动态适应工作负载变化，优化服务质量和资源利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球数据量快速增长，需要可扩展的分布式系统来维持高质量服务。传统阈值激活机制依赖人工调整，难以适应动态变化。

Method: 采用强化学习模型，定义状态、动作和奖励，自动学习系统特性并适应工作负载变化。

Result: 策略旨在平衡服务质量、提供商利润和环境影响的权衡。

Conclusion: 强化学习为云系统数据复制提供了一种自适应解决方案，优化了性能和资源利用。

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable
distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data
replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved
performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on
threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload
changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the
responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,
reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and
different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication
strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically
learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim
is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off
between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture
behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining
the states, actions and rewards.

TL;DR: 提出Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE)，一种零样本的语义通道均衡器，用于对齐异构编码器的潜在空间，无需重新训练系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未来AI原生无线网络中，异构DNN编码器潜在空间不匹配导致的语义噪声问题，提升系统性能。

Method: 采用PFE进行动态信号压缩和扩展，结合动态优化策略协调通信、计算和学习资源。

Result: 在多样化时变网络条件下，保持语义一致性并满足延迟和准确性的长期约束。

Conclusion: PFE有效解决了语义噪声问题，优化了多智能体语义通信场景中的资源分配。

Abstract: In future AI-native wireless networks, the presence of mismatches between the
latent spaces of independently designed and trained deep neural network (DNN)
encoders may impede mutual understanding due to the emergence of semantic
channel noise. This undermines the receiver's ability to interpret transmitted
representations, thereby reducing overall system performance. To address this
issue, we propose the Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE), a zero-shot, frame-based
semantic channel equalizer that aligns latent spaces of heterogeneous encoders
without requiring system retraining. PFE enables dynamic signal compression and
expansion, mitigating semantic noise while preserving performance on downstream
tasks. Building on this capability, we introduce a dynamic optimization
strategy that coordinates communication, computation, and learning resources to
balance energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) latency, and task performance in
multi-agent semantic communication scenarios. Extensive simulations confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in maintaining semantic consistency and meeting
long-term constraints on latency and accuracy under diverse and time-varying
network conditions.

of network analytics functions in the evolution toward 6G can enhance the
application of AI in a broader network context, using ARCADE as a practical

Result: 通过智能家居原型验证，展示了模型大小与推理时间和准确性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 讨论了LLM-based IoT系统的潜在应用及关键挑战。

Abstract: The convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Internet of Things (IoT)
networks open new opportunities for building intelligent, responsive, and
user-friendly systems. This work presents an edge-centric framework that
integrates LLMs into IoT architectures to enable natural language-based
control, context-aware decision-making, and enhanced automation. The proposed
modular and lightweight Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLMs are
deployed on edge computing devices connected to IoT gateways, enabling local
processing of user commands and sensor data for reduced latency, improved
privacy, and enhanced inference quality. We validate the framework through a
smart home prototype using LLaMA 3 and Gemma 2B models for controlling smart
devices. Experimental results highlight the trade-offs between model accuracy
and inference time with respect to models size. At last, we also discuss the
potential applications that can use LLM-based IoT systems, and a few key
challenges associated with such systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过改进SNOW技术，利用D-OFDM子载波和Gold码伪随机噪声序列，实现了LPWAN的大规模可扩展性，显著提升了数据传输效率和能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LPWAN在大规模传感器网络中难以实现高效、低延迟的数据传输，而新兴的物联网和CPS应用对此有迫切需求。

Method: 采用分布式正交频分复用（D-OFDM）子载波和Gold码伪随机噪声序列，使基站能同时解码多个异步传感器的数据。

Result: 实验结果显示，SNOW的可扩展性提升了约9倍，同时保持了数据收集的及时性和传感器的能源效率。

Conclusion: 该技术为需要数万个传感器且对电池寿命和实时决策有高要求的物联网和CPS应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over
large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to
achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data
efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may
require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly
advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel
reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a
different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by
enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on
the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.
Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data
from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data
parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold
code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering
within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the
set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive
concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve
approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection
at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and
CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery
life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了5G NR V2I Mode 2下车联网中的公平接入问题和信息年龄（AoI），提出了一种联合优化框架，通过调整SPS选择窗口和MOEA/D算法，平衡公平性和AoI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆在相邻车道行驶时速度不同，导致RSU驻留时间和通信时长差异，引发网络资源不公平分配和驾驶安全问题，同时需确保数据的新鲜性。

Method: 定义公平性指数，采用SHS建模AoI，通过自适应调整SPS选择窗口，并应用LLM-Based MOEA/D算法进行多目标优化。

Result: 仿真结果表明，方案能有效平衡公平接入和最小化AoI。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了公平性和AoI的联合优化问题，为车联网提供了及时且相关的数据交付保障。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the fair access problem and the Age of Information
(AoI) under 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Mode 2 in
vehicular networks. Specifically, vehicles follow Mode 2 to communicate with
Roadside Units (RSUs) to obtain accurate data for driving
assistance.Nevertheless, vehicles often have different velocity when they are
moving in adjacent lanes, leading to difference in RSU dwelltime and
communication duration. This results in unfair access to network resources,
potentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received
data, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption
mechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to
guarantee timely and relevant data delivery. We propose a joint optimization
framework for vehicular network, defining a fairness index and employing
Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) to model AoI under preemption mechanism. By
adaptively adjusting the selection window of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS)
in Mode 2, we address the optimization of fairness and AoI. We apply a large
language model (LLM)-Based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on
Decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our scheme in balancing fair access and minimizing AoI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足新兴应用（如云游戏、XR和视频流服务）对高吞吐量、低延迟和高可靠性的需求。

Method: 提出一种与Wi-Fi 8标准化工作一致的Co-SR实现，并通过Wi-Fi模拟器在四AP的WLAN中评估其性能。

Result: 与DCF相比，Co-SR能降低31%至95%的延迟。

Conclusion: Co-SR在Wi-Fi 8网络中能有效优化频谱资源利用，提升网络性能。

Abstract: IEEE 802.11 networks continuously adapt to meet the stringent requirements of
emerging applications like cloud gaming, eXtended Reality (XR), and video
streaming services, which require high throughput, low latency, and high
reliability. To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR) can
potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This
mechanism is expected to enable simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting
spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network
performance. In this paper, we shed light on the performance of Co-SR for Wi-Fi
8 networks. For that, we propose an implementation of Co-SR aligned with
ongoing Wi-Fi 8 standardization efforts. The evaluation is done on a Wi-Fi
simulator, which allows us to study the performance of the proposed Co-SR
mechanisms in relevant scenarios. The results obtained in a Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) consisting of four APs show delay reduction with Co-SR ranging
from 31% to 95% when compared to Distributed Coordination Function (DCF).

*Henning Urbat*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的范畴论方法，扩展了Howe方法，用于证明高阶语言中行为一致性的程序同余性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具有定量特征（如概率性）的语言兴起，需要扩展共归纳方法以支持更精细的行为一致性概念，如行为距离。

Method: 通过抽象高阶规范（AHOS）和纤维化建模行为一致性，提出了一种通用的范畴论框架。

Result: 在自然条件下，证明了行为一致性在操作模型中形成同余性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于概率高阶语言，验证了双相似性和行为伪度量的同余性。

Abstract: Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural
equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of
languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions
of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most
notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive
reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a
program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the
language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as
\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific
language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a
uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal
dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled
by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very
general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of
behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via
fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental
congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the
categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an
AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a
congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and
behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI工具（如GitHub Copilot和ChatGPT）在软件工程中的实际应用，尤其是开发者如何信任、优化或拒绝AI生成内容。

Method: 基于实践者报告和土耳其、阿塞拜疆三个行业环境的观察，提出了一个过程模型和2D决策框架。

Result: 模型为开发者提供了结构化、轻量级的指导，支持更有效的人机协作。

Conclusion: 研究为AI在软件工程中的实际应用提供了实用指导，促进了人机协作的讨论。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: 提出了对严谨性和透明度检测工具开发的见解和建议，并公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data
for the study is available at https://github.com/PeterEckmann1/tool-comparison.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

Motivation: 项目制学习（PjBL）能提升学生的动机、参与度、批判性思维和协作能力，但其在计算教育中的采用仍面临挑战，研究旨在探索这些障碍及解决方案。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过在线调查收集80名计算教师的定量和定性数据，定量数据用统计方法分析，定性数据用主题分析。

Result: 结果显示，PjBL虽受重视，但采用受限于规划、项目设计和机构支持不足；教师更可能在有同行合作、专业发展和机构激励时采用PjBL。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要系统性支持结构，以帮助教师尝试和扩展PjBL实践。

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

Motivation: 尽管GHA提供了官方文档和社区最佳实践，但缺乏对其在实际开源项目中应用情况的实证研究，许多工作流可能过于复杂且不符合CI的简洁目标。

Method: 通过分析Java、Python和C++仓库中的大量GHA工作流数据，研究其结构、复杂性、异质性和合规性。

Result: 预计发现最佳实践的强项和改进空间，并揭示跨语言CI设计的差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果将有助于CI服务提供更清晰的指南和示例，优化文档和实践。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

Method: 开发了一个分类法，用于分类标识符名称相似性的不同形式。

Result: 初步分类法为研究者提供了分析名称相似性对代码理解、可维护性和协作影响的平台。

Conclusion: 分类法为进一步研究和改进提供了基础。

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个全面分析LLM供应链安全的数据集，揭示了深度嵌套依赖和显著漏洞，并提出了实用建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM系统的广泛应用，其复杂供应链中的风险被忽视，缺乏系统性研究基准。

Method: 收集了3,859个真实LLM应用，分析其依赖关系，并提取1,555个风险问题进行安全评估。

Result: 发现LLM应用存在深度嵌套依赖和供应链中的显著漏洞。

Conclusion: 需全面安全分析，并提供了实用建议以提升LLM系统的安全性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NoCode-bench是一个评估LLMs在自然语言驱动无代码开发中性能的基准测试，结果显示当前LLMs的任务成功率仅为15.79%，表明其在跨文件编辑和代码库理解方面仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自然语言驱动无代码开发的潜力，利用LLMs实现更高生产力和开发民主化。

Method: 引入NoCode-bench基准测试，包含634个任务和114k代码变更，通过文档更新与代码实现配对，验证LLMs性能。

Result: 最佳LLMs的任务成功率为15.79%，显示其在跨文件编辑和代码库理解方面的不足。

Conclusion: LLMs目前尚无法完全支持自然语言驱动的无代码开发，NoCode-bench为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了885个EAIR系统错误，揭示了18种根本原因、15种症状和13个受影响模块，提出了8种EAIR特有症状和8种特有原因，并构建了错误原因与模块的映射关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EAIR系统错误的普遍性和特殊性缺乏深入理解，阻碍了相关技术和实践的发展。

Method: 收集80个EAIR项目中的885个错误，分析其症状、原因和模块分布。

Result: 发现8种EAIR特有症状和8种特有原因，构建了错误原因与模块的映射关系。

Conclusion: 研究为EAIR系统错误的预测、检测和修复提供了新见解和工具。

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模糊测试技术生成的低质量驱动程序浪费资源且效果不佳，需要一种能理解库使用规范并高效调度资源的方法。

Method: 利用LLM理解库的合理使用和提取API组合约束，采用双调度框架管理API组合和模糊驱动程序，将其建模为在线优化问题。

Result: 在33个真实库中测试，Scheduzz显著减少计算开销，覆盖率为CKGFuzzer的1.62倍，Promptfuzz的1.50倍，OSS-Fuzz的1.89倍，并发现33个未知漏洞。

Conclusion: Scheduzz通过结合LLM和双调度框架，有效提升了库模糊测试的效率和覆盖率，同时减少了资源浪费。

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着系统复杂性增加，需要更全面的测试和虚拟原型设计。SystemC缺乏原生FMI支持，限制了其在协同仿真中的集成。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，通过FMI控制SystemC虚拟平台，并通过案例研究展示了如何通过FMI从外部工具获取温度数据。

Result: 该框架使目标软件能够在虚拟平台上运行并接收外部工具提供的环境数据，从而支持更广泛的软件测试和验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为软件测试和验证提供了更高效的方法，有助于提前完成硬件认证（如ISO 26262）。

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型生成的测试用例虽然有效，但常包含语法和语义错误，修复这些错误可以提升测试价值并为生成更多测试用例提供良好种子。

Method: YATE技术结合基于规则的静态分析和重新提示，修复错误测试用例。

Result: 在6个开源项目上评估，YATE平均覆盖32.06%更多代码行，杀死21.77%更多突变体，优于其他四种LLM方法。

Conclusion: YATE在测试生成中表现优异，能以较低成本显著提升测试覆盖率和突变杀死率。

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

Motivation: 研究目标是开发适用于所有类型问题的文件定位方法，而非仅限于特定类型（如缺陷）。

Method: 提供了一种数据管道，支持任意分支和合并实践；使用传统信息检索方法进行基线评估；通过统计分析研究已知偏差的影响。

Result: 基于缺陷启发式的方法在通用问题上表现不佳；不同问题类型间存在显著但小的性能差异；标识符对性能影响较小；结果因项目而异。

Conclusion: 需要研究通用模型，并开发可针对项目特性调整的方法。

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

Motivation: 手动代码审查主观且耗时，而现有AI方法（如LLMs）缺乏逻辑推理能力，无法完全理解和评估代码。

Method: 结合符号推理技术与大型语言模型，使用CodexGlue数据集测试，比较了CodeT5、CodeBERT和GraphCodeBERT等模型。

Result: 该方法提高了自动化代码审查的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 混合方法在自动化代码审查中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

Motivation: 探索RAG方法在闭源代码库中的性能，填补开源与闭源代码库之间的分布差异研究空白。

Method: 对26个开源LLM（0.5B至671B参数）测试两种RAG方法（标识符和相似性RAG），并采用词法和语义检索技术。

Result: 相似性RAG表现更优，BM25和GTE-Qwen检索技术效果显著，词法与语义检索结合效果最佳。

Conclusion: RAG方法在闭源代码库中有效，且结合多种检索技术可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

Conclusion: 新自助法为现有重采样方法提供了可行的替代方案，适用于具有时间依赖性的面板数据。

Abstract: Practical inference procedures for quantile regression models of panel data
have been a pervasive concern in empirical work, and can be especially
challenging when the panel is observed over many time periods and temporal
dependence needs to be taken into account. In this paper, we propose a new
bootstrap method that applies random weighting to a partition of the data --
partition-invariant weights are used in the bootstrap data generating process
-- to conduct statistical inference for conditional quantiles in panel data
that have significant time-series dependence. We demonstrate that the procedure
is asymptotically valid for approximating the distribution of the fixed effects
quantile regression estimator. The bootstrap procedure offers a viable
alternative to existing resampling methods. Simulation studies show numerical
evidence that the novel approach has accurate small sample behavior, and an
empirical application illustrates its use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高公共债务是否因负利率增长差异而无成本，验证Blanchard（2019）模型在印尼的适用性。

Method: 基于2004-2019年利率增长差异历史数据，修改OLG模型参数，模拟代际转移和债务展期情景。

Result: 发现财政共识不成立，债务增加导致经济波动和风险上升；降低初始禀赋或增加资本份额会削弱债务收益。

Conclusion: 政策建议谨慎对待公共债务增加，避免可能的不良后果。

Abstract: This study contributes to the discussion about how higher public debt may not
be costly because of the negative interest rate-growth differentials by
simulating OLG models introduced by Blanchard (2019) under uncertainty, showing
debt and welfare dynamics in two scenarios: intergenerational transfers and
debt rollovers in the case of Indonesia. The simulation is done by modifying
the model parameters based on interest rate-growth differentials historic data
from 2004-2019. It is found that the fiscal consensus does not hold when
implementing Blanchard (2019) analysis with Indonesian-based rate parameters.
Increasing public debt makes the economy more volatile and high risk. Modifying
other factors supports the initial finding, with lower initial endowment
diminishing the benefits of public debt and higher capital share under
Cobb-Douglas. When the threat of debt explosion appears, efforts to reduce debt
share will reduce the welfare of the society. The policy implication is to be
careful of the opportunity. Increasing public debt may not be the way to go,
avoiding possible dire consequences.

Conclusion: 专利并非创新成功的通用指标，研发的实际效果受行业和地区影响，新兴市场的创新绩效关系具有情境依赖性。

Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between innovation activities and
firm-level productivity among early-stage high-tech startups in China. Using a
proprietary dataset encompassing patent records, R&D expenditures, capital
valuation, and firm performance from 2020 to 2024, we examine whether and how
innovation, measured by patents and R&D input, translates into economic output.
Contrary to established literature, we find that patent output does not
significantly contribute to either income or profit among the sampled firms.
Further investigation reveals that patents may primarily serve a signaling
function to external investors and policymakers, rather than reflecting true
innovative productivity. In contrast, R&D expenditure shows a consistent and
positive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we
explore three channels (organizational environment, employee quality, and
policy-driven incentives) to explain the impact of R&D, identifying capital
inflow and valuation as key drivers of R&D investment. Finally, heterogeneity
analysis indicates that the effects of R&D are more pronounced in
sub-industries such as smart terminals and digital creativity, and for firms
based in Shenzhen. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that patent
output is a universal indicator of innovation success and underscore the
context-dependent nature of innovation-performance linkages in emerging
markets.

Motivation: 传统经济模型假设原子化代理是市场条件的接受者，而单代理RL模拟则激励代理成为环境操纵者，导致非均衡行为。本文旨在解决这一冲突。

Method: 提出了一种校准的均值场强化学习框架，将代表性代理嵌入固定宏观经济场中，并调整成本函数以反映经济机会成本。通过迭代算法收敛到自洽固定点。

Result: 该方法成功使代理策略与竞争均衡对齐，提供了一种可操作且理论合理的经济系统中学习代理建模方法。

Conclusion: 校准的均值场强化学习框架为计算社会科学领域中的经济系统建模提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

Conclusion: 绿色技术新闻冲击对经济和环境政策有重要启示，深化了对技术特定新闻的理解。

Abstract: This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of news about future
technological advancements in the green sector. Utilizing the economic value of
green patents granted to publicly listed companies in the U.S., we identify
green technology news shocks via a convenient and meaningful rotation of the
innovations from a Bayesian Vector Autorregresion Model (BVAR). These shocks
are decomposed into two orthogonal components: i) a common technological
component shared by both green and non-green innovation, that reproduces
response patterns similar to those expected from a technology news shock with
long-run impacts on productivity; and ii) an idiosyncratic component to green
innovation inducing inflationary pressures and stock price reductions. The
responses to the idiosyncratic component suggest the existence of a green
transition news mechanism related to expectations of more rigorous carbon
policies or stricter environmental standards in the future. The focus on green
innovation deepens our understanding about the effect of technology-specific
news shocks and provides information of practical importance for macroeconomic
and environmental policies.

TL;DR: 研究意大利黑帮渗透市议会对环境政策的影响，发现解散黑帮渗透的市议会后，环境政策在多方面改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨黑帮渗透对地方环境政策的负面影响，以及解散黑帮渗透市议会后的政策改善效果。

Method: 利用1991年意大利法律允许解散黑帮渗透市议会并替换为外部委员会的外生冲击，分析政策变化。

Result: 解散后，可持续发展和环境资本支出增加，垃圾分类比例提高，且对邻近城市有溢出效应。

Conclusion: 打击黑帮犯罪是改善受其影响地区环境条件的有效途径。

Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of organized crime infiltration in city
councils on environmental policies implemented in Italy at the municipal level.
To this purpose, we exploit the exogenous shock of the removal of a city
council infiltrated by the mafia and its substitution with an external
Commission, allowed in Italy by the law 164/1991. Our results suggest that
after dissolution, environmental policies improve in several dimensions: the
capital expenditure for sustainable development and the environment increases;
the current expenditure on integrated water system increases; the percentage of
sorted waste increases because, as we show, public expenditure is reallocated
toward sorted waste at the expenses of unsorted waste. These results are robust
to different specifications of the control group. In addition, we find
significant spillover effects: the dissolution of infiltrated city councils
implies an improvement in environmental policies in adjacent municipalities.
Our results have a straightforward policy implication, the need to combat
organized crime as a way to improve the environmental conditions of the
territories plagued by its pervasive presence.

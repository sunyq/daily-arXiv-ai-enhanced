### [1] [Learning-Based Planning for Improving Science Return of Earth Observation Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07997)
*Abigail Breitfeld,Alberto Candela,Juan Delfa,Akseli Kangaslahti,Itai Zilberstein,Steve Chien,David Wettergreen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种基于学习的动态目标指向方法（强化学习和模仿学习），用于改善地球观测卫星的数据采集效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、指向操作资源消耗大等限制，需要优化数据采集效率。动态目标指向技术可以利用卫星资源和预先仪器数据来智能地重新配置和指向主仪器。

Method: 提出两种学习方法：强化学习和模仿学习。这些方法基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。与现有的含有超参数的想象方法进行了对比评估。

Result: 模仿学习比最佳想象方法平均提高10.0%，强化学习平均提高13.7%。两种学习方法都能在相对较少的数据量下有效训练。

Conclusion: 学习方法在动态目标指向应用中显示出显著优势，能够提高地球观测卫星的科学数据采集效率。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

### [2] [EnvX: Agentize Everything with Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08088)
*Linyao Chen,Zimian Peng,Yingxuan Yang,Yikun Wang,Wenzheng Tom Tang,Hiroki H. Kobayashi,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EnvX是一个利用Agentic AI将GitHub仓库转化为智能代理的框架，通过自然语言交互和代理间协作实现软件组件的自动化重用，相比传统方法显著提升了执行完成率和任务通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件仓库虽然资源丰富，但当前的重用过程需要手动操作、容易出错且缺乏连接性。开发者需要阅读文档、理解API并编写集成代码，这些障碍严重影响了软件重用的效率。

Method: EnvX采用三阶段流程：1) TODO引导的环境初始化，设置依赖、数据和验证数据集；2) 人类对齐的代理自动化，让仓库特定代理自主执行实际任务；3) Agent-to-Agent协议，支持多代理协作。结合大语言模型能力和结构化工具集成。

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试中，使用18个跨领域仓库（图像处理、语音识别等），EnvX达到74.07%的执行完成率和51.85%的任务通过率，优于现有框架。案例研究证明了其多仓库协作能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从将仓库视为被动代码资源到智能交互代理的转变，促进了开源生态系统中更大的可访问性和协作性。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

### [3] [Trust Semantics Distillation for Collaborator Selection via Memory-Augmented Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08151)
*Botao Zhu,Jeslyn Wang,Dusit Niyato,Xianbin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于大型AI模型的教师-学生机制，通过任务特定信任语义提取和传递，实现高效准确的协作设备选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务所有者独立评估协作者可靠性时带来的数据交换开销大、推理复杂、动态环境变化导致信任评估效果下降等问题。

Method: 提出2TSD模型，采用LAM驱动的教师-学生机器人架构。教师机器人部署在服务器上，负责多维信任数据收集、任务特定信任语义提取和匹配分析，然后向学生机器人传递信任语义。

Result: 实验结果显示，2TSD模型能够减少协作者评估时间、降低设备资源消耗并提高协作者选择的准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型通过中央化的信任语义提取和分布式传递，有效解决了协作设备选择中的效率和准确性挑战。

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

### [4] [Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08222)
*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Wei-jin Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExRAP框架通过探索增强检索和规划，提升LLM在动态环境中的持续指令跟随能力，结合信息探索和时序一致性优化，在多个基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能体在动态非平稳环境中执行持续指令跟随任务时，LLM需要有效探索环境并建立环境上下文记忆来支撑任务规划的问题

Method: 提出探索增强检索规划框架，将指令分解为环境上下文查询和任务执行，集成信息探索到LLM规划过程，采用记忆增强查询评估和时序一致性精化方案

Result: 在VirtualHome、ALFRED和CARLA等基准测试中，对各种指令规模、类型和非平稳度场景都表现出鲁棒性，在目标成功率和执行效率方面均优于现有最先进的LLM任务规划方法

Conclusion: ExRAP框架通过有效平衡环境探索负载和记忆有效性，显著提升了LLM在动态环境中的持续任务执行能力，为具身智能的长期操作提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

### [5] [Real-world Music Plagiarism Detection With Music Segment Transcription System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08282)
*Seonghyeon Go*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合多种音乐信息检索技术的音乐抄袭检测系统，通过提取音乐片段和计算多特征相似度来检测不同格式音乐之间的抄袭行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音乐信息检索技术的发展，音乐生成和分发更加多样化，音乐知识产权保护需求日益增长，需要有效检测音乐抄袭的方法

Method: 开发音乐片段转录系统，从音频录音中提取有音乐意义的片段，基于多个音乐特征计算相似度得分，进行全面的音乐分析

Result: 在音乐抄袭检测实验中显示出有希望的结果，方法可应用于实际音乐场景，并收集了基于真实案例的相似音乐对数据集

Conclusion: 提出的系统能有效检测音乐抄袭，公开的SMP数据集可为音乐相似性研究提供支持

Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR
technologies. We developed a music segment transcription system that extracts
musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive
musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music
plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are
publicly available.

*Binghan Wu,Shoufeng Wang,Yunxin Liu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Joseph Sifakis,Ye Ouyang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过实现Sifakis的自主网络代理架构，在5G RAN中实现了超10ms的实时控制，下行速率提升6%，误码率降低67%，推进L4级自主网络发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超1evel 4自主网络需要从反应式自动化转向真正的认知能力，实现自配置、自恢复、自优化的系统，以满足零等待、零接触、零故障的服务要求。

Method: 采用Joseph Sifakis的AN Agent参考架构，实玹功能性认知系统，部署协调的主动-反应运行时，通过混合知识表示驱动。以RAN链路适配代理为案例研究进行验证。

Result: 在5G NR sub-6 GHz中实现了超10ms的实时控制，下行速率比OLLA算法提高6%，超高可靠服务的块误码率降低67%，通过动态调制编码方案优化。

Conclusion: 该架构能够克服传统自主性的障碍，推进关键的L4级能力开发，向下一代目标前进，验证了该框架在实际运营中的可行性。

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

### [7] [Co-Investigator AI: The Rise of Agentic AI for Smarter, Trustworthy AML Compliance Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08380)
*Prathamesh Vasudeo Naik,Naresh Kumar Dintakurthi,Zhanghao Hu,Yue Wang,Robby Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫Co-Investigator AI的人工智能框架，通过多个专门代理协同工作，大幅提高疑似活动报告(SAR)的生成速度和准确性，解决了传统方法成本高、扩展性低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在反洗钱(AML)工作流中，生成符合监管要求的疑似活动报告(SAR)成本高、扩展性低，而大语言模型存在事实幻觉、犯罪类型对齐差和可解释性差等问题，在遵循关键领域带来不可接受的风险。

Method: 采用自主代理架构，整合了规划、犯罪类型检测、外部情报收集和遵循验证等专门代理，包括动态内存管理、AI隐私保护层和基于Agent-as-a-Judge范式的实时验证代理。保持人类调查员参与，实现协同工作流。

Result: 在多种复杂金融犯罪场景中展示了良好性能，能够流程化SAR草稿编写、对齐监管期望，让遵循团队能够专注于更高阶的分析工作。

Conclusion: 该方法标志着遵循报告新时代的开始，将AI代理的转型效益带到监管过程核心，为可扩展、可靠、透明的SAR生成排除了道路。

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

*Kechen Jiao,Zhirui Fang,Jiahao Liu,Bei Li,Qifan Wang,Xinyu Liu,Junhao Ruan,Zhongjian Qiao,Yifan Zhu,Yaxin Xu,Jingang Wang,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO)方法，通过逐步偏好优化和推理过程对齐，解决视觉语言模型在具身AI决策中的模型退化问题，在ALFWorld环境中实现26.67%的平均成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和思维链的后SFT方法存在稀疏奖励、动作优化限制、样本效率低、一致性差和模型退化等问题，需要更有效的具身决策对齐方法。

Method: 提出TCPO方法：1）逐步偏好优化，将稀疏奖励转为丰富步骤样本对；2）强调中间推理过程对齐；3）引入动作策略一致性约束(APC)对模型输出施加一致性约束。

Result: 在ALFWorld环境中实现26.67%的平均成功率，相比RL4VLM提升6%，有效缓解了微调后的模型退化问题。

Conclusion: TCPO展示了将偏好学习技术与思维链过程结合来增强视觉语言模型在具身智能体中决策能力的潜力，为解决模型退化和提升决策一致性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用LLM评判者之间的逻辑一致性来检测错误评价，通过线性规划计算可能的评估结果，开发无偏差报警机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为评判者时的监督问题，避免无限监控链条，在不知道真实答案的情况下确保评估的可靠性

Method: 利用LLM评判者之间的不一致性来推断评分能力，将逻辑约束形式化为线性规划问题，基于整数响应计数求解

Result: 开发出无知识报警机制，可以在没有偏差的情况下检测出至少一个评判者违反了用户指定的评分能力要求

Conclusion: 通过利用LLM评判者之间的逻辑一致性，可以在不依赖真实标签的情况下有效监测评估错误，为LLM评估提供了可靠的质量控制方法

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

### [10] [Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08682)
*Guoqing Ma,Jia Zhu,Hanghui Guo,Weijie Shi,Jiawei Shen,Jingjiang Liu,Yidan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于多粒度因果推理的多智能体系统故障归因框架，通过性能因果反演原理和CDC-MAS因果发现算法，显著提高了故障定位准确性，实现了36.2%的步骤级准确率和22.4%的任务成功率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在实际部署中面临故障归因的严峻挑战，现有基于统计相关性的诊断工具在Who&When等基准测试中准确率不足15%，无法有效定位故障根本原因步骤。

Method: 1) 性能因果反演原理：通过反转执行日志中的数据流正确建模性能依赖关系，结合Shapley值精确分配智能体级责任；2) CDC-MAS因果发现算法：解决MAS交互数据的非平稳性问题，鲁棒识别关键故障步骤。

Result: 在Who&When和TRAIL基准测试中表现显著提升：步骤级准确率达到36.2%，生成的优化建议使整体任务成功率平均提升22.4%。

Conclusion: 该工作为调试复杂智能体交互提供了原则性和有效的解决方案，为构建更可靠和可解释的多智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 基于双系统理论的心理理论框架，结合图卷积网络（System 1）和元学习（System 2），通过上下文门机制实现直觉与思考的动态平衡，在错误信念任务中验证并模拟人类认知偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一种能够模仿人类双系统思维的AI模型，接近人类社交认知和适应性决策能力，以促进人工智能与认知理论的融合。

Method: 采用图卷积网络（GCNs）实现快速习惯性推理（System 1），通过元学习技术实现慢速上下文敏感学习（System 2），使用学习的上下文门机制动态调节两个系统。

Result: 模型在标准错误信念任务中表现优异，能够模拟锚定效应、认知负荷疲劳、框架效应等人类认知偏见，并在未见上下文中展现出健壮的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该双系统框架有效地模拟了人类适应性行为，为开发具有细腻社交认知能力的AI系统提供了理论基础，推动了AI与认知理论的融合。

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI科学家系统的发展，它们的内部工作流程缺乏详细分析，这可能导致研究输出的整体性、可靠性和可信过受到威胁。需要识别和分析潜在的失败模式以确保AI生成研究的质量。

Method: 设计控制实验来隔离四种潜在失败模式：不适当的基准测试选择、数据泄漏、指标欠使用和后验偏差。对两个知名开源AI科学家系统进行评估，检测这些失败模式的存在和严重程度。

Result: 对两个知名AI科学家系统的评估显示，多个不同严重程度的失败模式存在，这些问题在实践中容易被忽略。证明通过获取完整自动化工作流程的跟踪日志和代码，能够比仅检查最终论文更有效地检测这些失败。

Conclusion: 建议科学期刊和会议在评审AI生成的研究时，要求同时提交完整的自动化工作流程跟踪日志和代码，以确保研究输出的透明度、责任制和可复现性。

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将AI系统的决策能力与故事推理能力结合起来，跨越了这两者之前被分离研究的状态

Method: 采用双系统架构：一个基于过往经验建议行动的RL策略，和一个通过不同故事框架处理建议来指导决策的语言模型，在可配置的gridworld环境中实现

Result: 建立了一个模块化的实验平台，能够进行环境复杂性、故事参数以及RL与故事基于决策互动的受控测试

Conclusion: 该初步实现为研究不同故事框架如何影响奖励基于决策提供了基础，也为探索优化基于学习与符号推理的潜在交互创造了条件

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了埃塞俄比亚南部瓦拉塔语和戈法语的双语语言识别任务，使用BERT预训练模型组合LSTM方法达到了最佳效果，F1分数为0.72。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言社区中，文本常包含多种语言，而瓦拉塔语和戈法语在词汇上存在相似性和差异性，使得语言识别任务很具挑战性。

Method: 采用了多种实验方法，最终选择了基于BERT预训练语言模型与LSTM结构的组合方法。

Result: 在测试集上获得了F1分数0.72的证细率，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究对解决社交媒体上的不良问题有效，并为该领域的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote是一种双层优化方法，通过对抗性超网络训练LLM抵抗恶意微调攻击，在保持模型能力的同时显著提升安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源权重LLM面临恶意微调生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施难以在完全模型访问权限下保护模型安全

Method: 使用辅助对抗性超网络生成恶意LoRA权重，通过双层优化训练防御模型来抵消这些对抗性权重的影响

Result: 在52种红队攻击测试中，AntiDote比基准方法强27.4%，在MMLU等能力基准上性能下降小于0.5%

Conclusion: 该方法为构建安全且实用的开源权重模型提供了计算高效的方法，使安全性成为更内在和弹性的属性

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

### [16] [MVPBench: A Benchmark and Fine-Tuning Framework for Aligning Large Language Models with Diverse Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08022)
*Yao Liang,Dongcheng Zhao,Feifei Zhao,Guobin Shen,Yuwei Wang,Dongqi Liang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MVPBench是一个包含75个国家24,020个实例的基准测试，用于系统评估大语言模型与多维人类价值观的对齐程度，揭示了跨地域和人口统计的显著差异，并证明轻量级微调方法能显著提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽视文化和人口多样性，导致对价值观对齐在全球范围内泛化能力的理解有限，需要更全面的评估资源。

Method: 构建MVPBench基准，包含精细价值标签、个性化问题和丰富人口统计元数据；使用LoRA和DPO等轻量级微调方法进行对齐优化。

Result: 发现最先进LLMs在地理和人口统计线上存在显著对齐性能差异；轻量级微调方法在域内和域外设置中都能显著提升价值对齐效果。

Conclusion: 强调人口感知对齐评估的必要性，为构建文化适应性和价值敏感性LLMs提供可行见解，MVPBench为全球对齐、个性化价值建模和公平AI发展奠定实践基础。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in
other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal
Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust
performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based
reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models
integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information
processing.

TL;DR: SciGPT是基于Qwen3架构的科学领域专用大语言模型，通过领域蒸馏、稀疏专家混合注意力和知识感知适应三大创新，在科学文献理解任务上超越GPT-4o，并显著降低长文档推理内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献呈指数级增长，研究人员需要高效的知识合成工具。通用大语言模型在科学领域存在技术术语理解不足、方法严谨性把握困难等问题，限制了其在跨学科研究中的实用性。

Method: 1. 两阶段低成本领域蒸馏管道平衡性能与效率
2. 稀疏专家混合注意力机制(SMoE)将32,000词长文档推理内存消耗降低55%
3. 知识感知适应整合领域本体以弥合跨学科知识鸿沟

Conclusion: SciGPT验证了其在促进AI增强科学发现方面的潜力，为科学文献理解和知识合成提供了有效的领域专用解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM个性化可能导致错误拒绝请求，但通过系统测试发现模型能力和任务类型对错误拒绝的影响比人物设定更大，人物设定效应可能被高估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型日益个性化，但人物设定提示可能导致模型错误拒绝用户请求，需要量化这种问题的严重程度

Method: 使用15种社会人口统计人物设定，测试16个不同模型在3个任务上的表现，提出蒙特卡洛方法进行样本高效量化

Result: 模型能力越强，人物设定对拒绝率影响越小；某些社会人口统计人物设定会增加错误拒绝，但模型选择和任务类型影响更大

Conclusion: 人物设定效应被高估，错误拒绝可能更多由模型选择和任务敏感性等其他因素导致

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

### [20] [Culturally transmitted color categories in LLMs reflect a learning bias toward efficient compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08093)
*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型能够通过信息瓶颈原则演化出类似人类的高效语义系统，特别是在颜色命名领域，表现出与人类相似的归纳偏好的文化演化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够演化出类似人类的高效语义分类系统，特别是验证它们是否遵循信息瓶颈的复杂度-准确性优化原则，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据中的模式。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.0-flash和Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct模型，复现两个重要的人类行为研究：1）英语颜色命名研究；2）通过上下文语言学习的迭代模拟文化演化过程，测试模型对随机初始系统的优化能力。

Result: Gemini与英语母语者的命名模式高度一致且获得很高的IB效率分数，Llama表现出高效但复杂度较低的系统。两种模型都能通过迭代学习将随机系统重构为更高效的IB系统，并与世界语言模式更加对齐。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型确实能够演化出感知基础的人类化语义系统，其驱动机制与支配人类语言语义效率的基本原理相同，表明LLMs具备人类般的语义系统演化能力。

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略和DoRA权重适配，显著提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力，在AfriMGSM基准上比MindMerger提升12.9个百分点，超越GPT-4o-mini


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangBridge和MindMerger在中高资源语言上表现良好，但在低资源语言(LRLs)上仍存在较大差距，需要开发更有效的跨语言推理方法

Method: 采用两阶段模型堆叠框架，应用从通用双语文本到任务特定数据的课程学习策略，仅适配少量DoRA权重参数

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准上准确率比MindMerger提升+12.9pp，超越GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP上也分别获得+0.9pp和+2.8pp的稳定提升

Conclusion: MERLIN框架在低资源和高资源环境下都表现出有效性，为提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现偏见可以通过提示适应从预训练大语言模型传递到下游模型，且现有提示去偏方法无法一致地阻止偏见传递


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战先前工作中关于偏见不会从预训练LLM传递到适应模型的假设，研究提示适应下的偏见传递现象

Method: 在因果模型框架下研究提示适应中的偏见传递，评估不同少样本组合参数和多种提示去偏策略的效果

Result: 偏见传递相关性很强（rho≥0.94），在不同人口统计特征和任务中表现一致，现有去偏方法效果有限

Conclusion: 需要在内在模型中纠正偏见和改进推理能力，以防止偏见向下游任务传播

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出verbalized algorithms方法，将复杂任务分解为LLM可可靠执行的简单自然语言操作，使用经典算法框架来组织这些操作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性查询LLM方式不可靠，希望通过利用经典算法的理论保证来提升LLM在推理任务中的可靠性

Method: 将任务分解为简单的自然语言字符串基本操作，让LLM只负责这些可靠的小任务，使用已知的经典算法（如双调排序网络）来组织这些操作

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: verbalized algorithms方法通过限制LLM作用范围并利用经典算法框架，能够可靠地完成复杂推理任务

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在需要保留标签多样性的主观任务中，传统的标注者过滤方法往往会错误地移除意见不同的标注者而非真正的垃圾标注者，导致准确性和标签多样性之间的次优权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器学习数据集中如何在过滤垃圾或低质量响应的同时保留数据标签的多样性变化，平衡标注者可靠性和代表性的问题。

Method: 通过实证评估一系列标注者过滤启发式方法对主观任务中变化保留的影响，分析合成垃圾数据上的性能表现。

Result: 发现这些方法通常移除的是意见不同的标注者而非垃圾标注者，保守设置（<5%）的标注者移除效果最佳，大多数垃圾标注者在分布上与真实标注者无法区分。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够考虑标签多样性的垃圾移除方法，因为垃圾标注者往往比非垃圾标注者更不随机，这与现有垃圾过滤方法的直觉相反。

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

Conclusion: 问答方法为评估风格多样文本的语义关系提供了有效视角，并揭示了当前模型在超越表面相似性的信息推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETLCH是一个基于LLaMA的10亿参数模型，通过少量样本微调在结构化数据提取任务中表现出色，证明小模型在资源受限环境下也能实现准确的信息提取


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在结构化数据提取领域部署成本高且需要大量高质量数据，小团队难以承担。目前研究主要关注70亿参数以上的大模型，缺乏小模型在低资源多任务条件下的可靠性证据

Method: 基于LLaMA架构的10亿参数模型，使用低秩适应(LoRA)技术进行微调，每个任务仅使用几百到一千个样本，应用于JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别任务

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上超越了强基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著增益

Conclusion: 经过良好调优的小模型能够以极低的计算成本提供稳定准确的结构化输出，使资源受限环境中的信息提取管道既经济又可靠

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 提出的CommonVoice-SpeechRE数据集和RPG-MoGe框架解决了现有语音关系抽取的数据和模型限制，显著提升了性能，为实际应用提供了有力支持

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Method: 对针对事实核查的对抗性攻击进行深度综述，分类现有攻击方法学并评估其对AFC系统的影响，同时考察最新的对抗感知防御进展

Result: 研究发现现有事实核查系统在面对对抗性操纵时存在严重脆弱性，强调了构建能够保持高验证准确性的韧性框架的紧迫需求

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够抵御对抗性操纵的韧性事实核查框架，以维护信息验证的可靠性，并指出了需要进一步探索的开放研究问题

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型存在否定偏见，与人类调查中的默认同意偏见相反，LLMs倾向于回答"不"


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs受人类生成数据训练且对输入变化敏感，研究者想验证它们是否像人类一样存在默认同意偏见

Method: 在不同模型、任务和语言（英语、德语、波兰语）中研究LLMs的回答倾向

Result: 与人类相反，LLMs显示出偏向回答"不"的偏见，无论这表示同意还是不同意

Conclusion: LLMs表现出与人类不同的系统性回答模式，存在否定回答的偏见

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人物提示方法是否会导致LLM在不同社会群体表征上产生语言抽象度差异，这是刻板印象的一个标志

Method: 基于语言期望偏差框架，分析6个开源LLM在三种提示条件下的输出，比较11个人物驱动响应与通用AI助手的响应，使用具体性、特异性和否定性三个指标测量抽象度

Result: 人物提示在调节语言抽象度方面效果有限，证实了人物作为社会人口群体代表的生态学批评，并引发了对传播刻板印象风险的担忧

Conclusion: 人物提示方法在调节语言抽象度方面存在局限性，即使看似唤起边缘群体声音时仍可能传播刻板印象，需要更谨慎地使用这种方法

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

TL;DR: TrinityX是一个模块化对齐框架，通过混合校准专家(MoCaE)在Transformer架构中分别训练Helpfulness、Harmlessness、Honesty三个维度的专家，使用任务自适应路由机制整合输出，显著提升对齐性能并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；MoE架构存在路由校准不佳的问题，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，包含分别训练的HHH维度专家，通过校准的任务自适应路由机制整合专家信号，形成统一的对齐感知表示。

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中，TrinityX相比基线方法在胜率上提升32.5%，安全分数提升33.9%，真实性提升28.4%，同时内存使用和推理延迟降低40%以上。

Conclusion: TrinityX通过校准路由机制有效解决了多维度对齐问题，具有良好的泛化性和计算效率，为LLM对齐提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

Motivation: 解决现有多语言对齐方法中英语响应质量不高和偏好数据构建偏向性问题，导致噪声多语言偏好数据和对齐性能限制

Method: 设计了一致性基础的数据选择方法(CM-Align)，包括一致性引导的英语参考选择和跨语言一致性基础的多语言偏好数据构建

Result: 在三个大语言模型和三个常见任务上验证了方法的有效性和优势性

Conclusion: 高质量偏好数据的构建对多语言对齐至关重要

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

TL;DR: 本文探索如何利用多个大语言模型的集成方法，在不需要精细调整或标签数据的情况下，实现生物医学问答任务的最新性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学问答面临短语专业知识、大量复杂文档和快速发展的挑战，需要准确的信息检索和知识解释能力。

Method: 采用多个LLM模型（包括Anthropic和Google模型）的集成方法，通过集成多个零射击模型的输出来合成更准确和稳健的答案，结合检索增强生成（RAG）流程。

Result: 在BioASQ挑战任务上，集成方法超过了单个LLM模型的性能，某些情况下甚至可以与领域特定调整系统相竞争或更优。同时发现上下文长度与性能存在关联性。

Conclusion: 集成基于零射击的方法结合有效的RAG流程，为生物医学问答提供了一种实用且可扩展的替代方案，无需成本高昂的精细调整或标签数据。精确的信息检索在RAG方法中仍然至关重要。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在医学领域对训练数据的记忆程度，了解记忆的普遍性、特征、量级和影响，以支持医疗AI的开发和采用。

Method: 系统分析三种适配场景：医学语料续预训练、标准医学测试集微调、真实临床数据微调（包含超13,000份病历），评估记忆的频率、内容和量级。

Result: 记忆现象在所有适配场景中都普遍存在，且比普通领域更为显著。记忆可分为：有益记忆（临床指南等）、无意义记忆（模板化语言）、有害记忆（敏感病人信息）。

Conclusion: 需要采取实践建议来促进有益记忆提升领域知识准确性，减少无意义记忆促进深层学习，减轻有害记忆防止敏感信息泄漏。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Motivation: 现有基于语法树和方面感知注意力的方法难以建模复杂语义关系，线性点积特征无法捕捉非线性关联，导致无关词汇的噪声相似性掩盖关键观点词

Method: OTESGN模型包含语法图感知注意力（挖掘潜在语法依赖和建模全局语法拓扑）和语义最优传输注意力（在文本噪声中发现细粒度语义对齐），通过自适应注意力融合模块整合异构特征，并使用对比正则化提高鲁棒性

Result: 在Twitter数据集上F1分数比之前最佳模型提升1.01%，在Laptop14数据集上提升1.30%，消融研究和可视化分析证实了其在精确定位观点词和抗噪声方面的有效性

Conclusion: OTESGN通过最优传输增强的语法-语义协同注意力机制，有效解决了ABSA任务中复杂语义关系建模和噪声干扰的问题，取得了state-of-the-art的性能

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Motivation: 现有的M2S方法依赖少量手动编写的模板，需要自动化方法来发现和优化更有效的红队测试模板。

Method: 使用语言模型引导的进化框架，结合12个来源的智能采样和LLM作为评判者（受StrongREJECT启发），设置成功阈值θ=0.70进行选择压力。

Result: 获得了5个进化世代、2个新模板家族，在GPT-4.1上达到44.8%总体成功率（103/230）。跨模型测试显示结构增益可转移但随目标变化，发现提示长度与得分正相关。

Conclusion: 结构级搜索是可复现的强化单轮探测方法，强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性，代码和配置已开源。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

Motivation: 传统序列到序列生成要么是离线处理完整输入后才开始输出，要么需要学习复杂的流控制策略。DSM旨在提供更灵活、高效的流式处理方法。

Method: 将流对齐作为预处理步骤，在不同流之间引入适当延迟，使用解码器语言模型处理时间对齐的流数据，支持任意输入组合的流式推理。

Result: 在自动语音识别和文本到语音转换任务上，DSM实现了最先进的性能和延迟，支持任意长序列处理，甚至可与离线基线相媲美。

Conclusion: DSM为多模态序列到序列学习提供了灵活高效的流式处理方案，在保持高性能的同时支持实时应用。

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

TL;DR: 研究发现不同自回归Transformer架构在事实回忆机制上存在显著差异，特别是Qwen模型在早期层中注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆贡献更大，这与GPT等模型的模式不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现针对性模型编辑至关重要。先前研究主要关注GPT风格模型，但不确定这些发现是否适用于不同自回归架构。

Method: 对多个模型（包括GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek）进行事实回忆的全面评估，分析事实信息在何处以及如何被编码和访问。

Result: 发现基于Qwen的模型表现出与先前模式不同的行为：最早层的注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆的贡献更大。

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内部，架构变化也可能导致根本不同的事实回忆机制。

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态无监督环境中，传统方法无法有效评估LLM注释质量，需要一种不依赖于真实标签的评估方法。

Result: 在10个开放域NLP数据集和4个LLM上的实验显示，CAI比率与LLM准确性呈现强正相关关系。

Conclusion: CAI比率是一种有效的无监督评估工具，能够在实际应用场景中进行模型选择和质量评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

TL;DR: 提出了MoVoC方法，将监督形态分析整合到子词词汇中，为吉兹文字语言创建形态感知的分词器，在保持词汇意义的同时保留形态完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子词分词方法在低资源、形态复杂的吉兹文字语言中无法保留形态边界的问题

Method: 结合基于词素和BPE的混合分割方法，构建形态感知的子词词汇表，并为四种吉兹文字语言整理手动标注的词素数据

Result: 在自动翻译质量上没有显著提升，但在内在指标MorphoScore和边界精度上获得一致改进，提高了语言保真度和分词效率

Conclusion: 形态感知分词在增强语言保真度方面具有价值，发布的词素标注数据集和分词器将支持低资源形态丰富语言的进一步研究

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

Motivation: 虽然现有工作主要集中在英语上，但对其他语言如何构建有效的LLM训练语料库仍然存在知识空白。

Method: 采用可扩展的网络数据采集方法，构建8461萄牙语语料库，使用持续预训练设置，并应用语言特定的过滤管道（包括STEM和毒性内容分类器）。

Result: 新建的120B标记葡萄牙语语料库达到了与商业级语料库竞争的结果，适应目标语言的模型导致了性能提升。

Conclusion: 高质量的语言特定数据对LLM性能至关重要，该方法可扩展到其他语言，为多语言LLM开发提供了见解。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在社会科学研究中的实施选择（模型、提示策略、参数设置）会导致系统性偏差和随机错误，造成LLM hacking风险，使得约1/3的假设得出错误结论


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别大语言模型在社会科学研究中自动化数据注释任务时存在的风险，研究人员的实施选择会导致系统性偏差和统计错误

Method: 复现21项已发表社会科学研究中的37个数据注释任务，使用18个不同模型生成1300万个LLM标签，测试2361个实际假设来量化研究选择对统计结论的影响

Result: 约1/3的假设对最先进模型得出错误结论，小模型中一半假设出错；高任务性能和更好模型能力能降低风险，但不能完全消除；效果量越大风险越小；人工注释有助减少偏差，但常见的回归校正技术无效

Conclusion: LLM hacking风险实际存在且严重，故意性LLM hacking极其简单，需要更严格的验证措施和人工注释来减少偏差，对于显著性阈值附近的发现需要特别谨慎

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and

Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在层次细化、跨模态特征整合和噪声适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出XFloodNet框架，包含三个核心组件：分层跨模态门控注意力机制、异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块、级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，实现视觉和文本特征的动态对齐和多粒度交互。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过先进的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，解决了传统方法的局限性，为可持续城市发展提供了有效的洪水检测解决方案。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展视频大语言模型的感知带宽，避免增加上下文窗口带来的计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型在处理更多输入帧以捕捉细粒度时间细节时，面临计算成本过高和长上下文长度导致的性能下降问题。

Method: VPS 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同不重叠子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在 Video-MME 和 EventHallusion 等基准测试中，VPS 在不同模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上均显著提升性能，比 Self-consistency 等其他并行方法扩展性更好。

Conclusion: VPS 提供了一种内存高效且鲁棒的框架，可增强视频大语言模型的时间推理能力，且无需额外训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星高程预测任务提供了有效的基准，证明了特定领域数据集训练的重要性，所有数据和代码均已开源。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应概率匹配损失(APML)，一种完全可微分的一对一匹配近似方法，通过Sinkhorn迭代解决点云预测中传统损失函数的多对一对应问题，具有近二次时间复杂度，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测损失函数(如Chamfer Distance)存在多对一对应问题，导致密集区域点拥堵和稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微操作。EMD虽然能强制一对一对应但计算复杂度高。

Method: 使用Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放相似度矩阵上进行概率匹配，通过分析计算温度值保证最小分配概率，避免手动调参，实现完全可微分和近二次时间复杂度。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成任务中，APML损失实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布(尤其在低密度区域)，以及相当或更好的定量性能。

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种高效、可微分的一对一匹配近似方法，解决了传统点云损失函数的局限性，在多个应用场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Result: 在ISTD数据集上验证了优于RPCANet、DRPCANet和RPCANet++等先进方法的性能

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为致命暴力检测提供了可行的合成数据解决方案，域适应策略有效解决了合成数据与真实数据的差异问题

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers在医学图像分析中的适配问题，因为ViT通常预训练于三通道自然图像，而胸部X光扫描是单通道灰度图像。

Method: 使用通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像转换为三通道格式，使ViT能够充分利用其表征能力，而不引入额外信息损失。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上取得优异表现：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%，均超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略使ViT能够在灰度医学成像任务中充分发挥其表征能力，为TB和肺炎检测建立了新的技术标杆，具有实际临床部署潜力。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Motivation: 现有研究大多基于预训练或忽略了脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要一种能够关注AD引起的结构性不对称变化的诊断方法。

Method: 使用3D CNN编码器提取特征，通过对称交互Transformer(SIT)处理左右半球对齐特征，重点关注脑萎缩引起的不对称区域。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Conclusion: EVDI++框架成功利用事件相机的高时间分辨率特性，有效解决了传统相机长曝光导致的模糊问题，为视频质量提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

Method: 提出HyMamba网络，包含光谱状态集成(SSI)模块和高光谱Mamba(HSM)模块，通过三个方向扫描SSM同步学习空间和光谱信息，构建假彩色和高光谱输入的联合特征

Result: 在7个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱、跨深度和时间建模，有效解决了高光谱目标跟踪中的关键挑战，展现了卓越的性能表现

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

Result: 发现图像特征和提示特定性的微小修改会导致VLM回答方式和整体性能的大幅变化

Conclusion: VLMs对输入参数的微小变化很敏感，需要更好地理解和特征化这些变化以提高模型的稳定性和可靠性

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL通过不确定性估计和动态校准机制有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的过拟合问题，无需为已见和未见数据使用单独分类器，取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有弱监督物体检测方法的三个主要问题：1)伪真实标签框要么只覆盖区别性部位要么无法区分相邻同类实例；2)WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征和分支间语义间隔大；3)忽略建议在优化中被丢弃，导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心技术：1)热力图导向建议选择器(HGPS)算法，利用双门限热力图预选建议；2)弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)，为每个建议增加背景类表征，用热力图进行预监督；3)在忽略建议上应用负确定性监督损失来加速收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上进行了广泛实验，分别达到了58.5%/81.8%和55.6%/80.5%的mAP/mCorLoc分数，表现超过了狭领先的弱监督物体检测方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架通过HGPS、WSBDN咏负确定性监督有效解决了现有弱监督物体检测方法的三个关键问题，在标准数据集上实现了狭领先的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: SimCroP框架能有效捕捉稀疏放射影像中的关键病理结构，提升多尺度下游任务性能

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供实用效率提升

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and
fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby
mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

TL;DR: 通过转换器架构和低码率向量量化，提出了一种自监督的视频动态运动与静态内容解耦表征学习框架，并通过去噪散布模型进行表征学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频数据中动态运动与静态内容的解耦问题，以便进行更好的视频分析和生成任务

Method: 使用转换器架构联合生成帧间软件件动态特征和剧情片段内容特征，通过低码率向量量化作为信息瓶颈促进解耦，并使用去噪散布模型进行自监督表征学习

Result: 在实际说话头像视频上验证了运动转移和自回归运动生成任务的效果，同时也能外推到二维卡通角色等其他类型视频数据

Conclusion: 该方法为自监督解耦视频表征学习提供了新视角，对视频分析和生成领域做出了贡献

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Conclusion: 通过因果损失实现端到端监督，使整个流水线可微分，统一学习过程，使之前不可训练的组件完全可学习

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

TL;DR: 提出垂直残差自编码器(VRAE)用于交通监控图像增强，通过辅助块注入输入感知特征来指导表示学习，相比传统方法显著提升车牌识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实交通监控中，恶劣天气、光照不足或高速运动导致车辆图像严重噪声和模糊，特别是车牌区域较小的情况下，严重影响识别准确率，需要实时图像增强作为预处理步骤

Method: 垂直残差自编码器架构，在每个编码阶段使用辅助块注入输入感知特征来指导表示学习过程，比传统自编码器更好地保持通用信息

Result: 在车牌可见的车辆图像数据集上，相比自编码器(AE)、生成对抗网络(GAN)和基于流的方法(FB)，PSNR提升约20%，NMSE降低约50%，SSIM提升1%，参数仅增加约1%

Conclusion: VRAE架构在交通监控图像增强任务中表现出色，通过输入感知特征注入策略有效提升了图像质量，为车牌识别系统提供了高效的预处理解决方案

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

TL;DR: SCFusion是一个多视角多目标跟踪框架，通过稀疏变换、密度感知加权和多视角一致性损失来解决BEV投影中的特征失真和非均匀密度问题，在WildTrack和MultiviewX数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角多目标跟踪中，传统鸟瞰图(BEV)投影方法存在特征失真和非均匀密度问题，导致检测和跟踪精度下降，需要新的特征融合方法来提高鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SCFusion框架：1)稀疏变换避免投影中的不自然插值；2)密度感知加权基于空间置信度和相机距离自适应融合特征；3)多视角一致性损失鼓励每个相机在融合前学习判别性特征。

Result: 在WildTrack数据集上达到95.9%的IDF1分数，在MultiviewX数据集上达到89.2%的MODP分数，超越了基准方法TrackTacular。

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影的限制，为多视角目标检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，需要更有效的解释方法。

Method: 使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，降低计算成本。

Result: 在三个视频数据集上优于现有方法，R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE是向安全关键领域可信AI部署迈出的重要一步，提供了有价值的模型行为洞察。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化高光谱数据集、光谱-空间Transformer分类器和轻量级测试时自适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在多样化退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建包含9种代表性退化的多退化高光谱数据集；2) 设计带有多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化的光谱-空间Transformer分类器；3) 提出置信度感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)进行轻量级测试时自适应。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在广泛的退化场景中优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA提供了一个统一的框架，能够在不访问源数据或目标标注的情况下，实现鲁棒且动态的自适应，有效解决了高光谱图像分类中的分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

Conclusion: SBDM为直观皮层发育假设场景探索提供了新的框架，在神经退行性疾病早期识别和个体化干预方面具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

Result: 在5个标准数据集上验证，FSSM在不增加参数的情况下提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前轻量级SR方法，达到了最先进水平

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM计算过程有效提升了轻量级超分辨模型的性能，为SSM在计算机视觉领域的应用提供了新的研究方向

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频幻觉基准过于依赖人工分类，忽略了人类自然解释视频的感知过程，需要更系统化的评估方法。

Method: 使用问答框架(二元和多选题)，包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上方法评估基本对象、粗到细的主题特征以及主题-动作对。

Result: LVMs在识别基本对象和特征方面表现优异，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主题的多个动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加。

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的方法来识别视频中的幻觉，揭示了LVMs在复杂场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

TL;DR: 提出了MMB方法，通过贝叶斯提示集成和图像聚类来改善多模态大语言模型在文本到图像生成评估中的偏见和校准问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型作为评估工具存在偏见、过度自信和在不同图像领域表现不一致的问题，标准提示集成方法在文本到图像任务中效果不佳

Method: 提出了多模态贝叶斯提示集成方法(MMB)，结合贝叶斯提示集成和图像聚类，根据样本的视觉特征动态分配提示权重

Result: 在HPSv2和MJBench两个基准测试中，MMB在配对偏好判断准确性、与人类标注对齐以及校准方面优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 多模态特定的策略对于评估模型校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模文本到图像评估提供了有前景的路径

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Conclusion: HuMo通过创新的数据集构建、训练策略和推理方法，成功实现了多模态输入的协同控制，为人类中心视频生成提供了有效的统一解决方案

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态眼科图像获取成本高，底示照相但OCT数据稀缺，传统方法无法抓取细粒度空间信息。需要解决模态不平衡问题并利用OCT的空间先验知识来提升底示图像识别性能。

Method: 通过对比学习在大量非配对OCT和底示图像上进行训练，同时学习OCT潜在空间中的疾病易发部位矩阵。在仅使用底示图像的分类任务中，利用该矩阵辅助分类学习。

Result: 在9个多样化数据集上进行的实验显示，该框架在28个关键病种上超过了现有的基准方法。

Conclusion: UOPSL框架能够有效利用OCT的空间先验知识来提升底示图像的疾病识别性能，解决了多模态数据获取成本高和模态不平衡的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Method: 采用多视角数据集，通过随机选择24个视角（选择向量）学习视角不变嵌入，并尝试使用所有5个高度级别的120个视角（选择矩阵）进行随机选择

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务中均获得第一名

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升植物表型分析的准确性，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的重要方向

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Conclusion: 双参考系双流架构能有效解耦手势形态和轨迹信息，为解决手语识别中的几何模糊性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Motivation: 多模态模型在医学图像分割中表现不佳，主要因为抽象文本提示与细粒度医学视觉特征之间存在显著语义间隔，导致特征分散问题。

Method: 提出期望最大化(EM)聚合机制动态聚类特征成紧凑语义中心，以减少特征分散；设计文本导向像素解码器，利用领域不变文本知识引导深度视觉表征来缩小语义间隔。

Conclusion: 通过语义聚合的角度重新考虑多模态融合问题，EM聚合机制和文本导向像素解码器的协同作用显著提升了模型的永生性能力。

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Result: Swin Transformer模型表现最优（86%准确率），可解释性技术确认模型关注病变区域，外部验证表现良好

Conclusion: 深度学习框架能够实现无侵入、易获得和可解释的碳中毒性皮肤病诊断，适用于资源有限的农村地区进行早期精细识别

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注获取困难。本文旨在开发无监督框架，直接从连续灰度帧学习，解决高分辨率数据和标注有限场景下的光流估计问题。

Method: 提出分形变形网络(FDN)，采用递归编码器-解码器结构，利用分形几何和自相似性原理。训练目标基于变分公式，结合L1/L2数据保真度和总变差正则化，确保亮度恒定性和空间平滑性。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功实现了无监督光流估计，分形网络结构和变分正则化的结合有效提升了光流估计的准确性和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges
due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns.
Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a
systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that
leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved
coastal water segmentation. Our approach integrates five synergistic
components: HSV-guided color supervision, gradient-based coastline
optimization, morphological post-processing, sea area cleanup, and connectivity
control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent
improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational
efficiency. For reproducibility, our training configurations and code are

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV
systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high
dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare
mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth
estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By
analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,
and efficiency in real-world scenarios, such as autonomous navigation,
surveillance, augmented reality, and robotics.

Motivation: 多模态大模型都署需要大量计算资源，在资源受限环境中遇到挑战，需要发展轻量化高性能模型以满足实际应用需求

Method: 提出BreezeCLIP视觉-语言编码器，构建端到端的轻量MLLM框架BcQLM，采用模块化可扩展设计

Result: 在多个数据集上验证有效性，仅用1.2亿参数却能达到标准大小MLLM的性能水平，显著降低计算成本

Conclusion: BcQLM为实际硬件约束下的MLLM部署提供了有前景的解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Motivation: 现有密度图定义通常依赖于头部位置或基于物体的空间统计，需要扩展定义以包含边界框维度信息，并利用密度信息改进拥挤场景下的检测

Method: 提出CQ模块预测物体密度图并嵌入密度信息到解码器中，使用密度引导的查询来改进检测。设计了CQ2D和CQ3D架构，可集成到通用transformer检测器中

Result: 在STCrowd数据集上相比基础模型有显著性能提升，优于大多数SOTA方法。在CrowdHuman数据集上集成到SOTA检测器后能进一步提升性能

Conclusion: CQ方法有效桥接了2D和3D拥挤环境检测，具有通用性和可扩展性，无需额外数据即可提升检测性能

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法只能依赖合成先验，产生不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Motivation: 解决事件相机在星迹定向中真实值准确性验证的挑战

Method: 通过静态指向夜空的事件相机系统，采集地球自转引起的星迹数据，与IERS测量的地球方位进行对比

Result: 实现了18.47秒的RMS错差和78.84秒的绝对错差，达到秒级准确度

Conclusion: 事件相机具备低成本、低延迟星迹定向的潜力，给出了开源代码和数据

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，显著提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放时，相邻源位置的对应点可能分布广泛，单一假设容易导致错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建了BEAMER架构，学习在尺度间保持和传播多个假设。

Result: BEAMER相比最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过预测和传播多个对应假设而不是单一假设，可以显著提高密集图像匹配在挑战性场景下的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

Motivation: 现有视觉生成奖励模型存在架构限制和Bradley-Terry损失与VLM不匹配的问题，且RLHF优化过程存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了奖励模型的规模化发展。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表示生成图像优于参考图像，从而内在对齐VLM架构。支持模型规模扩展和上下文扩展（任务指令、参考示例、思维链推理）。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法，大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了奖励黑客问题，缓解了小模型中的模式崩溃问题，为视觉生成奖励模型的规模化发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Conclusion: 该方法在单目RGB视频的3D织物重建和外观估计方面取得了显著进展，为动态场景的物理渲染提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: Microservices architectures have become the foundation for developing
scalable and modern software systems, but they also bring significant
challenges in managing heterogeneous and distributed data. The pragmatic
solution is polyglot persistence, the deliberate use of several different
database technologies adapted to a given microservice requirement - is one such
strategy. This paper examines polyglot persistence in microservice based
systems. This paper brings together theoretical concepts with evidence from
practical implementations and comparative benchmarks of standard database
platforms. A comparative framework is applied to relational, document,
key-value, column-family and graph databases to assess scalability,
consistency, query expressiveness, operational overhead and integration ease.
Empirical data drawn from industry case studies such as Netflix, Uber, and
Shopify, and survey data illustrate real-life adoption trends and challenges.
These findings demonstrate that polyglot persistence increases adaptability ,
performance , domain alignment but also governance or operational complexity.
To cope with such trade-offs, architectural patterns such as saga workflows,
event sourcing, and outbox integration are discussed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种个性化w-事件隐私保护方案PBD和PBA，在满足不同用户隐私需求的同时提高了数据流估计的准确性，锐减了误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的w-事件隐私研究主要关注同质化隐私需求，而实际应用中不同用户可能有不同的隐私保护需求，需要个性化的隐私保护方案。

Method: 设计了个性化窗口大小机制(PWSM)，以及两种解决方案：个性化预算分配(PBD)和个性化预算吸收(PBA)。PBD为下一时间步供给至少上一次消耗的隐私预算，PBA则从前k个时间槽吸收隐私预算并借用后k个时间槽的预算来增加当前时间槽的隐私预算。

Conclusion: 个性化w-事件隐私保护方案能够在满足不同用户隐私需求的前提下，显著提高数据流估计的准确性，为流数据隐私保护提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Streaming data collection is indispensable for stream data analysis, such as
event monitoring. However, publishing these data directly leads to privacy
leaks. $w$-event privacy is a valuable tool to protect individual privacy
within a given time window while maintaining high accuracy in data collection.
Most existing $w$-event privacy studies on infinite data stream only focus on
homogeneous privacy requirements for all users. In this paper, we propose
personalized $w$-event privacy protection that allows different users to have
different privacy requirements in private data stream estimation. Specifically,
we design a mechanism that allows users to maintain constant privacy
requirements at each time slot, namely Personalized Window Size Mechanism
(PWSM). Then, we propose two solutions to accurately estimate stream data
statistics while achieving $w$-event level $\epsilon$ personalized differential
privacy ( ($w$, $\epsilon$)-EPDP), namely Personalized Budget Distribution
(PBD) and Peronalized Budget Absorption (PBA). PBD always provides at least the
same privacy budget for the next time step as the amount consumed in the
previous release. PBA fully absorbs the privacy budget from the previous $k$
time slots, while also borrowing from the privacy budget of the next $k$ time
slots, to increase the privacy budget for the current time slot. We prove that
both PBD and PBA outperform the state-of-the-art private stream estimation
methods while satisfying the privacy requirements of all users. We demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our PBD and PBA on both real and synthetic
data sets, compared with the recent uniformity $w$-event approaches, Budget
Distribution (BD) and Budget Absorption (BA). Our PBD achieves 68% less error
than BD on average on real data sets. Besides, our PBA achieves 24.9% less
error than BA on average on synthetic data sets.

Conclusion: SINDI有效解决了稀疏向量MIPS的性能瓶颈，已被集成到蚂蚁集团开源向量搜索库VSAG中，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: Sparse vector Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is crucial in multi-path
retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Recent inverted index-based
and graph-based algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical
efficiency. However, their performance in production environments is often
limited by redundant distance computations and frequent random memory accesses.
Furthermore, the compressed storage format of sparse vectors hinders the use of
SIMD acceleration. In this paper, we propose the sparse inverted non-redundant
distance index (SINDI), which incorporates three key optimizations: (i)
Efficient Inner Product Computation: SINDI leverages SIMD acceleration and
eliminates redundant identifier lookups, enabling batched inner product
computation; (ii) Memory-Friendly Design: SINDI replaces random memory accesses
to original vectors with sequential accesses to inverted lists, substantially
reducing memory-bound latency. (iii) Vector Pruning: SINDI retains only the
high-magnitude non-zero entries of vectors, improving query throughput while
maintaining accuracy. We evaluate SINDI on multiple real-world datasets.

Motivation: 传统相似性评估方法无法有效处理知识库中的矛盾，需要一种能够显式整合矛盾、提供更鲁棒和可解释的相似性度量的框架

Method: 引入次协调超类别Ξ_K*来层次化组织知识实体，定义新的相似性度量S*，包含矛盾提取器E和修复机制来确保评估一致性

Result: 理论结果保证了S*的自反性、对称性和有界性，为处理冲突知识提供了有效解决方案

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体系统中的知识管理提供了有前景的解决方案，能够更好地处理知识库中的不一致性问题

Abstract: This article proposes a paraconsistent framework for evaluating similarity in
knowledge bases. Unlike classical approaches, this framework explicitly
integrates contradictions, enabling a more robust and interpretable similarity
measure. A new measure $ S^* $ is introduced, which penalizes inconsistencies
while rewarding shared properties. Paraconsistent super-categories $ \Xi_K^* $
are defined to hierarchically organize knowledge entities. The model also
includes a contradiction extractor $ E $ and a repair mechanism, ensuring
consistency in the evaluations. Theoretical results guarantee reflexivity,
symmetry, and boundedness of $ S^* $. This approach offers a promising solution
for managing conflicting knowledge, with perspectives in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: SQL queries in real world analytical environments, whether written by humans
or generated automatically often suffer from syntax errors, inefficiency, or
semantic misalignment, especially in complex OLAP scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose SQLGovernor, an LLM powered SQL toolkit that unifies
multiple functionalities, including syntax correction, query rewriting, query
modification, and consistency verification within a structured framework
enhanced by knowledge management. SQLGovernor introduces a fragment wise
processing strategy to enable fine grained rewriting and localized error
correction, significantly reducing the cognitive load on the LLM. It further
incorporates a hybrid self learning mechanism guided by expert feedback,
allowing the system to continuously improve through DBMS output analysis and
rule validation. Experiments on benchmarks such as BIRD and BIRD CRITIC, as
well as industrial datasets, show that SQLGovernor consistently boosts the
performance of base models by up to 10%, while minimizing reliance on manual
expertise. Deployed in production environments, SQLGovernor demonstrates strong
practical utility and effective performance.

Motivation: LLM服务需要充分利用异构硬件资源，但现有并行化方法在异构环境中扩展效率低下，存在内存容量与计算能力不匹配、不同LLM模块性能差距等问题

Method: 采用细粒度动态并行化设计：选择性并行化计算密集型操作降低延迟；以head粒度动态分配Attention计算到低端GPU；在线负载调度策略平衡网络延迟、计算负载和内存强度

Result: 评估结果显示，Hetis相比现有系统能够将服务吞吐量提升最多2.25倍，延迟降低1.49倍

Conclusion: Hetis通过创新的细粒度动态并行化方法有效解决了异构GPU集群中LLM服务的效率问题，显著提升了系统性能

Abstract: The significant resource demands in LLM serving prompts production clusters
to fully utilize heterogeneous hardware by partitioning LLM models across a mix
of high-end and low-end GPUs. However, existing parallelization approaches
often struggle to scale efficiently in heterogeneous environments due to their
coarse-grained and static parallelization strategies.
  In this paper, we introduce Hetis, a new LLM system tailored for
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Hetis addresses two critical challenges: (1) memory
inefficiency caused by the mismatch between memory capacity and computational
power in heterogeneous devices, and (2) computational inefficiency arising from
performance gaps across different LLM modules. To tackle these issues, Hetis
employs a fine-grained and dynamic parallelism design. Specifically, it
selectively parallelizes compute-intensive operations to reduce latency and
dynamically distributes Attention computations to low-end GPUs at a head
granularity, leveraging the distinct characteristics of each module.
Additionally, Hetis features an online load dispatching policy that
continuously optimizes serving performance by carefully balancing network
latency, computational load, and memory intensity. Evaluation results
demonstrate that Hetis can improve serving throughput by up to $2.25\times$ and
reduce latency by $1.49\times$ compared to existing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦图学习(DFGL)通过P2P通信避免了参数服务器瓶颈，但图节点嵌入的跨工作节点通信带来了巨大通信开销。现有方法单独使用稀疏拓扑或图采样，但直接组合会导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出Duplex框架，通过考虑网络拓扑和图采样的耦合关系进行联合优化。引入学习驱动算法自适应确定最优网络拓扑和图形采样比例，应对统计异构性和动态网络环境挑战。

Result: 实验结果显示，Duplex将完成时间减少20.1%-48.8%，通信成本降低16.7%-37.6%，在相同资源预算下准确率提高3.3%-7.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex通过联合优化网络拓扑和图形采样，有效解决了DFGL中的通信效率问题，在降低通信成本的同时提升了训练性能，适用于实际部署环境。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Graph Learning (DFGL) overcomes potential bottlenecks
of the parameter server in FGL by establishing a peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication network among workers. However, while extensive cross-worker
communication of graph node embeddings is crucial for DFGL training, it
introduces substantial communication costs. Most existing works typically
construct sparse network topologies or utilize graph neighbor sampling methods
to alleviate the communication overhead in DFGL. Intuitively, integrating these
methods may offer promise for doubly improving communication efficiency in
DFGL. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly combining
these methods leads to significant training performance degradation if they are
jointly optimized. To address this issue, we propose Duplex, a unified
framework that jointly optimizes network topology and graph sampling by
accounting for their coupled relationship, thereby significantly reducing
communication cost while enhancing training performance in DFGL. To overcome
practical DFGL challenges, eg, statistical heterogeneity and dynamic network
environments, Duplex introduces a learning-driven algorithm to adaptively
determine optimal network topologies and graph sampling ratios for workers.
Experimental results demonstrate that Duplex reduces completion time by
20.1%--48.8% and communication costs by 16.7%--37.6% to achieve target
accuracy, while improving accuracy by 3.3%--7.9% under identical resource
budgets compared to baselines.

Motivation: 流形可以表示真实世界测量数据的复杂拓扑空间，可视化流形有助于展示拓扑特征（如曲率）并揭示底层数据的重要属性（如测量异常）。互联网延迟测量数据需要有效的可视化方法来理解网络连接特性

Conclusion: 通过两个案例研究（简单示例展示关键概念，美国公共互联网可视化）证明了Matisse的实用性，该方法能有效可视化互联网延迟数据的拓扑特性

Abstract: Manifolds are complex topological spaces that can be used to represent
datasets of real-world measurements. Visualizing such manifolds can help with
illustrating their topological characteristics (e.g., curvature) and providing
insights into important properties of the underlying data (e.g., anomalies in
the measurements). In this paper, we describe a new methodology and system for
generating and visualizing manifolds that are inferred from actual Internet
latency measurements between different cities and are projected over a 2D
Euclidean space (e.g., a geographic map). Our method leverages a series of
graphs that capture critical information contained in the data, including
well-defined locations (for vertices) and Ricci curvature information (for
edges). Our visualization approach then generates a curved surface (manifold)
in which (a) geographical locations of vertices are maintained and (b) the
Ricci curvature values of the graph edges determine the curvature properties of
the manifold. The resulting manifold highlights areas of critical connectivity
and defines an instance of "Internet delay space" where latency measurements
manifest as geodesics. We describe details of our method and its implementation
in a tool, which we call Matisse, for generating, visualizing and manipulating
manifolds projected onto a base map. We illustrate Matisse with two case
studies: a simple example to demonstrate key concepts, and visualizations of
the US public Internet to show Matisse's utility.

Abstract: Proliferation of new classes of airspace participants, including uncrewed and
advanced aerial mobility vehicles, necessitates the development and deployment
of novel airspace management solutions, such as the Unmanned Traffic Management
(UTM) system and the Provider of Services to UAM (PSU) Network. The efficacy of
such systems has been demonstrated on multiple occasions via real-world
deployments in limited test environments, however exploration of system
behavior under stressing conditions requires the development of appropriate
modeling and simulation (M&S) environments. Autonomy Networks for Advanced
Mobility at Lincoln Laboratory (ANAMLL) is a virtual Systems Integration
Laboratory (SIL) designed to host federated autonomy networks, such as a UTM or
PSU Network, and to enable test and validation at scales not available in
real-world deployments. As an example of ANAMLL's utility, we explore the
performance of a representative UTM network during a stressing demand scenario.
In a close examination of the demand scenario, ANAMLL demonstrates a UTM system

Abstract: Low-speed internet can negatively affect incident response in a number of
ways, including decreased teamwork, delayed detection, inefficient action, and
elevated risk. Delayed data acquisition and processing may result from
inadequate internet connectivity, hindering security teams' ability to obtain
the necessary information for timely and effective responses. Each of these
factors may augment the organization's susceptibility to security incidents and
their subsequent ramifications. This article establishes a virtual network
function service delivery network (VNFSDN) through the integration of virtual
network function (VNF) and software-defined networking (SDN) technologies. The
VNFSDN approach enhances network security effectiveness and efficiency while
reducing the danger of breaches. This method assists security services in
rapidly assessing vast quantities of data generated by 6G networks. VNFSDN
adapts dynamically to changing safety requirements and connection conditions
through the use of SDN and VNF. This flexibility enables enterprises to
mitigate or halt the impact of cyberattacks by swiftly identifying and
addressing security threats. The VNFSDN enhances network resilience, allowing
operators to proactively mitigate possible security attacks and minimize
downtime. The incorporation of machine learning and artificial intelligence
into VNFSDN can significantly improve network security and threat detection
capabilities. The VNFSDN integrates VNF and SDN technologies to deliver
security services that analyze vast quantities of 6G data in real time. As
security requirements and network conditions evolve, it adapts dynamically to

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO卫星网络的高移动性、动态流量模式和潜在链路故障对高效弹性路由提出了重大挑战，需要解决传统方法在可扩展性和实时响应方面的不足。

Method: 将LEO卫星网络建模为时变图，提出SKYLINK分布式学习策略，使每个卫星能独立实时决策流量分发，适应时变网络条件。

Result: 相比弯管方法降低加权平均延迟和丢包率29%，相比Dijkstra降低92%；丢包率相比k最短路径降低95%，相比Dijkstra降低99%，吞吐量提升46%。

Conclusion: SKYLINK在保证实时响应性、可扩展性和网络弹性的同时，显著提升了LEO卫星网络的性能表现，计算复杂度与星座规模无关。

Abstract: The rapid growth of space-based services has established LEO satellite
networks as a promising option for global broadband connectivity.
Next-generation LEO networks leverage inter-satellite links (ISLs) to provide
faster and more reliable communications compared to traditional bent-pipe
architectures, even in remote regions. However, the high mobility of
satellites, dynamic traffic patterns, and potential link failures pose
significant challenges for efficient and resilient routing. To address these
challenges, we model the LEO satellite network as a time-varying graph
comprising a constellation of satellites and ground stations. Our objective is
to minimize a weighted sum of average delay and packet drop rate. Each
satellite independently decides how to distribute its incoming traffic to
neighboring nodes in real time. Given the infeasibility of finding optimal
solutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and
uncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed
learning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK
enables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions,
ensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and
resilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead
and computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global
scale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For
25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop
rate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to
Dijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99%
relative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while
achieving up to 46% higher throughput. At the same time, SKYLINK maintains
constant computational complexity with respect to constellation size.

TL;DR: 基于SX1280 LoRa逆变器的能源效率优化定位框架，通过同步醒醒窗口减少能耗，在保持精确定位的同时实现了一个碳电池便可使用9个月的长寿命


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IoT应用中对精确定位和长寿命能源的双重需求，尤其在大规模部署中面临的能源管理挑战

Method: 设计了一个协调框架，通过简短的同步醒醒窗口来管理设备的睡眠-醒来协调，减少对精确连续时间的依赖并减轻低成本振荡器的偏移

Result: 实验结果显示，节点可以在超低功耗模式下工作，周期性醒来检查指令，在单个碳电池上实现了达到9个月的宅机时间，同时保持了距离计算在5米以内的精度

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了SX1280 LoRa逆变器在实际应用中的能源管理问题，为大规模IoT部署提供了一个经济高效的精确定位解决方案

Abstract: Precise and energy-efficient localization is a critical requirement in many
Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly in large-scale deployments
such as asset tagging, agriculture, and smart cities, where long battery life
and cost-effectiveness are crucial. The Semtech SX1280 LoRa transceiver
presents a promising solution for IoT localization. It combines low cost, low
power, and precise ranging capability over distances of up to 1 km. However,
the ranging process requires two devices to be simultaneously active, one
initiating the ranging request and the other responding to it, which can lead
to significant energy expenditure if not properly managed. Despite the
transceiver's excellent performance, no existing system-level framework
effectively manages sleep-wake coordination and role assignment needed for
energy-efficient operation. This paper presents a coordination framework that
significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining the inherent precise
ranging capability of the chip. The framework schedules short, synchronized
wake-up windows between the initiator and the responder, allowing devices to
remain in deep sleep for most of their duty cycle. This scheduling strategy
minimizes reliance on precise continuous timing and mitigates drift in low-cost
oscillators. To validate the framework, we designed and developed custom nodes
that are compliant with the framework's protocol. Experimental results show
that the proposed approach allows a node to stay in ultra-low power mode and
wake periodically to check for instructions. The node can remain in standby
mode for up to nine months on a single coin cell battery and can perform
ranging operations on demand in near real-time, all while maintaining a
localization accuracy within five meters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在实际系统中产生符合规范、可解析输出的需求，通过结构化提示控制LLM输出格式和内容。

Method: 建立XML树的完全格结构，形式化单调提示到提示运算符的最小固定点定理，结合上下文自由语法保证输出的良形成性，并提供多层人工智能交互方案。

Result: 证明了在精细顺序下单调运算符存在最小固定点，并在任务意义收缩度量下证明迭代指导的收敛性，通过语法约束解码确保了输出的良形成性且保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个数学上完整的框架，将XML结构化提示与语法约束解码、验证链和程序化提示等最新进展结合起来，为实际部署提供了多层人工智能交互方案。

Abstract: Structured prompting with XML tags has emerged as an effective way to steer
large language models (LLMs) toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in
real-world systems. We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that
unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over
lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction
loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order
and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points
(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware
contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of
iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars
(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees
well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer
human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,
including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool
use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent
advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic
prompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代系统软件负责安全关键功能，需要快速迭代和持续交付新功能，但软件开发与安全工程的方法和工具存在脱节

Method: 提出建立安全工厂，通过：1）使用语义丰富的可机器处理模型捕获安全工作产品；2）定义自动一致性检查；3）自动生成文档

Result: 论文提出了一种将软件开发最佳实践转移到安全工程的方法论，但未提供具体实验结果

Conclusion: 需要在前期投入更多形式化工作，通过安全工厂的概念来缩小软件开发与安全工程间的流程差距，以支持高速软件发展

Abstract: Modern cyber-physical systems are operated by complex software that
increasingly takes over safety-critical functions. Software enables rapid
iterations and continuous delivery of new functionality that meets the
ever-changing expectations of users. As high-speed development requires
discipline, rigor, and automation, software factories are used. These entail
methods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and
pipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge
the disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety
engineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing
safety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable,
defining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of
documentation - to benefit later. Transferring best practices from software to
safety engineering is worth exploring. We advocate for safety factories, which
integrate safety tooling and methods into software development pipelines.

Motivation: 软件工程领域以男性为主，研究团队多样性对机会平等、生产力和创新的影响，尤其是在教育环境中评估性别和国籍多样性的作用。

Method: 分析51个团队在3个学术年度的效能，使用性别、国籍和其共同存在的三种多样性指数，通过统计分析研究不同多样性维度对团队项目质量的影响。

Result: 性别多样性与项目成功呈现中等正相关关系；国籍多样性对项目结果有轻微负面影响；性别与国籍多样性组合时产生负面影响，可能因为沟通障碍和文化差异增加。

Conclusion: 在教育环境中推进团队多样性不会对学生表现和教育目标完成产生负面影响，应考虑多种多样性维度及其互动作用。

Abstract: Software Engineering is mostly a male-dominated sector, where gender
diversity is a key feature for improving equality of opportunities,
productivity, and innovation. Other diversity aspects, including but not
limited to nationality and ethnicity, are often understudied.In this work we
aim to assess the impact of team diversity, focusing mainly on gender and
nationality, in the context of an agile software development project-based
course. We analyzed 51 teams over three academic years, measuring three
different Diversity indexes - regarding Gender, Nationality and their
co-presence - to examine how different aspects of diversity impact the quality
of team project outcomes.Statistical analysis revealed a moderate,
statistically significant correlation between gender diversity and project
success, aligning with existing literature. Diversity in nationality showed a
negative but negligible effect on project results, indicating that promoting
these aspects does not harm students' performance. Analyzing their co-presence
within a team, gender and nationality combined had a negative impact, likely
due to increased communication barriers and differing cultural norms.This study
underscores the importance of considering multiple diversity dimensions and
their interactions in educational settings. Our findings, overall, show that
promoting diversity in teams does not negatively impact their performance and
achievement of educational goals.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers
from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods
or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context,
expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions
through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic
execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor
encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing
the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic
Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the
function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow
the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,
enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We
demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with
over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer
language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software
testing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球科研评价系统改革缺乏宏观系统的评价理论指导，定性与定量评价方法存在二元对立问题，需要突破性理论框架来解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 通过回顾科研评价历史发展，分析当前评价实践中定性与定量方法的二元对立问题，提出整合形、内容和效用评价的三维度框架SAER，结合六大关键要素构建系统性评价体系。

Result: SAER框架成功超越了定性与定量评价的二元对立，为学术评价者和研究人员提供了协调评价方法的综合基础，展现了中国科研评价理论中的辨证智慧。

Conclusion: 该研究为全球科研评价系统的改革与发展提供了重要的理论支撑和参考价值，SAER框架有助于推动科研评价体系的系统性变革和全面发展。

Abstract: The lack of a macro-level, systematic evaluation theory to guide the
implementation of evaluation practices has become a key bottleneck in the
reform of global research evaluation systems. By reviewing the historical
development of research evaluation, this paper highlights the current binary
opposition between qualitative and quantitative methods in evaluation
practices. This paper introduces the System of All-round Evaluation of Research
(SAER), a framework that integrates form, content, and utility evaluations with
six key elements. SAER offers a theoretical breakthrough by transcending the
binary, providing a comprehensive foundation for global evaluation reforms. The
comprehensive system proposes a trinity of three evaluation dimensions,
combined with six evaluation elements, which would help academic evaluators and
researchers reconcile binary oppositions in evaluation methods. The system
highlights the dialectical wisdom and experience embedded in Chinese research
evaluation theory, offering valuable insights and references for the reform and
advancement of global research evaluation systems.

Motivation: 解决软件工程中配置空间庞大、标注成本高、传统优化方法缺乏可解释性的问题

Method: 基于朴素贝叶斯采样的主动学习策略，结合最大清晰度启发式方法，使用决策树提供全局和局部解释

Result: 在60个真实数据集上，EZR在大多数情况下达到超过90%的最佳优化性能，解释清晰度和实用性优于LIME、SHAP等标准XAI方法

Conclusion: "少而精"的策略可行且更优，使用更少但信息更丰富的样本可以实现标签高效的优化和解释

Abstract: Efficient, interpretable optimization is a critical but underexplored
challenge in software engineering, where practitioners routinely face vast
configuration spaces and costly, error-prone labeling processes. This paper
introduces EZR, a novel and modular framework for multi-objective optimization
that unifies active sampling, learning, and explanation within a single,
lightweight pipeline. Departing from conventional wisdom, our Maximum Clarity
Heuristic demonstrates that using less (but more informative) data can yield
optimization models that are both effective and deeply understandable. EZR
employs an active learning strategy based on Naive Bayes sampling to
efficiently identify high-quality configurations with a fraction of the labels
required by fully supervised approaches. It then distills optimization logic
into concise decision trees, offering transparent, actionable explanations for
both global and local decision-making. Extensive experiments across 60
real-world datasets establish that EZR reliably achieves over 90% of the
best-known optimization performance in most cases, while providing clear,
cohort-based rationales that surpass standard attribution-based explainable AI
(XAI) methods (LIME, SHAP, BreakDown) in clarity and utility. These results
endorse "less but better"; it is both possible and often preferable to use
fewer (but more informative) examples to generate label-efficient optimization
and explanations in software systems. To support transparency and
reproducibility, all code and experimental materials are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在自动化Gym环境设置过程中成功率低、开销大，而合成新任务又无法利用大量真实的人类报告问题。需要最大化利用现有Gym环境和GitHub上的issue解决历史数据。

Method: 引入SWE-Mirror管道，提取真实issue的语义本质，将其镜像到配置了Gym环境的另一个仓库中，并重新激活为可验证的issue解决任务。

Result: 在4种语言的40个仓库中构建了60,671个任务的数据集。训练后的模型在issue解决能力上表现出改进，7B模型在SWE-Bench-Verified上的解决率提升+21.8%，32B模型提升+46.0%。

Conclusion: SWE-Mirror成功构建了大规模可验证数据集，验证了方法的有效性，并在OpenHands代理框架上建立了基于Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLMs的新SOTA性能。

Abstract: Creating large-scale verifiable training datasets for issue-resolving tasks
is a critical yet notoriously difficult challenge. Existing methods on
automating the Gym environment setup process for real-world issues suffer from
low success rates and high overhead. Meanwhile, synthesizing new tasks within
existing Gym environments leaves the vast pool of authentic, human-reported
problems untapped. To maximize the utilization of existing Gym environments and
also the rich data of issue-resolving history on GitHub, we introduce
SWE-Mirror, a pipeline that distills a real-world issue's semantic essence,
mirrors it into another repository with a configured Gym environment, and
re-animates it as a verifiable issue-resolving task. SWE-Mirror reuses existing
Gym environments along with the vast pool of issue-resolving history hosted on
GitHub to construct a large-scale dataset of mirrored authentic and verifiable
tasks. Applying SWE-Mirror to 40 repositories across 4 languages, we have
curated a dataset with 60,671 issue-resolving tasks and demonstrated the value
of our dataset by training and evaluating coding agents at various scale.
Post-training experiments show that models trained with the dataset exhibit
improvements in issue-resolving capabilities. Furthermore, by extending the
dataset size to over 12,000 high-quality trajectories, we established a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct based LLMs on the
OpenHands agent framework, which increases the resolve rate on
SWE-Bench-Verified by +21.8% for the 7B model and +46.0% for the 32B model and
validates the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有模型在处理未知的开放词汇构造(OVCs)时表现不佳，因为缺乏先验知识。专家可以在推理时提供正确的构造知识，但需要有效重用这些知识而不重新训练模型。

Method: 提出ROLex检索增强解析方法，包含检索器和生成器，使用动态增长的知识词典(NL短语到OVC构造的键值对)。通过合成数据生成和数据增强技术训练模型，并采用多种策略使模型关注相关检索知识。

Result: 在三个形式化任务(NL2LTL、NL2Code、NL2CMD)上的评估表明，DKAP是一个具有挑战性的问题，ROLex能有效利用动态专家知识提升基线模型性能。

Conclusion: DKAP框架和ROLex方法为解决开放词汇构造问题提供了有效方案，能够动态利用专家知识改进自然语言到形式语言的转换性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known
beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications
into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on
OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a
domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their
preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this
inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining
the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in
addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert
knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC
constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses
this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the
key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating
data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation
and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement)
pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we
propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of
retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled
after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization
tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a
difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models
by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.

Motivation: 研究诊断性预期在DSGE模型中的计量经济学特性，验证其与理性预期的区别及其对宏观经济波动的内生影响。

Method: 使用Qu和Tkachenko(2017)的识别框架进行分析，并将贝叶斯估计扩展到不确定性领域，采用序贯蒙特卡洛抽样方法以确保不同估计方法和均衡条件下的稳健结论。

Result: 诊断性预期产生了理性预期参数化无法匹配的波动性和持续性模式，保持了模型的整体识别性但削弱了冲击方差的识别，构成了独立于结构摩擦和外生冲击的宏观经济波动内生来源。

Conclusion: 诊断性预期在计量经济学上区别于理性预期，具有重要的宏观经济相关性，这些发现推进了预期理论的计量经济学研究。

Abstract: This paper provides the first econometric evidence for diagnostic
expectations (DE) in DSGE models. Using the identification framework of Qu and
Tkachenko (2017), I show that DE generate dynamics unattainable under rational
expectations (RE), with no RE parameterization capable of matching the
volatility and persistence patterns implied by DE. Consequently, DE are not
observationally equivalent to RE and constitute an endogenous source of
macroeconomic fluctuations, distinct from both structural frictions and
exogenous shocks. From an econometric perspective, DE preserve overall model
identification but weaken the identification of shock variances. To ensure
robust conclusions across estimation methods and equilibrium conditions, I
extend Bayesian estimation with Sequential Monte Carlo sampling to the
indeterminacy domain. These findings advance the econometric study of
expectations and highlight the macroeconomic relevance of diagnostic beliefs.

Conclusion: 该算法为统计决策问题提供了一种有效的计算工具，特别适用于需要随机选择决策规则的情况，在实证应用中表现出良好的实用性

Abstract: A decision rule is epsilon-minimax if it is minimax up to an additive factor
epsilon. We present an algorithm for provably obtaining epsilon-minimax
solutions of statistical decision problems. We are interested in problems where
the statistician chooses randomly among I decision rules. The minimax solution
of these problems admits a convex programming representation over the
(I-1)-simplex. Our suggested algorithm is a well-known mirror subgradient
descent routine, designed to approximately solve the convex optimization
problem that defines the minimax decision rule. This iterative routine is known
in the computer science literature as the hedge algorithm and it is used in
algorithmic game theory as a practical tool to find approximate solutions of
two-person zero-sum games. We apply the suggested algorithm to different
minimax problems in the econometrics literature. An empirical application to
the problem of optimally selecting sites to maximize the external validity of
an experimental policy evaluation illustrates the usefulness of the suggested
procedure.

Result: 通过Add Health数据库的实证应用表明，网络数据错误会对估计的同伴效应产生较大的向下偏差

Conclusion: 网络数据不完整会显著影响同伴效应估计，但通过获得网络分布的一致性估计可以解决这一问题

Abstract: We study the estimation of peer effects through social networks when
researchers do not observe the entire network structure. Special cases include
sampled networks, censored networks, and misclassified links. We assume that
researchers can obtain a consistent estimator of the distribution of the
network. We show that this assumption is sufficient for estimating peer effects
using a linear-in-means model. We provide an empirical application to the study
of peer effects on students' academic achievement using the widely used Add
Health database, and show that network data errors have a large downward bias
on estimated peer effects.

*Akshay Vij,Stephane Hess*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了使用潜在类别选择模型(LCCMs)的后验推断方法，作为混合选择模型的替代方案，用于研究态度与行为关系，具有更好的灵活性和透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混合选择模型在分析态度与行为关系时过于复杂且存在收敛问题，需要更简单透明的替代方法

Method: 使用潜在类别选择模型，通过后验推断恢复类别特定的态度特征，而不是将态度构念嵌入结构模型中

Result: 后验推断方法能够提供丰富的行为洞察，而因子模型可能丢失关键态度信息，混合模型在解释力上增益有限但计算负担显著增加

Conclusion: 当目标是解释偏好异质性时，后验推断是混合模型的实用替代方案，既保持了可解释性和鲁棒性，又不牺牲行为深度

Abstract: The link between attitudes and behaviour has been a key topic in choice
modelling for two decades, with the widespread application of ever more complex
hybrid choice models. This paper proposes a flexible and transparent
alternative framework for empirically examining the relationship between
attitudes and behaviours using latent class choice models (LCCMs). Rather than
embedding attitudinal constructs within the structural model, as in hybrid
choice frameworks, we recover class-specific attitudinal profiles through
posterior inference. This approach enables analysts to explore
attitude-behaviour associations without the complexity and convergence issues
often associated with integrated estimation. Two case studies are used to
demonstrate the framework: one on employee preferences for working from home,
and another on public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. Across both studies, we
compare posterior profiling of indicator means, fractional multinomial logit
(FMNL) models, factor-based representations, and hybrid specifications. We find
that posterior inference methods provide behaviourally rich insights with
minimal additional complexity, while factor-based models risk discarding key
attitudinal information, and fullinformation hybrid models offer little gain in
explanatory power and incur substantially greater estimation burden. Our
findings suggest that when the goal is to explain preference heterogeneity,
posterior inference offers a practical alternative to hybrid models, one that
retains interpretability and robustness without sacrificing behavioural depth.

TL;DR: 化学品行业减排路径分析：通过场景分析模型研究了基础化学品生产的减排投资需求和时间线，发现在最佳投资环境下需要超过万亿美元投资才能在2050年前实现深度减排。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学品行业占全球温室气体排放的5%，且是最难减排的行业之一。但之前的路径研究往往忽视了企业投资决策在资本密集型行业中的核心作用。

Method: 采用场景分析方法，在不确定的长期投资环境下模拟不同减排资本分配速度。对四个主要生产区域的2,600多个生产设施进行个别项目建模，构建最低成本减排时间线。

Result: 深度减排生产的时间线因化学品种和地区而异，但更重要地受投资环境影响。在最佳环境下，未来20-30年的年均减排投资需要超过历史正常投资，累计投资超过万亿美元。如果关键驱动因素刻制投资意愿，减排时间线将延长到末条中叶。

Conclusion: 化学品行业深度减排的成功实现依赖于投资环境的支持，需要大规模额外投资和长期的资本分配。政策制定者和企业需要关注投资环境的创造，以确保减排目标的可行性。

Abstract: The chemicals industry accounts for about 5% of global greenhouse gas
emissions today and is among the most difficult industries to abate. We model
decarbonization pathways for the most energy-intensive segment of the industry,
the production of basic chemicals: olefins, aromatics, methanol, ammonia, and
chlor-alkali. Unlike most prior pathways studies, we apply a scenario-analysis
approach that recognizes the central role of corporate investment decision
making for capital-intensive industries, under highly uncertain long-term
future investment environments. We vary the average pace of decarbonization
capital allocation allowed under plausible alternative future world contexts
and construct least-cost decarbonization timelines by modeling abatement
projects individually across more than 2,600 production facilities located in
four major producing regions. The timeline for deeply decarbonizing production
varies by chemical and region but depends importantly on the investment
environment context. In the best-of-all environments, to deeply decarbonize
production, annual average capital spending for abatement for the next two to
three decades will need to be greater than (and in addition to) historical
"business-as-usual" investments, and cumulative investment in abatement
projects would exceed $1 trillion. In futures where key drivers constrain
investment appetites, timelines for decarbonizing the industry extend well into
the second half of the century.

### [139] [Electoral Competition with Credible Promises and Strategic Voters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08249)
*Shiladitya Kumar*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 通过引入非天真或战略性投票行为，使得选民能够利用借誉机制促使政客提出更接近选民偏好且可信的政策批评，通过以失去借誉为惩罚的可信威胁提高期望效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过重复选举中的借誉和造连任关注来促使政客提出更接近选民偏好且可信承诺的政策平台，而不假设选民是天真的。

Method: 建立一个形式模型，通过引入非天真（战略性）投票行为来完整描述子游戏精炼均衡集，以借誉作为选后政策纪律的工具。

Result: 非天真投票行为能够成功促使候选人在均衡中提出最大励志兼容承诺，通过以失去借誉为惩罚的可信威胁，使得选民获得一致的预望效用提升。趋势分析显示赢得选举概率越高的候选人越可能遵守承诺。

Conclusion: 战略性投票行为能够减少空话，创造一个可信的选举制度，使得候选人在当选后遵守承诺，选民不仅能够奔到更可信的承诺，还能在均衡中提高预望未来收益。

Abstract: How can voters induce politicians to put forth more proximate (in terms of
preference) as well as credible platforms (in terms of promise fulfillment)
under repeated elections? Building on the work of Aragones et al. (2007), I
study how reputation and re-election concerns affect candidate behavior and its
resultant effect on voters' beliefs and their consequent electoral decisions. I
present a formal model where, instead of assuming voters to be naive, I tackle
the question by completely characterizing a set of subgame-perfect equilibria
by introducing non-naive (or strategic) voting behavior into the mix. I find
that non-naive voting behavior, by using the candidate's reputation as an
instrument of policy discipline after the election, aids in successfully
inducing candidates to put forth their maximal incentive-compatible promise
(among a range of such credible promises) in equilibrium. Through the credible
threat of punishment in the form of loss of reputation for all future
elections, non-naive voters gain a unanimous increase in expected utility
relative to when they behave naively. In fact, comparative statics show that
candidates who are more likely to win are more likely to keep their promises.
In this framework, voters are not only able to bargain for more credible
promises but also end up raising their expected future payoffs in equilibrium.
Including such forms of strategic behavior thus reduces cheap talk by creating
a credible electoral system where candidates do as they say once elected.
Later, I present an analysis that includes limited punishment as a political
accountability mechanism.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了生成式AI双胎技术对人类生产力的影响，通过主体-代理模型研究了AI双胎在提高输出质量和取代人类工作之间的担承，并提出了任务可编辑性和可验证性的分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI双胎技术如何在补充创造者能力的同时可能取代人类工作者，以及如何设计激励机制来平衡这种担承。

Method: 使用主体-代理模型分析，提出任务可编辑性和可验证性的框架，综合最新实证研究进行分析。

Result: 高可验证性但低可编辑性的任务最适合工作者培训AI双胎，但低风险任务受到替代风险的限制。成功的公司支持生成式AI需要细致的激励设计。

Conclusion: 公共政策应鼓励在生成式AI改进中平衡工作者收益，这样才能实现更持久的长期生产力增长。

Abstract: Generative AI is a technology which depends in part on participation by
humans in training and improving the automation potential. We focus on the
development of an "AI twin" that could complement its creator's efforts,
enabling them to produce higher-quality output in their individual style.
However, AI twins could also, over time, replace individual humans. We analyze
this trade-off using a principal-agent model in which agents have the
opportunity to make investments into training an AI twin that lead to a lower
cost of effort, a higher probability of success, or both. We propose a new
framework to situate the model in which the tasks performed vary in the ease to
which AI output can be improved by the human (the "editability") and also vary
in the extent to which a non-expert can assess the quality of output (its
"verifiability.") Our synthesis of recent empirical studies indicates that
productivity gains from the use of generative AI are higher overall when task
editability is higher, while non-experts enjoy greater relative productivity
gains for tasks with higher verifiability. We show that during investment a
strategic agent will trade off improvements in quality and ease of effort to
preserve their wage bargaining power. Tasks with high verifiability and low
editability are most aligned with a worker's incentives to train their twin,
but for tasks where the stakes are low, this alignment is constrained by the
risk of displacement. Our results suggest that sustained improvements in
company-sponsored generative AI will require nuanced design of human
incentives, and that public policy which encourages balancing worker returns
with generative AI improvements could yield more sustained long-run
productivity gains.

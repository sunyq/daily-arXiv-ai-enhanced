### [1] [Solving Pasur Using GPU-Accelerated Counterfactual Regret Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06559)
*Sina Baghal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个基于CUDA加速的计算框架，用于模拟Pasur游戏，并通过CFR算法计算近纳什均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pasur游戏的复杂规则和大规模游戏树带来了独特的计算挑战，需要高效的框架来解决。

Method: 使用PyTorch CUDA张量处理规则复杂性，通过分解游戏树和轮次反向训练策略降低内存和计算复杂度。

Result: 构建了包含超过10^9个节点的完整游戏树，并训练了基于树的模型预测策略。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到其他多轮次强化学习问题，如策略游戏或金融市场的顺序交易决策。

Abstract: Pasur is a fishing card game played over six rounds and is played similarly
to games such as Cassino and Scopa, and Bastra. This paper introduces a
CUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing
efficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash
equilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm
for solving large imperfect-information games.
  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the
large size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA
tensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose
the game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)
inherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by
pairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This
design reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and
node connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a
round-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and
recursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach
constructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$
nodes. We provide detailed implementation snippets.
  After computing a near-Nash equilibrium strategy, we train a tree-based model
to predict these strategies for use during gameplay. We then estimate the fair
value of each deck through large-scale self-play between equilibrium strategies
by simulating, for instance, 10,000 games per matchup, executed in parallel
using GPU acceleration.
  Similar frameworks can be extended to other reinforcement learning algorithms
where the action tree naturally decomposes into multiple rounds such as
turn-based strategy games or sequential trading decisions in financial markets.

### [2] [Operationalizing Serendipity: Multi-Agent AI Workflows for Enhanced Materials Characterization with Theory-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06569)
*Lance Yao,Suman Samantray,Ayana Ghosh,Kevin Roccapriore,Libor Kovarik,Sarah Allec,Maxim Ziatdinov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciLink是一个开源的多智能体AI框架，旨在通过自动化链接实验观察、新颖性评估和理论模拟，促进材料研究中的意外发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代自动化实验室虽然高效，但可能忽视意外发现。SciLink旨在填补这一空白，通过AI框架促进材料研究中的意外发现。

Method: 采用混合AI策略，结合机器学习模型和大型语言模型，将实验数据转化为可验证的科学主张，并评估其新颖性。

Result: SciLink在多种研究场景中表现出色，能够处理高分辨率数据、整合专家指导，并提出后续实验建议。

Conclusion: SciLink不仅提高了研究效率，还创造了一个有利于意外发现的环境，填补了自动化实验与开放式科学探索之间的空白。

Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where
unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of
inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis
testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial,
unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source,
multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize
serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between
experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The
framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning
models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language
models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw
data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific
claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published
literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research
scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral
data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its
ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments.
By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink
provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only
enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for
serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated
experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

### [3] [IRL-VLA: Training an Vision-Language-Action Policy via Reward World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06571)
*Anqing Jiang,Yu Gao,Yiru Wang,Zhigang Sun,Shuo Wang,Yuwen Heng,Hao Sun,Shichen Tang,Lijuan Zhu,Jinhao Chai,Jijun Wang,Zichong Gu,Hao Jiang,Li Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出IRL-VLA框架，通过三阶段方法解决自动驾驶中VLA模型的闭环训练问题，结合模仿学习和逆强化学习，最终在NAVSIM v2和CVPR2025竞赛中取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在自动驾驶中面临开环模仿学习的性能限制和闭环训练的高成本问题，需要一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 通过模仿学习预训练VLA策略；2) 构建轻量级奖励世界模型；3) 通过PPO优化奖励模型，平衡安全、舒适和效率。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2端到端驾驶基准和CVPR2025竞赛中取得领先成绩。

Conclusion: IRL-VLA框架为闭环自动驾驶中的VLA研究提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated potential in autonomous
driving. However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1)
Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in
open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset,
leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training
relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and
computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we
introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via
\textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model
with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage
paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the
VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a
lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable
efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning
performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence
reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively
balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in NAVSIM v2 end-to-end driving
benchmark, 1st runner up in CVPR2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge. We hope that
our framework will accelerate VLA research in close-loop autonomous driving.

### [4] [CountQA: How Well Do MLLMs Count in the Wild?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06585)
*Jayant Sravan Tamarapalli,Rynaa Grover,Nilay Pande,Sahiti Yerramilli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CountQA是一个新基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂场景中的物体计数能力，揭示其性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉场景理解中表现出色，但在物体计数方面存在明显缺陷，限制了其实际应用可靠性。

Method: 引入CountQA基准，包含1,500多个真实世界高密度、杂乱和遮挡的图像问答对，评估15种MLLMs。

Result: 表现最佳的模型准确率仅为42.9%，且随着物体数量增加性能下降。

Conclusion: CountQA为诊断和改进MLLMs的计数能力提供了工具，推动其向数值和空间感知方向发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in
understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental
cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their
reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been
largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature
sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to
test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce
CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency.
Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images
with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness
by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the
top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining
as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and
rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs
that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and
spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance
to foster further research.

### [5] [Formal Concept Analysis: a Structural Framework for Variability Extraction and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06668)
*Jessie Galasso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文总结了形式概念分析（FCA）在变异性分析中的关键属性及其应用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCA在变异性分析中潜力巨大，但由于其数学基础文献的复杂性，如何利用其属性进行变异性任务并不直观。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过筛选FCA框架中对变异性分析至关重要的属性，并探讨如何利用这些属性解释概念结构中的变异性信息。

Result: 明确了FCA中可用于变异性分析的关键属性及其应用方式。

Conclusion: 本文为FCA在变异性分析中的应用提供了实用指导，帮助研究者更高效地利用其数学框架。

Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for knowledge
representation and discovery. It performs a hierarchical clustering over a set
of objects described by attributes, resulting in conceptual structures in which
objects are organized depending on the attributes they share. These conceptual
structures naturally highlight commonalities and variabilities among similar
objects by categorizing them into groups which are then arranged by similarity,
making it particularly appropriate for variability extraction and analysis.
Despite the potential of FCA, determining which of its properties can be
leveraged for variability-related tasks (and how) is not always
straightforward, partly due to the mathematical orientation of its foundational
literature. This paper attempts to bridge part of this gap by gathering a
selection of properties of the framework which are essential to variability
analysis, and how they can be used to interpret diverse variability information
within the resulting conceptual structures.

### [6] [Zero-Shot Cellular Trajectory Map Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06674)
*Weijie Shi,Yue Cui,Hao Chen,Jiaming Li,Mengze Li,Jia Zhu,Jiajie Xu,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于像素的轨迹校准方法，用于零样本CTMM，通过地理空间知识校准轨迹并优化路径查找。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTMM方法依赖区域特定数据，难以适应未探索区域，需提升零样本场景下的准确性和适应性。

Method: 结合高斯混合模型的VAE提取场景自适应特征，设计时空感知模块捕获序列特征和位置不确定性，使用约束路径查找算法重建道路ID序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本CTMM中性能优于现有方法16.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过知识共享和误差缓解策略，显著提升了零样本CTMM的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Cellular Trajectory Map-Matching (CTMM) aims to align cellular location
sequences to road networks, which is a necessary preprocessing in
location-based services on web platforms like Google Maps, including navigation
and route optimization. Current approaches mainly rely on ID-based features and
region-specific data to learn correlations between cell towers and roads,
limiting their adaptability to unexplored areas. To enable high-accuracy CTMM
without additional training in target regions, Zero-shot CTMM requires to
extract not only region-adaptive features, but also sequential and location
uncertainty to alleviate positioning errors in cellular data. In this paper, we
propose a pixel-based trajectory calibration assistant for zero-shot CTMM,
which takes advantage of transferable geospatial knowledge to calibrate
pixelated trajectory, and then guide the path-finding process at the road
network level. To enhance knowledge sharing across similar regions, a Gaussian
mixture model is incorporated into VAE, enabling the identification of
scenario-adaptive experts through soft clustering. To mitigate high positioning
errors, a spatial-temporal awareness module is designed to capture sequential
features and location uncertainty, thereby facilitating the inference of
approximate user positions. Finally, a constrained path-finding algorithm is
employed to reconstruct the road ID sequence, ensuring topological validity
within the road network. This process is guided by the calibrated trajectory
while optimizing for the shortest feasible path, thus minimizing unnecessary
detours. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing
methods in zero-shot CTMM by 16.8\%.

### [7] [Probabilistic Circuits for Knowledge Graph Completion with Reduced Rule Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06706)
*Jaikrishna Manojkumar Patil,Nathaniel Lee,Al Mehdi Saadat Chowdhury,YooJung Choi,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于规则上下文和概率电路的方法，显著减少了知识图谱补全所需的规则数量，同时保持或超越基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于规则的知识图谱补全方法中规则数量过多导致解释性降低的问题。

Method: 从训练数据中发现规则上下文，并利用概率分布（概率电路）快速达到完整规则集的性能。

Result: 规则数量减少70-96%，性能最高提升31倍，保留基线峰值性能的91%。

Conclusion: 该方法在8个标准数据集上验证有效，且具有更广泛的概率推理应用潜力。

Abstract: Rule-based methods for knowledge graph completion provide explainable results
but often require a significantly large number of rules to achieve competitive
performance. This can hinder explainability due to overwhelmingly large rule
sets. We discover rule contexts (meaningful subsets of rules that work
together) from training data and use learned probability distribution (i.e.
probabilistic circuits) over these rule contexts to more rapidly achieve
performance of the full rule set. Our approach achieves a 70-96% reduction in
number of rules used while outperforming baseline by up to 31$\times$ when
using equivalent minimal number of rules and preserves 91% of peak baseline
performance even when comparing our minimal rule sets against baseline's full
rule sets. We show that our framework is grounded in well-known semantics of
probabilistic logic, does not require independence assumptions, and that our
tractable inference procedure provides both approximate lower bounds and exact
probability of a given query. The efficacy of our method is validated by
empirical studies on 8 standard benchmark datasets where we show competitive
performance by using only a fraction of the rules required by AnyBURL's
standard inference method, the current state-of-the-art for rule-based
knowledge graph completion. This work may have further implications for general
probabilistic reasoning over learned sets of rules.

### [8] [GLIDR: Graph-Like Inductive Logic Programming with Differentiable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06716)
*Blair Johnson,Clayton Kerce,Faramarz Fekri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GLIDR是一种可微分的规则学习方法，通过更灵活的语法和消息传递推理算法，提升了知识图谱任务中的规则学习和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可微分归纳逻辑编程（ILP）方法受限于链式规则结构，影响了性能和可解释性。

Method: GLIDR采用可微分消息传递推理算法，支持分支和循环等复杂规则结构，并允许从模型权重中提取显式逻辑规则。

Result: GLIDR在知识图谱补全任务中显著优于现有规则学习方法，甚至可与嵌入方法竞争，且对训练数据噪声具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLIDR不仅提升了规则学习的表达能力，还能与深度神经网络结合进行端到端优化，适用于多模态数据。

Abstract: Differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques have proven
effective at finding approximate rule-based solutions to link prediction and
node classification problems on knowledge graphs; however, the common
assumption of chain-like rule structure can hamper the performance and
interpretability of existing approaches. We introduce GLIDR, a differentiable
rule learning method that models the inference of logic rules with more
expressive syntax than previous methods. GLIDR uses a differentiable message
passing inference algorithm that generalizes previous chain-like rule learning
methods to allow rules with features like branches and cycles. GLIDR has a
simple and expressive rule search space which is parameterized by a limit on
the maximum number of free variables that may be included in a rule. Explicit
logic rules can be extracted from the weights of a GLIDR model for use with
symbolic solvers. We demonstrate that GLIDR can significantly outperform
existing rule learning methods on knowledge graph completion tasks and even
compete with embedding methods despite the inherent disadvantage of being a
structure-only prediction method. We show that rules extracted from GLIDR
retain significant predictive performance, and that GLIDR is highly robust to
training data noise. Finally, we demonstrate that GLIDR can be chained with
deep neural networks and optimized end-to-end for rule learning on arbitrary
data modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ParBalans，一种并行化Balans的方法，通过结合求解器级和算法级并行性，显著提升混合整数规划问题的求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合整数规划问题因其组合性质需要大量计算资源，并行化是加速求解的关键策略。Balans的模块化架构支持并行探索，但尚未充分研究。

Method: 扩展Balans为ParBalans，利用求解器级和算法级并行性，优化性能。

Result: 实验表明，ParBalans在复杂基准测试中表现优于商业求解器Gurobi。

Conclusion: ParBalans通过并行化显著提升求解效率，尤其在困难问题上具有竞争力。

Abstract: Solving Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems often requires substantial
computational resources due to their combinatorial nature. Parallelization has
emerged as a critical strategy to accelerate solution times and enhance
scalability to tackle large, complex instances. This paper investigates the
parallelization capabilities of Balans, a recently proposed multi-armed
bandits-based adaptive large neighborhood search for MIPs. While Balans's
modular architecture inherently supports parallel exploration of diverse
parameter configurations, this potential has not been thoroughly examined. To
address this gap, we introduce ParBalans, an extension that leverages both
solver-level and algorithmic-level parallelism to improve performance on
challenging MIP instances. Our experimental results demonstrate that ParBalans
exhibits competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art commercial
solver Gurobi, particularly on hard optimization benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图扩散策略优化（GDPO）和Stackelberg博弈（SG）的自组织无人机网络框架，以解决动态移动性和暴露风险带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机网络在敏感应用中的需求增长，确保可靠连接和隐蔽通信变得至关重要。

Method: 使用GDPO方法生成稀疏但连接良好的拓扑结构，并结合SG激励机制引导无人机选择支持合作的转发行为和邻居链接。

Result: 实验验证了框架在模型收敛性、拓扑生成质量和隐蔽通信性能提升方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效应对无人机网络的动态性和隐蔽通信需求。

Abstract: With the growing demand for Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks in
sensitive applications, such as urban monitoring, emergency response, and
secure sensing, ensuring reliable connectivity and covert communication has
become increasingly vital. However, dynamic mobility and exposure risks pose
significant challenges. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a
self-organizing UAV network framework combining Graph Diffusion-based Policy
Optimization (GDPO) with a Stackelberg Game (SG)-based incentive mechanism. The
GDPO method uses generative AI to dynamically generate sparse but
well-connected topologies, enabling flexible adaptation to changing node
distributions and Ground User (GU) demands. Meanwhile, the Stackelberg Game
(SG)-based incentive mechanism guides self-interested UAVs to choose relay
behaviors and neighbor links that support cooperation and enhance covert
communication. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of model convergence, topology
generation quality, and enhancement of covert communication performance.

*Evangelos Georganas,Dhiraj Kalamkar,Alexander Heinecke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对1/1.58/2位超低比特LLM模型的优化微内核，集成到PyTorch-TPP框架中，显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超低比特量化模型在资源受限环境（如边缘设备和AI PC）中的高效部署，填补现有推理运行时在计算效率上的研究空白。

Method: 设计并实现针对现代CPU优化的1位和2位微内核，集成到PyTorch-TPP框架中，进行端到端推理测试。

Result: 2位模型推理性能比当前SOTA运行时bitnet.cpp快2.2倍，比16位模型推理快7倍。

Conclusion: 优化后的推理运行时为超低比特LLM模型在AI PC和边缘设备上的高效部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the
perplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using
the same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these
quantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of
latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational
efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)
used to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up
approach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized
for modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of
CPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM
inference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference
results with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp
by up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model
inference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs
and edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM
models.

Method: 结合自然语言边界提示和控制模式，采用模糊支架逻辑和适应规则，无需微调或外部协调。

Result: 在模拟智能辅导场景中，框架显著提升了支架质量、适应性和教学对齐，优于标准提示基线。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于教育领域，还可扩展至其他交互密集型任务，为不确定或动态环境中的LLM行为提供了可重用方法。

Abstract: We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more
adaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered
tasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with
a control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.
This architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state
without requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated
intelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,
adaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming
standard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM
graders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has
shown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content
generation for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable
methodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in
uncertain or evolving contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体数据探索对科学数据解释至关重要，但缺乏领域知识或3D导航经验的用户难以选择最佳视点。

Result: 方法自动化视点选择，提升导航效率，并增强复杂科学现象的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言交互和语义引导，框架有效解决了体数据探索中的视点选择问题。

Abstract: Exploring volumetric data is crucial for interpreting scientific datasets.
However, selecting optimal viewpoints for effective navigation can be
challenging, particularly for users without extensive domain expertise or
familiarity with 3D navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
that leverages natural language interaction to enhance volumetric data
exploration. Our approach encodes volumetric blocks to capture and
differentiate underlying structures. It further incorporates a CLIP Score
mechanism, which provides semantic information to the blocks to guide
navigation. The navigation is empowered by a reinforcement learning framework
that leverage these semantic cues to efficiently search for and identify
desired viewpoints that align with the user's intent. The selected viewpoints
are evaluated using CLIP Score to ensure that they best reflect the user
queries. By automating viewpoint selection, our method improves the efficiency
of volumetric data navigation and enhances the interpretability of complex
scientific phenomena.

Result: 总结了核心挑战（如多模态表示、知识关联和推理决策），并探讨语言中心解决方案。

Conclusion: 为下一代遥感解释系统提供概念基础，规划认知驱动的地理空间分析路线图。

Abstract: The mainstream paradigm of remote sensing image interpretation has long been
dominated by vision-centered models, which rely on visual features for semantic
understanding. However, these models face inherent limitations in handling
multi-modal reasoning, semantic abstraction, and interactive decision-making.
While recent advances have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) into remote
sensing workflows, existing studies primarily focus on downstream applications,
lacking a unified theoretical framework that explains the cognitive role of
language. This review advocates a paradigm shift from vision-centered to
language-centered remote sensing interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the
Global Workspace Theory (GWT) of human cognition, We propose a
language-centered framework for remote sensing interpretation that treats LLMs
as the cognitive central hub integrating perceptual, task, knowledge and action
spaces to enable unified understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. We
first explore the potential of LLMs as the central cognitive component in
remote sensing interpretation, and then summarize core technical challenges,
including unified multimodal representation, knowledge association, and
reasoning and decision-making. Furthermore, we construct a global
workspace-driven interpretation mechanism and review how language-centered
solutions address each challenge. Finally, we outline future research
directions from four perspectives: adaptive alignment of multimodal data, task
understanding under dynamic knowledge constraints, trustworthy reasoning, and
autonomous interaction. This work aims to provide a conceptual foundation for
the next generation of remote sensing interpretation systems and establish a
roadmap toward cognition-driven intelligent geospatial analysis.

high cost and rigidity of full-model circuitization by enabling targeted
verification of strategically chosen subcomputations. These verifiable
segments, or "slices", may cover part or all of the inference pipeline, with
global consistency enforced through audit, replication, or economic incentives.
This architecture supports a pragmatic form of trust minimization, localizing
zero-knowledge proofs to the components where they provide the greatest value.
We evaluate DSperse using multiple proving systems and report empirical results
on memory usage, runtime, and circuit behavior under sliced and unsliced
configurations. By allowing proof boundaries to align flexibly with the model's
logical structure, DSperse supports scalable, targeted verification strategies
suited to diverse deployment needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习中，信用分配是一个关键挑战，尤其是在任务多样化和智能体协作层次复杂的情况下。

Method: 引入多级优势公式，通过显式反事实推理评估不同协作层次的信用，并利用注意力框架识别智能体间的相关性。

Result: 在Starcraft任务上的实验表明，MACA在复杂信用分配场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: MACA通过多级优势函数有效解决了多智能体协作中的信用分配问题。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit
assignment, which involves assessing each agent's contribution to the shared
reward. Given the diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of
coordination, with rewards attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent
subsets. In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number
of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple
coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that
performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct
levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures
agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that
reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an
attention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and
constructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive
experiments on challenging Starcraft v1\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior
performance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.

Result: 相比传统方法，隐私和传输质量分别提升77.8%和14.3%。

Conclusion: 所提算法有效提升隐蔽通信的隐私性和语义传输质量。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel covert semantic communication framework is
investigated. Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the
semantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several
time slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission
to acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being
eavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming
signals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic
information. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for
semantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not
communicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit
power of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic
information transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power
to maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of
the user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted
twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine
the transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot
without the communications between the server and the jammer. Compared to
standard reinforcement learning methods, the propose method uses an additional
Q network to estimate Q values such that the agent can select the action with a
lower Q value from the two Q networks thus avoiding local optimal action
selection and estimation bias of Q values. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm can improve the privacy and the semantic information
transmission quality by up to 77.8% and 14.3% compared to the traditional
reinforcement learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估MLLMs的基准存在规模小、覆盖窄和知识无结构化的问题，无法全面衡量模型的智能水平。

Method: 通过构建MDK12-Bench基准，结合动态评估框架和知识参考增强生成（KP-RAG）方法，全面测试MLLMs。

Result: 研究发现当前MLLMs在多个方面存在局限性，为提升模型鲁棒性和可解释性提供了指导。

Conclusion: MDK12-Bench为MLLMs的评估提供了更全面的工具，并为AI辅助教育的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which integrate language and visual
cues for problem-solving, are crucial for advancing artificial general
intelligence (AGI). However, current benchmarks for measuring the intelligence
of MLLMs suffer from limited scale, narrow coverage, and unstructured
knowledge, offering only static and undifferentiated evaluations. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MDK12-Bench, a large-scale multidisciplinary benchmark
built from real-world K-12 exams spanning six disciplines with 141K instances
and 6,225 knowledge points organized in a six-layer taxonomy. Covering five
question formats with difficulty and year annotations, it enables comprehensive
evaluation to capture the extent to which MLLMs perform over four dimensions:
1) difficulty levels, 2) temporal (cross-year) shifts, 3) contextual shifts,
and 4) knowledge-driven reasoning. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation
framework that introduces unfamiliar visual, textual, and question form shifts
to challenge model generalization while improving benchmark objectivity and
longevity by mitigating data contamination. We further evaluate knowledge-point
reference-augmented generation (KP-RAG) to examine the role of knowledge in
problem-solving. Key findings reveal limitations in current MLLMs in multiple
aspects and provide guidance for enhancing model robustness, interpretability,
and AI-assisted education.

Method: 采用基于ReAct原则的通用Python编码代理，通过精心设计的项目提示注入领域知识，结合文件操作和代码执行工具动态测试和验证。

Result: 该方法成功解决了CP-Bench基准集中的所有101个问题。

Conclusion: 约束建模任务需要通用编码工具和提示编码的领域知识，而非专用代理架构或预定义流程。

Abstract: Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint
models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring
deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous
approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with
predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark
problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any
fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the
ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for
stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding
constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific
expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The
agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and
code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and
verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code,
this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench
constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint
modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain
expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or
predefined workflows.

Motivation: 当前严重天气预警系统依赖人工专家解释，存在主观性和操作负担。AI技术的发展为自动化预测提供了新机遇。

Method: 构建了大规模多模态数据集MP-Bench，并开发了MMLM模型，通过自适应融合模块处理4D气象数据。

Result: MMLM在MP-Bench上表现优异，验证了其在严重天气预测中的有效性。

Conclusion: MMLM为自动化AI天气预测系统迈出了关键一步，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Timely and accurate severe weather warnings are critical for disaster
mitigation. However, current forecasting systems remain heavily reliant on
manual expert interpretation, introducing subjectivity and significant
operational burdens. With the rapid development of AI technologies, the
end-to-end "AI weather station" is gradually emerging as a new trend in
predicting severe weather events. Three core challenges impede the development
of end-to-end AI severe weather system: (1) scarcity of severe weather event
samples; (2) imperfect alignment between high-dimensional meteorological data
and textual warnings; (3) existing multimodal language models are unable to
handle high-dimensional meteorological data and struggle to fully capture the
complex dependencies across temporal sequences, vertical pressure levels, and
spatial dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce MP-Bench, the
first large-scale temporal multimodal dataset for severe weather events
prediction, comprising 421,363 pairs of raw multi-year meteorological data and
corresponding text caption, covering a wide range of severe weather scenarios
across China. On top of this dataset, we develop a meteorology multimodal large
model (MMLM) that directly ingests 4D meteorological inputs. In addition, it is
designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of 4D meteorological data
flow, incorporating three plug-and-play adaptive fusion modules that enable
dynamic feature extraction and integration across temporal sequences, vertical
pressure layers, and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on MP-Bench
demonstrate that MMLM performs exceptionally well across multiple tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in severe weather understanding and marking a
key step toward realizing automated, AI-driven weather forecasting systems. Our
source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励机（RMs）在强化学习中提高了样本效率，但其表达能力有限，无法处理更复杂的行为模式。本文旨在通过扩展RMs的表达能力，使其能够处理更广泛的时序行为。

Method: 提出了下推奖励机（pdRMs），基于确定性下推自动机，并设计了两种策略：一种可以访问整个堆栈，另一种只能访问堆栈顶部的k个符号。还提出了检查两种策略是否达到相同最优预期奖励的方法。

Result: 理论结果证明了pdRMs的表达能力，并提供了关于学习问题的空间复杂度分析。实验结果表明，pdRMs可以训练代理执行确定性上下文无关语言表示的任务。

Conclusion: pdRMs扩展了RMs的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的时序行为，为强化学习提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are automata structures that encode (non-Markovian)
reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL). RMs can reward any behaviour
representable in regular languages and, when paired with RL algorithms that
exploit RM structure, have been shown to significantly improve sample
efficiency in many domains. In this work, we present pushdown reward machines
(pdRMs), an extension of reward machines based on deterministic pushdown
automata. pdRMs can recognize and reward temporally extended behaviours
representable in deterministic context-free languages, making them more
expressive than reward machines. We introduce two variants of pdRM-based
policies, one which has access to the entire stack of the pdRM, and one which
can only access the top $k$ symbols (for a given constant $k$) of the stack. We
propose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given
environment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.
We then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,
and space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we
provide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks
representable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDBA在解决DCOPs时容易陷入局部最优，且性能提升有限，因此需要一种更有效的方法来克服这些问题。

Method: 提出了DGLS框架，包括自适应违反条件、惩罚蒸发机制和同步方案，以优化约束惩罚和协调更新。

Result: DGLS在标准基准测试中表现优异，尤其在结构化问题上显著优于现有方法（提升3.77%--66.3%）。

Conclusion: DGLS通过改进约束惩罚和协调机制，显著提升了DCOPs的求解性能，具有理论和实践的双重优势。

Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to
poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape
premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued
problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three
factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,
over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty
accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we
propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs
that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize
constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the
magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty
updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents
play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various
standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over
state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high
damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance
on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins
(\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.

TL;DR: CRAMF是一个概念驱动的检索增强数学形式化框架，通过检索核心数学概念的形式定义，提升基于LLM的自动形式化能力，解决了模型幻觉和语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式定理证明器（ITPs）需要手动形式化，耗时且依赖专家知识。自动形式化面临模型幻觉和语义鸿沟两大挑战。

Method: CRAMF通过从Mathlib4构建概念定义知识库，结合上下文查询增强和双通道混合检索策略，提升检索精度。

Result: 在miniF2F、ProofNet和AdvancedMath基准测试中，CRAMF显著提升了翻译准确率，最高达62.1%，平均提升29.9%。

Conclusion: CRAMF为自动形式化提供了一种有效解决方案，显著提升了LLM在数学形式化任务中的表现。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) require manual formalization, which is
labor-intensive and demands expert knowledge. While automated formalization
offers a potential solution, it faces two major challenges: model hallucination
(e.g., undefined predicates, symbol misuse, and version incompatibility) and
the semantic gap caused by ambiguous or missing premises in natural language
descriptions. To address these issues, we propose CRAMF, a Concept-driven
Retrieval-Augmented Mathematical Formalization framework. CRAMF enhances
LLM-based autoformalization by retrieving formal definitions of core
mathematical concepts, providing contextual grounding during code generation.
However, applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in this setting is
non-trivial due to the lack of structured knowledge bases, the polymorphic
nature of mathematical concepts, and the high precision required in formal
retrieval. We introduce a framework for automatically constructing a
concept-definition knowledge base from Mathlib4, the standard mathematical
library for the Lean 4 theorem prover, indexing over 26,000 formal definitions
and 1,000+ core mathematical concepts. To address conceptual polymorphism, we
propose contextual query augmentation with domain- and application-level
signals. In addition, we design a dual-channel hybrid retrieval strategy with
reranking to ensure accurate and relevant definition retrieval. Experiments on
miniF2F, ProofNet, and our newly proposed AdvancedMath benchmark show that
CRAMF can be seamlessly integrated into LLM-based autoformalizers, yielding
consistent improvements in translation accuracy, achieving up to 62.1% and an
average of 29.9% relative improvement.

Motivation: 多模态学习在农业中应用广泛，但模型可解释性常被忽视。本研究旨在利用Transformer的固有可解释性，解释多模态学习网络，特别是农作物产量预测任务。

Method: 使用四种输入模态（多光谱卫星、天气时间序列、地形高程图和土壤属性），基于自注意力机制提出AR和GA两种特征归因方法，以及WMA模态归因方法，并与SVS进行比较。

Result: Transformer模型在子田和田间水平的R2分数分别高出0.10和0.04；AR在时间归因上更稳健；模态归因方法显示不同模式。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在多模态学习中表现优异，AR方法提供更可靠的时间归因，模态归因方法有助于理解不同数据模态的贡献。

Abstract: Multimodal learning enables various machine learning tasks to benefit from
diverse data sources, effectively mimicking the interplay of different factors
in real-world applications, particularly in agriculture. While the
heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of
complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this
study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to
explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield
prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops,
regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral
satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties.
Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using
two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and
evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations,
Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality
Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS
attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform
other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks,
achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field
levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal
attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation,
compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was
leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established
agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying
patterns across the two methods compared.[...]

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能替代人类参与者进行心理学研究，并警示其局限性。

Method: 通过概念论证和实证研究（如调整措辞对比LLMs与人类反应差异）验证LLMs的不可靠性。

Result: LLMs在心理学研究中表现不一致，无法可靠模拟人类心理反应。

Conclusion: LLMs不适合模拟人类心理学，研究者应将其视为需验证的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs),such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used in
research, ranging from simple writing assistance to complex data annotation
tasks. Recently, some research has suggested that LLMs may even be able to
simulate human psychology and can, hence, replace human participants in
psychological studies. We caution against this approach. We provide conceptual
arguments against the hypothesis that LLMs simulate human psychology. We then
present empiric evidence illustrating our arguments by demonstrating that
slight changes to wording that correspond to large changes in meaning lead to
notable discrepancies between LLMs' and human responses, even for the recent
CENTAUR model that was specifically fine-tuned on psychological responses.
Additionally, different LLMs show very different responses to novel items,
further illustrating their lack of reliability. We conclude that LLMs do not
simulate human psychology and recommend that psychological researchers should
treat LLMs as useful but fundamentally unreliable tools that need to be
validated against human responses for every new application.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has fundamentally shifted the
bottleneck in AI development from computational power to data availability-with
countless valuable datasets remaining hidden across specialized repositories,
research appendices, and domain platforms. As reasoning capabilities and deep
research methodologies continue to evolve, a critical question emerges: can AI
agents transcend conventional search to systematically discover any dataset
that meets specific user requirements, enabling truly autonomous demand-driven
data curation? We introduce DatasetResearch, the first comprehensive benchmark
evaluating AI agents' ability to discover and synthesize datasets from 208
real-world demands across knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive tasks.
Our tri-dimensional evaluation framework reveals a stark reality: even advanced
deep research systems achieve only 22% score on our challenging
DatasetResearch-pro subset, exposing the vast gap between current capabilities
and perfect dataset discovery. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental
dichotomy-search agents excel at knowledge tasks through retrieval breadth,
while synthesis agents dominate reasoning challenges via structured
generation-yet both catastrophically fail on "corner cases" outside existing
distributions. These findings establish the first rigorous baseline for dataset
discovery agents and illuminate the path toward AI systems capable of finding
any dataset in the digital universe. Our benchmark and comprehensive analysis

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face persistent and evolving trustworthiness
issues, motivating developers to seek automated and flexible repair methods
that enable convenient deployment across diverse scenarios. Existing repair
methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) are costly and slow, while prompt engineering lacks robustness
and scalability. Representation engineering, which steers model behavior by
injecting targeted concept vectors during inference, offers a lightweight,
training-free alternative. However, current approaches depend on manually
crafted samples and fixed steering strategies, limiting automation and
adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose MASteer, the first
end-to-end framework for trustworthiness repair in LLMs based on representation
engineering. MASteer integrates two core components: AutoTester, a multi-agent
system that generates diverse, high-quality steer samples tailored to developer
needs; and AutoRepairer, which constructs adaptive steering strategies with
anchor vectors for automated, context-aware strategy selection during
inference. Experiments on standard and customized trustworthiness tasks show
MASteer consistently outperforms baselines, improving metrics by 15.36% on
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Chat and 4.21% on Qwen-3-8B-Chat, while maintaining general model
capabilities. MASteer demonstrates strong robustness, generalization, and
practical value for scalable, efficient trustworthiness repair.

Abstract: With recent and rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI),
understanding the foundation of purposeful behaviour in autonomous agents is
crucial for developing safe and efficient systems. While artificial neural
networks have dominated the path to AI, recent studies are exploring the
potential of biologically based systems, such as networks of living biological
neuronal networks. Along with promises of high power and data efficiency, these
systems may also inform more explainable and biologically plausible models. In
this work, we propose a framework rooted in active inference, a general theory
of behaviour, to model decision-making in embodied agents. Using
experiment-informed generative models, we simulate decision-making processes in
a simulated game-play environment, mirroring experimental setups that use
biological neurons. Our results demonstrate learning in these agents, providing
insights into the role of memory-based learning and predictive planning in
intelligent decision-making. This work contributes to the growing field of
explainable AI by offering a biologically grounded and scalable approach to
understanding purposeful behaviour in agents.

Conclusion: 伪布尔推理可作为IHS计算的有效替代方案，尤其在需要正确性证明的场景中，但商业整数规划求解器在效率上仍占优。

Abstract: The implicit hitting set (IHS) approach offers a general framework for
solving computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems declaratively.
IHS iterates between a decision oracle used for extracting sources of
inconsistency and an optimizer for computing so-called hitting sets (HSs) over
the accumulated sources of inconsistency. While the decision oracle is
language-specific, the optimizers is usually instantiated through integer
programming.
  We explore alternative algorithmic techniques for hitting set optimization
based on different ways of employing pseudo-Boolean (PB) reasoning as well as
stochastic local search. We extensively evaluate the practical feasibility of
the alternatives in particular in the context of pseudo-Boolean (0-1 IP)
optimization as one of the most recent instantiations of IHS. Highlighting a
trade-off between efficiency and reliability, while a commercial IP solver
turns out to remain the most effective way to instantiate HS computations, it
can cause correctness issues due to numerical instability; in fact, we show
that exact HS computations instantiated via PB reasoning can be made
competitive with a numerically exact IP solver. Furthermore, the use of PB
reasoning as a basis for HS computations allows for obtaining certificates for
the correctness of IHS computations, generally applicable to any IHS
instantiation in which reasoning in the declarative language at hand can be
captured in the PB-based proof format we employ.

TL;DR: MultiMedEdit是首个针对临床多模态任务的知识编辑（KE）基准，揭示了当前方法在复杂临床工作流中的局限性，并提供了未来开发临床鲁棒KE技术的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑研究主要关注通用领域和医学QA任务，忽视了多模态医学场景的需求，而医学KE需要结合视觉推理以支持安全可解释的临床决策。

Method: 提出MultiMedEdit框架，涵盖理解和推理任务类型，定义三维度量标准（可靠性、通用性和局部性），并支持跨范式比较。

Result: 实验表明当前方法在泛化和长尾推理方面表现不佳，特别是在复杂临床工作流中。效率分析揭示了实际部署中的权衡。

Conclusion: MultiMedEdit不仅揭示了当前方法的局限性，还为未来开发临床鲁棒的KE技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) provides a scalable approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models without full retraining. While previous
studies have demonstrated effectiveness in general domains and medical QA
tasks, little attention has been paid to KE in multimodal medical scenarios.
Unlike text-only settings, medical KE demands integrating updated knowledge
with visual reasoning to support safe and interpretable clinical decisions. To
address this gap, we propose MultiMedEdit, the first benchmark tailored to
evaluating KE in clinical multimodal tasks. Our framework spans both
understanding and reasoning task types, defines a three-dimensional metric
suite (reliability, generality, and locality), and supports cross-paradigm
comparisons across general and domain-specific models. We conduct extensive
experiments under single-editing and lifelong-editing settings. Results suggest
that current methods struggle with generalization and long-tail reasoning,
particularly in complex clinical workflows. We further present an efficiency
analysis (e.g., edit latency, memory footprint), revealing practical trade-offs
in real-world deployment across KE paradigms. Overall, MultiMedEdit not only
reveals the limitations of current approaches but also provides a solid
foundation for developing clinically robust knowledge editing techniques in the
future.

TL;DR: K-Dense Analyst是一个分层多代理系统，通过双循环架构实现自主生物信息学分析，性能优于现有大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生物信息学分析的复杂性导致数据生成与科学洞察之间存在巨大差距，现有大型语言模型在迭代计算、工具整合和严格验证方面存在局限。

Method: K-Dense Analyst采用分层多代理系统和双循环架构，将复杂目标分解为可执行、可验证的任务，并在安全计算环境中执行。

Result: 在BixBench基准测试中，K-Dense Analyst的准确率达到29.2%，比最佳语言模型（GPT-5）高出6.3个百分点，性能提升近27%。

Conclusion: 自主科学推理需要专门构建的系统，而不仅仅是增强的语言模型，K-Dense Analyst为生命科学领域的完全自主计算生物学家提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The complexity of modern bioinformatics analysis has created a critical gap
between data generation and developing scientific insights. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in scientific reasoning, they remain
fundamentally limited when dealing with real-world analytical workflows that
demand iterative computation, tool integration and rigorous validation. We
introduce K-Dense Analyst, a hierarchical multi-agent system that achieves
autonomous bioinformatics analysis through a dual-loop architecture. K-Dense
Analyst, part of the broader K-Dense platform, couples planning with validated
execution using specialized agents to decompose complex objectives into
executable, verifiable tasks within secure computational environments. On
BixBench, a comprehensive benchmark for open-ended biological analysis, K-Dense
Analyst achieves 29.2% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing language model
(GPT-5) by 6.3 percentage points, representing nearly 27% improvement over what
is widely considered the most powerful LLM available. Remarkably, K-Dense
Analyst achieves this performance using Gemini 2.5 Pro, which attains only
18.3% accuracy when used directly, demonstrating that our architectural
innovations unlock capabilities far beyond the underlying model's baseline
performance. Our insights demonstrate that autonomous scientific reasoning
requires more than enhanced language models, it demands purpose-built systems
that can bridge the gap between high-level scientific objectives and low-level
computational execution. These results represent a significant advance toward
fully autonomous computational biologists capable of accelerating discovery
across the life sciences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在日常生活中的普及，对更安全、可靠的内容审核需求增加。LLMs虽强大，但在道德推理和偏见检测方面仍有不足。

Method: 开发了一个实验框架，基于SOTA模型评估人类情感和攻击性行为，并引入统一基准数据集。提出SafePhi模型，通过QLoRA微调Phi-4。

Result: SafePhi在Macro F1得分上达到0.89，优于OpenAI Moderator（0.77）和Llama Guard（0.74）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在内容审核中的关键不足，强调需要更多异构数据和人类参与以提高模型鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, the need for safer and
more reliable moderation has never been greater. Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing earlier models in
complexity and performance. Their evaluation across diverse tasks has
consistently showcased their potential, enabling the development of adaptive
and personalized agents. However, despite these advancements, LLMs remain prone
to errors, particularly in areas requiring nuanced moral reasoning. They
struggle with detecting implicit hate, offensive language, and gender biases
due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Moreover,
their reliance on training data can inadvertently reinforce societal biases,
leading to inconsistencies and ethical concerns in their outputs. To explore
the limitations of LLMs in this role, we developed an experimental framework
based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to assess human emotions and offensive
behaviors. The framework introduces a unified benchmark dataset encompassing 49
distinct categories spanning the wide spectrum of human emotions, offensive and
hateful text, and gender and racial biases. Furthermore, we introduced SafePhi,
a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Phi-4, adapting diverse ethical contexts and
outperforming benchmark moderators by achieving a Macro F1 score of 0.89, where
OpenAI Moderator and Llama Guard score 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. This
research also highlights the critical domains where LLM moderators consistently
underperformed, pressing the need to incorporate more heterogeneous and
representative data with human-in-the-loop, for better model robustness and
explainability.

Motivation: 现有教育领域的机器学习模型多为静态，无法适应新数据（如干预后结果），需要动态调整以提高预测准确性。

Method: 采用LightGBM回归器结合增量式再训练，集成Flask网络接口和SHAP解释工具，实现实时交互与透明性。

Result: 实验显示，再训练后RMSE降低10.7%，干预学生预测分数持续上调。

Conclusion: 该框架将静态预测器转化为自优化系统，推动教育分析向以人为本、数据驱动和响应式AI发展。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of student performance is essential for timely academic
intervention. However, most machine learning models in education are static and
cannot adapt when new data, such as post-intervention outcomes, become
available. To address this limitation, we propose a Feedback-Driven Decision
Support System (DSS) with a closed-loop architecture that enables continuous
model refinement. The system integrates a LightGBM-based regressor with
incremental retraining, allowing educators to input updated student results,
which automatically trigger model updates. This adaptive mechanism improves
prediction accuracy by learning from real-world academic progress. The platform
features a Flask-based web interface for real-time interaction and incorporates
SHAP for explainability, ensuring transparency. Experimental results show a
10.7\% reduction in RMSE after retraining, with consistent upward adjustments
in predicted scores for intervened students. By transforming static predictors
into self-improving systems, our approach advances educational analytics toward
human-centered, data-driven, and responsive AI. The framework is designed for
integration into LMS and institutional dashboards.

Motivation: 传统表格到文本模型在跨层次结构和上下文感知差异方面能力不足，无法满足商业报告需求。

Method: 采用多代理管道，包括数据切片、方差检测、上下文构建和基于LLM的生成。

Result: 框架在数据忠实度（83%）、显著变化覆盖和决策关键洞察相关性（4.4/5）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂商业场景中（如价格变化与销量下降的权衡）表现突出，显著提升总结质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for summarizing structured enterprise data
across multiple dimensions using large language model (LLM)-based agents.
Traditional table-to-text models often lack the capacity to reason across
hierarchical structures and context-aware deltas, which are essential in
business reporting tasks. Our method introduces a multi-agent pipeline that
extracts, analyzes, and summarizes multi-dimensional data using agents for
slicing, variance detection, context construction, and LLM-based generation.
Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms traditional
approaches, achieving 83\% faithfulness to underlying data, superior coverage
of significant changes, and high relevance scores (4.4/5) for decision-critical
insights. The improvements are especially pronounced in categories involving
subtle trade-offs, such as increased revenue due to price changes amid
declining unit volumes, which competing methods either overlook or address with
limited specificity. We evaluate the framework on Kaggle datasets and
demonstrate significant improvements in faithfulness, relevance, and insight
quality over baseline table summarization approaches.

Method: 提出EndoAgent，采用双记忆设计，结合短期行动追踪和长期经验学习，集成专家工具于统一推理循环中。

Result: 在EndoAgentBench基准测试中，EndoAgent表现优于通用和医学多模态模型，展示了其灵活性和推理能力。

Conclusion: EndoAgent为内窥镜图像诊断提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing general artificial intelligence (AI) systems to support endoscopic
image diagnosis is an emerging research priority. Existing methods based on
large-scale pretraining often lack unified coordination across tasks and
struggle to handle the multi-step processes required in complex clinical
workflows. While AI agents have shown promise in flexible instruction parsing
and tool integration across domains, their potential in endoscopy remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose EndoAgent, the first
memory-guided agent for vision-to-decision endoscopic analysis that integrates
iterative reasoning with adaptive tool selection and collaboration. Built on a
dual-memory design, it enables sophisticated decision-making by ensuring
logical coherence through short-term action tracking and progressively
enhancing reasoning acuity through long-term experiential learning. To support
diverse clinical tasks, EndoAgent integrates a suite of expert-designed tools
within a unified reasoning loop. We further introduce EndoAgentBench, a
benchmark of 5,709 visual question-answer pairs that assess visual
understanding and language generation capabilities in realistic scenarios.
Extensive experiments show that EndoAgent consistently outperforms both general
and medical multimodal models, exhibiting its strong flexibility and reasoning
capabilities.

Result: 通过案例研究创建了XUBench，验证了Comp-Comp框架的有效性。

Conclusion: Comp-Comp框架不仅适用于学术领域，还可扩展到其他领域，为基准构建提供新思路。

Abstract: Numerous benchmarks have been built to evaluate the domain-specific abilities
of large language models (LLMs), highlighting the need for effective and
efficient benchmark construction. Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily
focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning
or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact
of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of
domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and
demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for
benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an
iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness
principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while
compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To
validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned
university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and
comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as
the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible
beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across
various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在渗透测试中存在错误处理差、推理效率低和无法自主完成复杂任务的问题，Pentest-R1旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习：离线RL学习基础攻击逻辑，在线RL在CTF环境中通过环境反馈进行微调。

Result: 在AutoPenBench上成功率为24.2%，Cybench上为15.0%，性能接近顶级专有模型。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练协同是关键，Pentest-R1为开源LLM设定了新标杆。

Abstract: Automating penetration testing is crucial for enhancing cybersecurity, yet
current Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant limitations in this
domain, including poor error handling, inefficient reasoning, and an inability
to perform complex end-to-end tasks autonomously. To address these challenges,
we introduce Pentest-R1, a novel framework designed to optimize LLM reasoning
capabilities for this task through a two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline.
We first construct a dataset of over 500 real-world, multi-step walkthroughs,
which Pentest-R1 leverages for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to instill
foundational attack logic. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via online RL in
an interactive Capture The Flag (CTF) environment, where it learns directly
from environmental feedback to develop robust error self-correction and
adaptive strategies. Our extensive experiments on the Cybench and AutoPenBench
benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. On AutoPenBench,
Pentest-R1 achieves a 24.2\% success rate, surpassing most state-of-the-art
models and ranking second only to Gemini 2.5 Flash. On Cybench, it attains a
15.0\% success rate in unguided tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
open-source LLMs and matching the performance of top proprietary models.
Ablation studies confirm that the synergy of both training stages is critical
to its success.

TL;DR: Invert4TVG框架通过三个反转任务增强视频片段定位和语义理解，显著提升了定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TVG方法过度依赖IoU指标，忽略了语义动作理解，影响了鲁棒性。

Method: 引入三个反转任务（动词补全、动作识别、视频描述），结合强化学习框架优化定位和语义。

Result: 在Charades-STA上，R1@0.7指标提升7.1%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过反转任务增强语义理解，显著提高了定位准确性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) seeks to localize video segments matching a
given textual query. Current methods, while optimizing for high temporal
Intersection-over-Union (IoU), often overfit to this metric, compromising
semantic action understanding in the video and query, a critical factor for
robust TVG. To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),
a novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action
understanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion
tasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting
masked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,
identifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating
descriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.
These tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with
well-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization
and semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving a 7.1\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B
model compared to Time-R1. By inverting TVG to derive query-related actions
from segments, our approach strengthens semantic understanding, significantly
raising the ceiling of localization accuracy.

Result: BERTopic和NMF能生成与100%的愿景元素相似的主题，其中BERTopic表现更优，超过一半的相关主题达到“中等”或“强”相关性。

Abstract: Given recent breakthroughs in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and
Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more professional services are being
augmented through Artificial Intelligence (AI), which once seemed impossible to
automate. This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing
strategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading
machine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified
modules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to
generate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To
accomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of
reports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics
from each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a
published strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that
these techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the
elements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs
best in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving
a "medium" or "strong" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan
development impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal
government in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the
public good. Further work will focus on the operationalization of the concept
proven in this study as well as viability of the remaining modules in the
proposed model for GAI-generated strategic plans.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI
agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing
agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after
deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving
environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution
techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction
data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation
for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation
models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for
self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified
conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of
self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:
System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a
foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this
framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques
that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate
domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as
biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are
tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated
discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for
self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their
effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and
practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,
laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and
lifelong agentic systems.

engineering techniques, the development of effective memory architectures,
multi-modal information processing, and alignment strategies through
fine-tuning algorithms. We evaluate these design choices through extensive

Abstract: We present the first evaluation harness that enables any out-of-the-box,
local, Large Language Models (LLMs) to play full-press Diplomacy without
fine-tuning or specialized training. Previous work required frontier LLMs, or
fine-tuning, due to the high complexity and information density of Diplomacy's
game state. Combined with the high variance of matches, these factors made
Diplomacy prohibitive for study. In this work, we used data-driven iteration to
optimize a textual game state representation such that a 24B model can reliably
complete matches without any fine tuning. We develop tooling to facilitate
hypothesis testing and statistical analysis, and we present case studies on
persuasion, aggressive playstyles, and performance across a range of models. We
conduct a variety of experiments across many popular LLMs, finding the larger
models perform the best, but the smaller models still play adequately. We also
introduce Critical State Analysis: an experimental protocol for rapidly
iterating and analyzing key moments in a game at depth. Our harness
democratizes the evaluation of strategic reasoning in LLMs by eliminating the
need for fine-tuning, and it provides insights into how these capabilities
emerge naturally from widely used LLMs. Our code is available in the supplement
and will be open sourced.

### [44] [MCPToolBench++: A Large Scale AI Agent Model Context Protocol MCP Tool Use Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07575)
*Shiqing Fan,Xichen Ding,Liang Zhang,Linjian Mo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了MCPToolBench++，一个用于评估LLMs在调用MCP工具时性能的大规模多领域基准，解决了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs和AI代理在MCP工具使用能力评估中存在数据集不全面、响应格式多样、成功率不稳定以及上下文窗口限制等问题。

Method: 通过构建MCPToolBench++基准，整合了来自40多个类别的4k多个MCP服务器数据，涵盖单步和多步工具调用。

Result: 评估了具有代理能力的SOTA LLMs，并报告了结果。

Conclusion: MCPToolBench++为评估LLMs在MCP工具调用中的性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various
data sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include
search, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,
etc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized
method. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply
context to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use
abilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive
datasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse
formats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the
difficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks
with high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the
success rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across
different MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the
number of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the
textual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an
LLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'
performance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,
multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is
build upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,
collected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities. The datasets
consist of both single-step and multi-step tool calls across different
categories. We evaluated SOTA LLMs with agentic abilities on this benchmark and
reported the results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HGMF是一种概率剪枝方法，通过分层高斯混合模型提高LLM工具选择的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在大规模分层工具库中选择正确工具的挑战，减少噪声和计算成本。

Method: HGMF将查询和工具描述映射到统一语义空间，分两阶段进行高斯混合模型聚类和过滤。

Result: 实验表明HGMF显著提高了工具选择准确性并降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: HGMF为大规模工具库提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Invoking external tools enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
complex, real-world tasks, yet selecting the correct tool from large,
hierarchically-structured libraries remains a significant challenge. The
limited context windows of LLMs and noise from irrelevant options often lead to
low selection accuracy and high computational costs. To address this, we
propose the Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Framework (HGMF), a probabilistic
pruning method for scalable tool invocation. HGMF first maps the user query and
all tool descriptions into a unified semantic space. The framework then
operates in two stages: it clusters servers using a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and filters them based on the query's likelihood. Subsequently, it
applies the same GMM-based clustering and filtering to the tools associated
with the selected servers. This hierarchical process produces a compact,
high-relevance candidate set, simplifying the final selection task for the LLM.
Experiments on a public dataset show that HGMF significantly improves tool
selection accuracy while reducing inference latency, confirming the framework's
scalability and effectiveness for large-scale tool libraries.

*Aswin RRV,Jacob Dineen,Divij Handa,Md Nayem Uddin,Mihir Parmar,Chitta Baral,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出ThinkTuning方法，通过教师模型的反馈指导学生模型，提升其推理能力，实验显示在多任务基准上有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）能激发模型的自反思行为，但研究表明其仅能挖掘已有能力，无法真正培养新推理能力。因此，如何训练不具备此类行为的模型成为关键问题。

Method: 提出ThinkTuning方法，基于GRPO框架，通过教师模型对学生模型的输出提供反馈，模拟课堂教学中的问题解答与纠正过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准上平均提升3.85%，在MATH-500、AIME和GPQA-Diamond任务上分别提升2.08%、2.23%和3.99%。

Conclusion: ThinkTuning通过教师模型的隐式监督有效提升学生模型的推理能力，为模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking
LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL
drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)
shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it
merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a
question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior
to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a
GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a
student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from
classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the
student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the
mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback
reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct
solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through
feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning
capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows
a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on
MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements
over the vanilla-GRPO baseline. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出利用多模态AI技术改进家禽福利监测，通过特征级融合策略实现高效、可扩展的解决方案，并引入新评估工具和部署框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统家禽福利监测依赖主观人工观察和单一传感器数据，无法全面反映现代农场中蛋鸡的多维福利状况。

Method: 采用多模态AI技术，整合视觉、声音、环境和生理数据，提出特征级融合策略，并开发了领域转移评分（DTS）和数据可靠性指数（DRI）作为评估工具。

Result: 特征级融合策略在真实农场条件下表现最佳，新工具和框架提高了模型适应性和数据质量。

Conclusion: 多模态AI为家禽福利监测提供了从被动到主动、精准化的转变基础，结合生产效率和科学伦理。

Abstract: The future of poultry production depends on a paradigm shift replacing
subjective, labor-intensive welfare checks with data-driven, intelligent
monitoring ecosystems. Traditional welfare assessments-limited by human
observation and single-sensor data-cannot fully capture the complex,
multidimensional nature of laying hen welfare in modern farms. Multimodal
Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a breakthrough, integrating visual,
acoustic, environmental, and physiological data streams to reveal deeper
insights into avian welfare dynamics. This investigation highlights multimodal
As transformative potential, showing that intermediate (feature-level) fusion
strategies achieve the best balance between robustness and performance under
real-world poultry conditions, and offer greater scalability than early or late
fusion approaches. Key adoption barriers include sensor fragility in harsh farm
environments, high deployment costs, inconsistent behavioral definitions, and
limited cross-farm generalizability. To address these, we introduce two novel
evaluation tools - the Domain Transfer Score (DTS) to measure model
adaptability across diverse farm settings, and the Data Reliability Index (DRI)
to assess sensor data quality under operational constraints. We also propose a
modular, context-aware deployment framework designed for laying hen
environments, enabling scalable and practical integration of multimodal
sensing. This work lays the foundation for a transition from reactive, unimodal
monitoring to proactive, precision-driven welfare systems that unite
productivity with ethical, science based animal care.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkillNav是一个模块化框架，通过引入基于技能的推理提升Transformer-based VLN代理的性能，在R2R和GSA-R2R基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN方法在复杂空间和时间推理任务中泛化能力不足，SkillNav旨在通过模块化和技能分解解决这一问题。

Method: 将导航任务分解为可解释的原子技能（如垂直移动、区域识别等），每个技能由专门代理处理，并使用VLM-based路由器动态选择代理。

Result: 在R2R基准测试中达到新SOTA，并在GSA-R2R中展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkillNav通过模块化和技能分解显著提升了VLN任务的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges in enabling
agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D
environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training
and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen
scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is
required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that
introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents.
Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills
(e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each
handled by a specialized agent. We then introduce a novel zero-shot
Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most
suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations
and historical actions. SkillNav achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on
the R2R benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization to the GSA-R2R
benchmark that includes novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

*Jie Li,Haoye Dong,Zhengyang Wu,Zetao Zheng,Mingrong Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiMuST是一种基于解耦表示学习的POI推荐模型，通过多路时空转换图和社会关系提升推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通常单独建模时空转换，导致关键节点表示不一致，引入冗余信息并降低模型可解释性。

Method: 提出DiMuST模型，使用解耦变分多路图自动编码器（DAE），分离共享和私有分布，并通过PoE机制融合共享特征，同时用对比约束去噪私有特征。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，DiMuST在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiMuST能有效捕捉POI的时空转换表示，同时保持其时空关系的内在相关性。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a research hotspot in business
intelligence, where users' spatial-temporal transitions and social
relationships play key roles. However, most existing works model spatial and
temporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the
same spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant
information during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing
interpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced
POI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over
multiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel
Disentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first
disentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex
spatial-temporal graph strategy. It then fuses the shared features via a
Product of Experts (PoE) mechanism and denoises the private features through
contrastive constraints. The model effectively captures the spatial-temporal
transition representations of POIs while preserving the intrinsic correlation
of their spatial-temporal relationships. Experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that our DiMuST significantly outperforms existing methods
across multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决交互式环境中大语言模型（LLMs）处理多源信息时的隐私问题。

Method: 引入多智能体框架，将隐私推理分解为提取、分类等子任务，并通过信息流拓扑分析错误传播。

Result: 在ConfAIde和PrivacyLens基准测试中，多智能体配置显著减少隐私泄漏（GPT-4o下分别降低18%和19%）。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统的信息流设计在LLMs的上下文隐私保护中具有潜力。

Abstract: Addressing contextual privacy concerns remains challenging in interactive
settings where large language models (LLMs) process information from multiple
sources (e.g., summarizing meetings with private and public information). We
introduce a multi-agent framework that decomposes privacy reasoning into
specialized subtasks (extraction, classification), reducing the information
load on any single agent while enabling iterative validation and more reliable
adherence to contextual privacy norms. To understand how privacy errors emerge
and propagate, we conduct a systematic ablation over information-flow
topologies, revealing when and why upstream detection mistakes cascade into
downstream leakage. Experiments on the ConfAIde and PrivacyLens benchmark with
several open-source and closed-sourced LLMs demonstrate that our best
multi-agent configuration substantially reduces private information leakage
(\textbf{18\%} on ConfAIde and \textbf{19\%} on PrivacyLens with GPT-4o) while
preserving the fidelity of public content, outperforming single-agent
baselines. These results highlight the promise of principled information-flow
design in multi-agent systems for contextual privacy with LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EMPATHIA是一个多智能体框架，旨在解决难民整合中的文化、情感和伦理问题，通过三个模块（SEED、RISE、THRIVE）实现透明和可解释的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在难民整合中过于关注就业等狭窄目标，忽视了文化、情感和伦理等长期成功的关键维度。

Method: 基于Kegan的建构发展理论，EMPATHIA分为三个模块：SEED（初始安置）、RISE（早期独立）和THRIVE（持续成果），采用多智能体透明决策架构。

Result: 在联合国Kakuma数据集上实验，验证收敛率达87.4%，并在五个东道国实现了可解释的评估。

Conclusion: EMPATHIA通过平衡文化、情感和伦理因素，为AI驱动的分配任务提供了通用框架，支持人机协作而非替代。

Abstract: Current AI approaches to refugee integration optimize narrow objectives such
as employment and fail to capture the cultural, emotional, and ethical
dimensions critical for long-term success. We introduce EMPATHIA (Enriched
Multimodal Pathways for Agentic Thinking in Humanitarian Immigrant Assistance),
a multi-agent framework addressing the central Creative AI question: how do we
preserve human dignity when machines participate in life-altering decisions?
Grounded in Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, EMPATHIA decomposes
integration into three modules: SEED (Socio-cultural Entry and Embedding
Decision) for initial placement, RISE (Rapid Integration and Self-sufficiency
Engine) for early independence, and THRIVE (Transcultural Harmony and
Resilience through Integrated Values and Engagement) for sustained outcomes.
SEED employs a selector-validator architecture with three specialized agents -
emotional, cultural, and ethical - that deliberate transparently to produce
interpretable recommendations. Experiments on the UN Kakuma dataset (15,026
individuals, 7,960 eligible adults 15+ per ILO/UNHCR standards) and
implementation on 6,359 working-age refugees (15+) with 150+ socioeconomic
variables achieved 87.4% validation convergence and explainable assessments
across five host countries. EMPATHIA's weighted integration of cultural,
emotional, and ethical factors balances competing value systems while
supporting practitioner-AI collaboration. By augmenting rather than replacing
human expertise, EMPATHIA provides a generalizable framework for AI-driven
allocation tasks where multiple values must be reconciled.

TL;DR: 论文提出Ethics2Vec方法，通过向量化代理决策策略来评估其与人类价值观的一致性，解决AI伦理对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理的行为中隐含的伦理价值难以从人类角度理解，尤其是在涉及不可衡量或不可比较的价值观时（如生命价值与治疗成本）。

Method: 扩展Anything2vec方法，将代理决策策略映射为多元向量表示，用于比较和评估与人类价值观的对齐程度。

Result: 在二元决策和自动驾驶等自动控制场景中展示了Ethics2Vec方法的可行性。

Conclusion: Ethics2Vec为AI伦理对齐提供了一种量化方法，适用于多种决策和控制场景。

Abstract: Though intelligent agents are supposed to improve human experience (or make
it more efficient), it is hard from a human perspective to grasp the ethical
values which are explicitly or implicitly embedded in an agent behaviour. This
is the well-known problem of alignment, which refers to the challenge of
designing AI systems that align with human values, goals and preferences. This
problem is particularly challenging since most human ethical considerations
refer to \emph{incommensurable} (i.e. non-measurable and/or incomparable)
values and criteria. Consider, for instance, a medical agent prescribing a
treatment to a cancerous patient. How could it take into account (and/or weigh)
incommensurable aspects like the value of a human life and the cost of the
treatment? Now, the alignment between human and artificial values is possible
only if we define a common space where a metric can be defined and used. This
paper proposes to extend to ethics the conventional Anything2vec approach,
which has been successful in plenty of similar and hard-to-quantify domains
(ranging from natural language processing to recommendation systems and graph
analysis). This paper proposes a way to map an automatic agent decision-making
(or control law) strategy to a multivariate vector representation, which can be
used to compare and assess the alignment with human values. The Ethics2Vec
method is first introduced in the case of an automatic agent performing binary
decision-making. Then, a vectorisation of an automatic control law (like in the
case of a self-driving car) is discussed to show how the approach can be
extended to automatic control settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在自动规划中表现不佳，主要由于任务对称性导致组合爆炸，难以高效学习。

Method: 结合对比学习目标和架构改进，使Transformer能够感知对称性，适用于规划生成或启发式预测。

Result: 在多个规划领域中，对称感知训练有效且高效地解决了PlanGPT的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过对称感知训练，Transformer在自动规划中的性能得到显著提升。

Abstract: While transformers excel in many settings, their application in the field of
automated planning is limited. Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art
decoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard
planning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks
can be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond
being identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent
representations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We
propose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers
symmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.
Combining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can
be efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our
results across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware
training effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RMDPs方法在计算最优鲁棒策略时，可能产生多个等效策略，但这些策略在非对抗性转移概率下表现不同。因此，需要一种更精细的策略选择标准。

Method: 提出ORBE策略，结合了博弈论中的支配和最佳努力概念，通过改进的鲁棒值迭代算法计算。

Result: 证明了ORBE策略的存在性，并展示了其计算可行性。

Conclusion: ORBE策略为最优鲁棒策略提供了原则性的选择标准，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We study the common generalization of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
sets of transition probabilities, known as robust MDPs (RMDPs). A standard goal
in RMDPs is to compute a policy that maximizes the expected return under an
adversarial choice of the transition probabilities. If the uncertainty in the
probabilities is independent between the states, known as s-rectangularity,
such optimal robust policies can be computed efficiently using robust value
iteration. However, there might still be multiple optimal robust policies,
which, while equivalent with respect to the worst-case, reflect different
expected returns under non-adversarial choices of the transition probabilities.
Hence, we propose a refined policy selection criterion for RMDPs, drawing
inspiration from the notions of dominance and best-effort in game theory.
Instead of seeking a policy that only maximizes the worst-case expected return,
we additionally require the policy to achieve a maximal expected return under
different (i.e., not fully adversarial) transition probabilities. We call such
a policy an optimal robust best-effort (ORBE) policy. We prove that ORBE
policies always exist, characterize their structure, and present an algorithm
to compute them with a small overhead compared to standard robust value
iteration. ORBE policies offer a principled tie-breaker among optimal robust
policies. Numerical experiments show the feasibility of our approach.

Conclusion: 知识图谱和AI技术能有效提升急救效率和准确性。

Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has
increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or
health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first
responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and
save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and
optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients
condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency
situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and
medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and
recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot
calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to
improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this
article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an
innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment
recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the
situation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在结合大语言模型和进化算法时，通常演化单个解，导致LLM调用成本高昂。X-evolve旨在通过演化解空间来降低这一成本并提高搜索效率。

Method: X-evolve通过LLM生成可调程序，其中某些代码片段作为参数定义解空间，随后利用基于分数的搜索算法高效探索这一参数化空间。

Result: 在三个优化问题中验证了X-evolve的有效性：发现更大的部分可容许集（cap set问题）、更大的独立集（信息论问题），以及生成优于标准策略的启发式算法（在线装箱问题）。

Conclusion: X-evolve通过演化解空间显著提高了搜索效率，为高维优化问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While combining large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) shows promise for solving complex optimization problems, current
approaches typically evolve individual solutions, often incurring high LLM call
costs. We introduce \(X\)-evolve, a paradigm-shifting method that instead
evolves solution spaces \(X\) (sets of individual solutions) - subsets of the
overall search space \(S\). In \(X\)-evolve, LLMs generate tunable programs
wherein certain code snippets, designated as parameters, define a tunable
solution space. A score-based search algorithm then efficiently explores this
parametrically defined space, guided by feedback from objective function
scores. This strategy enables broader and more efficient exploration, which can
potentially accelerate convergence at a much lower search cost, requiring up to
two orders of magnitude fewer LLM calls than prior leading methods. We
demonstrate \(X\)-evolve's efficacy across three distinct hard optimization
problems. For the cap set problem, we discover a larger partial admissible set,
establishing a new tighter asymptotic lower bound for the cap set constant (\(C
\ge 2.2203\)). In information theory, we uncover a larger independent set for
the 15-vertex cycle graph (\(\mathcal{C}_{15}^{\boxtimes 5}\), size 19,946),
thereby raising the known lower bound on its Shannon capacity. Furthermore, for
the NP-hard online bin packing problem, we generate heuristics that
consistently outperform standard strategies across established benchmarks. By
evolving solution spaces, our method considerably improves search
effectiveness, making it possible to tackle high-dimensional problems that were
previously computationally prohibitive.

Motivation: 在无通信或标识的受限环境中，减少机器人碰撞并提高稳定性。

Method: 使用LSTM预测机器人位置，动态调整DQN奖励以定义碰撞风险。

Result: 在1Hz采样频率下，碰撞次数显著减少，稳定性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法计算成本低，适合嵌入式系统实现。

Abstract: This article proposes a collision risk anticipation method based on
short-term prediction of the agents position. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of
each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk
by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent.
The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move
without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1
Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a
stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally
inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded
systems.

decomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a
Memory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver
for conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations
across diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI
systems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death
conclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic
regions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior
pathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,
with improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT
is the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering
scalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.
By integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance
equitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical
capacity constraints in forensic systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的不确定性感知框架，用于解析Fedspeak并分类其隐含的货币政策立场，结合领域特定推理和动态不确定性解码模块，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fedspeak作为美联储的策略性语言工具，对市场预期和经济条件有重要影响，自动解析Fedspeak对金融预测和政策分析具有高价值。

Method: 采用LLM框架，结合货币政策传导机制的领域特定推理，并引入动态不确定性解码模块以评估预测置信度。

Result: 实验表明该框架在政策立场分析任务中达到最先进性能，且感知不确定性与模型错误率显著正相关。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了分类准确性和模型可靠性，还验证了感知不确定性作为诊断信号的有效性。

Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal
Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to
shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic
conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a
high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting,
algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose
an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and
classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the
semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate
domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess
the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification
accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis
task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation
between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the
effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study a fitting problem inspired by ontology-mediated querying: given a
collection
  of positive and negative examples of
  the form $(\mathcal{A},q)$ with
  $\mathcal{A}$ an ABox and $q$ a Boolean query, we seek
  an ontology $\mathcal{O}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O} \vDash
q$ for all positive examples and $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{O}\not\vDash q$ for
all negative examples.
  We consider the description logics $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$ as
ontology languages and
  a range of query languages that
  includes atomic queries (AQs), conjunctive queries (CQs), and unions thereof
(UCQs).
  For all of the resulting fitting problems,
  we provide
  effective characterizations and determine the computational complexity
  of deciding whether a fitting ontology exists. This problem turns out to be
${\small CO}NP$ for AQs and full CQs
  and $2E{\small XP}T{\small IME}$-complete for CQs and UCQs.
  These results hold for both $\mathcal{ALC}$ and $\mathcal{ALCI}$.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态模板或手动设计工作流，限制了适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: AdaptFlow通过语言引导的修改实现强泛化能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided
modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both
manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Dempster-Shafer理论的开放世界信息融合方法FNBT，解决异构框架下的证据融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，数据或模型常来自不同区域或组织，导致异构框架，传统融合方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出FNBT方法，通过扩展框架和全否定机制转换质量函数，使现有组合规则适用于异构框架。

Result: 理论证明FNBT满足质量函数不变性、遗传性和冲突消除性；实验显示其在分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FNBT方法有效解决了异构框架下的信息融合问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence has been widely applied in the field
of information fusion under uncertainty. Most existing research focuses on
combining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world
scenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or
organizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different
data sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to
heterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield
unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an
open-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief
Transformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a
criterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the
open-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate
elements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is
employed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules
can be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.
Theoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which
are formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential
conflict elimination. Empirically, FNBT demonstrates superior performance in
pattern classification tasks on real-world datasets and successfully resolves
Zadeh's counterexample, thereby validating its practical effectiveness.

Motivation: 将人类团队协作的理论应用于多智能体系统，以提升医疗决策的准确性和协作效率。

Method: 基于Salas的'Big Five'模型，实现六个团队协作组件（如团队领导力、共享心智模型等），并通过模块化架构评估不同任务和领域的需求。

Result: 在8个医疗基准测试中，7个表现提升，并通过消融实验揭示了不同任务的最优协作配置。

Conclusion: TeamMedAgents为关键决策领域提供了基于证据的多智能体系统设计基础，推动了协作AI的发展。

Abstract: We present TeamMedAgents, a novel multi-agent approach that systematically
integrates evidence-based teamwork components from human-human collaboration
into medical decision-making with large language models (LLMs). Our approach
validates an organizational psychology teamwork model from human collaboration
to computational multi-agent medical systems by operationalizing six core
teamwork components derived from Salas et al.'s "Big Five" model: team
leadership, mutual performance monitoring, team orientation, shared mental
models, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust. We implement and evaluate
these components as modular, configurable mechanisms within an adaptive
collaboration architecture while assessing the effect of the number of agents
involved based on the task's requirements and domain. Systematic evaluation of
computational implementations of teamwork behaviors across eight medical
benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU-Pro Medical, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets,
Path-VQA, and PMC-VQA) demonstrates consistent improvements across 7 out of 8
evaluated datasets. Controlled ablation studies conducted on 50 questions per
configuration across 3 independent runs provide mechanistic insights into
individual component contributions, revealing optimal teamwork configurations
that vary by reasoning task complexity and domain-specific requirements. Our
ablation analyses reveal dataset-specific optimal teamwork configurations,
indicating that different medical reasoning modalities benefit from distinct
collaborative patterns. TeamMedAgents represents an advancement in
collaborative AI by providing a systematic translation of established teamwork
theories from human collaboration into agentic collaboration, establishing a
foundation for evidence-based multi-agent system design in critical
decision-making domains.

Motivation: 现有监督防御方法依赖标记数据，不适用于实际场景。

Method: 采用分层代理编码器和基于噪声注入的对比学习检测恶意代理。

Result: 实验表明BlindGuard能有效检测多种攻击类型，且泛化性强。

Conclusion: BlindGuard为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且通用的防御方案。

Abstract: The security of LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) is critically threatened
by propagation vulnerability, where malicious agents can distort collective
decision-making through inter-agent message interactions. While existing
supervised defense methods demonstrate promising performance, they may be
impractical in real-world scenarios due to their heavy reliance on labeled
malicious agents to train a supervised malicious detection model. To enable
practical and generalizable MAS defenses, in this paper, we propose BlindGuard,
an unsupervised defense method that learns without requiring any
attack-specific labels or prior knowledge of malicious behaviors. To this end,
we establish a hierarchical agent encoder to capture individual, neighborhood,
and global interaction patterns of each agent, providing a comprehensive
understanding for malicious agent detection. Meanwhile, we design a
corruption-guided detector that consists of directional noise injection and
contrastive learning, allowing effective detection model training solely on
normal agent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that BlindGuard effectively
detects diverse attack types (i.e., prompt injection, memory poisoning, and
tool attack) across MAS with various communication patterns while maintaining
superior generalizability compared to supervised baselines. The code is

Conclusion: 结合AI与传统优化框架，可高效连接高层问题描述与可执行数学模型，提升能源系统决策效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted agent
that automatically converts natural-language descriptions of power system
optimization scenarios into compact, solver-ready formulations and generates
corresponding solutions. In contrast to approaches that rely solely on LLM to
produce solutions directly, the proposed method focuses on discovering a
mathematically compatible formulation that can be efficiently solved by
off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Directly using LLMs to produce solutions
often leads to infeasible or suboptimal results, as these models lack the
numerical precision and constraint-handling capabilities of established
optimization solvers. The pipeline integrates a domain-aware prompt and schema
with an LLM, enforces feasibility through systematic validation and iterative
repair, and returns both solver-ready models and user-facing results. Using the
unit commitment problem as a representative case study, the agent produces
optimal or near-optimal schedules along with the associated objective costs.
Results demonstrate that coupling the solver with task-specific validation
significantly enhances solution reliability. This work shows that combining AI
with established optimization frameworks bridges high-level problem
descriptions and executable mathematical models, enabling more efficient
decision-making in energy systems

Motivation: 由于虚假信息传播速度快于人工核查能力，且葡萄牙语缺乏整合外部证据的公开数据集，亟需开发更强大的自动事实核查系统。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）提取文本主要主张，并通过搜索引擎API检索相关外部证据，同时引入数据验证和预处理框架。

Result: 开发了一种方法，成功丰富了葡萄牙语新闻语料库（如Fake.Br、COVID19.BR等），并提升了数据质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为葡萄牙语自动事实核查系统的开发提供了重要支持，填补了数据集的空白。

Abstract: The accelerated dissemination of disinformation often outpaces the capacity
for manual fact-checking, highlighting the urgent need for Semi-Automated
Fact-Checking (SAFC) systems. Within the Portuguese language context, there is
a noted scarcity of publicly available datasets that integrate external
evidence, an essential component for developing robust AFC systems, as many
existing resources focus solely on classification based on intrinsic text
features. This dissertation addresses this gap by developing, applying, and
analyzing a methodology to enrich Portuguese news corpora (Fake.Br, COVID19.BR,
MuMiN-PT) with external evidence. The approach simulates a user's verification
process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash)
to extract the main claim from texts and search engine APIs (Google Search API,
Google FactCheck Claims Search API) to retrieve relevant external documents
(evidence). Additionally, a data validation and preprocessing framework,
including near-duplicate detection, is introduced to enhance the quality of the
base corpora.

Result: 动态提示显著提升性能，TF-IDF和SBERT检索方法在5-shot和10-shot设置中分别提高F1分数7.3%和5.6%。

Conclusion: 上下文自适应提示（RAG）在生物医学NER中具有显著效用。

Abstract: Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is a high-utility natural language
processing (NLP) task, and large language models (LLMs) show promise
particularly in few-shot settings (i.e., limited training data). In this
article, we address the performance challenges of LLMs for few-shot biomedical
NER by investigating a dynamic prompting strategy involving retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). In our approach, the annotated in-context learning examples
are selected based on their similarities with the input texts, and the prompt
is dynamically updated for each instance during inference. We implemented and
optimized static and dynamic prompt engineering techniques and evaluated them
on five biomedical NER datasets. Static prompting with structured components
increased average F1-scores by 12% for GPT-4, and 11% for GPT-3.5 and LLaMA
3-70B, relative to basic static prompting. Dynamic prompting further improved
performance, with TF-IDF and SBERT retrieval methods yielding the best results,
improving average F1-scores by 7.3% and 5.6% in 5-shot and 10-shot settings,
respectively. These findings highlight the utility of contextually adaptive
prompts via RAG for biomedical NER.

<details>

Motivation: 现有神经扩展定律忽略了LLM规模扩大带来的碳排放问题，亟需一种方法量化模型精度与碳足迹的关系。

Method: 通过整合神经扩展模型、GPU硬件演进、并行优化和碳排放估算，构建CarbonScaling框架。

Result: 结果显示精度与碳足迹存在幂律关系，但实际效率问题显著增加扩展因子；硬件技术对中小模型有效，但对超大LLM效果有限。

Conclusion: CarbonScaling为训练更可持续、碳效率更高的LLM提供了关键见解，优化如批量大小可缓解效率问题。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large
language models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter
count, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon
emissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents
\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling
laws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By
integrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism
optimization, and carbon estimation, \textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively
connects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a
power-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world
inefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology
scaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers
diminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and
underutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch
size scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \textit{CarbonScaling} offers
key insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 现有tokenizer在多语言环境下效率低下，尤其在印度语系等高复杂度脚本中表现不佳，亟需改进。

Result: 新tokenizer的token-to-word比率降低了6%，模型性能和推理速度均有显著提升。

Conclusion: tokenization是构建高效多语言LLM的关键因素之一。

Abstract: While model architecture and training objectives are well-studied,
tokenization, particularly in multilingual contexts, remains a relatively
neglected aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) development. Existing tokenizers
often exhibit high token-to-word ratios, inefficient use of context length, and
slower inference. We present a systematic study that links vocabulary size,
pre-tokenization rules, and training-corpus composition to both token-to-word
efficiency and model quality. To ground our analysis in a linguistically
diverse context, we conduct extensive experiments on Indic scripts, which
present unique challenges due to their high script diversity and orthographic
complexity. Drawing on the insights from these analyses, we propose a novel
algorithm for data composition that balances multilingual data for tokenizer
training. Our observations on pretokenization strategies significantly improve
model performance, and our data composition algorithm reduces the average
token-to-word ratio by approximately 6% with respect to the conventional data
randomization approach. Our tokenizer achieves more than 40% improvement on
average token-to-word ratio against stateof-the-art multilingual Indic models.
This improvement yields measurable gains in both model performance and
inference speed. This highlights tokenization alongside architecture and
training objectives as a critical lever for building efficient, scalable
multilingual LLMs

Method: 提取文本嵌入后，通过监督增强的自编码器学习低维任务相关潜在因子。

Result: AEALT在分类、异常检测和预测任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: AEALT显著优于原始嵌入和标准降维方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate text embeddings from text data,
producing vector representations that capture the semantic meaning and
contextual relationships of words. However, the high dimensionality of these
embeddings often impedes efficiency and drives up computational cost in
downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AutoEncoder-Augmented Learning
with Text (AEALT), a supervised, factor-augmented framework that incorporates
dimension reduction directly into pre-trained LLM workflows. First, we extract
embeddings from text documents; next, we pass them through a supervised
augmented autoencoder to learn low-dimensional, task-relevant latent factors.
By modeling the nonlinear structure of complex embeddings, AEALT outperforms
conventional deep-learning approaches that rely on raw embeddings. We validate
its broad applicability with extensive experiments on classification, anomaly
detection, and prediction tasks using multiple real-world public datasets.
Numerical results demonstrate that AEALT yields substantial gains over both
vanilla embeddings and several standard dimension reduction methods.

Method: 提出GuideEval基准，基于真实教育对话，通过感知、编排和激发三阶段行为框架评估教学指导能力，并引入行为引导的微调策略。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁从孤立内容评估转向以学习者为中心的交互范式，为苏格拉底式语言模型的评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant
promise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research
has primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often
overlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their
cognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the
broader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert
tutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'
understanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded
in authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through
a three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;
(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,
stimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs
frequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit
confusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided
finetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,
significantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from
isolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates
a more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型可能包含敏感、有害或受版权保护的知识，需要一种无需完全重新训练即可遗忘特定知识的方法。

Method: 通过结构化提示管道自动合成教科书风格的数据，仅需输入领域名称即可生成遗忘数据集。

Conclusion: 合成数据集为广泛领域的实用、可扩展遗忘学习提供了可行路径，无需人工干预。

Abstract: Modern large language models often encode sensitive, harmful, or copyrighted
knowledge, raising the need for post-hoc unlearning-the ability to remove
specific domains of knowledge from a model without full retraining. A major
bottleneck in current unlearning pipelines is constructing effective forget
sets-datasets that approximate the target domain and guide the model to forget
it. In this work, we introduce a scalable, automated approach to generate
high-quality forget sets using language models themselves. Our method
synthesizes textbook-style data through a structured prompting pipeline,
requiring only a domain name as input. Through experiments on unlearning
biosecurity, cybersecurity, and Harry Potter novels, we show that our synthetic
datasets consistently outperform the baseline synthetic alternatives and are
comparable to the expert-curated ones. Additionally, ablation studies reveal
that the multi-step generation pipeline significantly boosts data diversity,
which in turn improves unlearning utility. Overall, our findings suggest that
synthetic datasets offer a promising path toward practical, scalable unlearning
for a wide range of emerging domains without the need for manual intervention.

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如BrowseComp）依赖动态且不透明的网络搜索API，导致公平性和透明度问题，无法准确评估深度研究LLM的能力。

Method: 通过固定且精心筛选的语料库构建BrowseComp-Plus，每个查询包含人工验证的支持文档和挑战性负面样本，支持受控实验。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-Plus为深度研究系统和检索方法提供了全面的评估框架，有助于分析检索效果、引用准确性和上下文工程。

Abstract: Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with
search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling
complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over
search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on
black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:
dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep
research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus
makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the
current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given
time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights
into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these
challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,
employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus
includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,
enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in
distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the
open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves
3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with
the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with
fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and
disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering
insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context
engineering in Deep-Research system.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了BPE推断算法对语言模型性能的影响，发现非目标性无合并列表算法对性能影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE合并列表可能暴露训练数据信息，研究探索不依赖合并列表的推断算法的下游影响。

Method: 研究两类BPE推断方案：目标性偏离合并列表（如随机合并顺序）和非目标性无合并列表算法（如贪婪或精确压缩文本）。

Result: 目标性偏离显著降低性能，而非目标性算法对性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 无合并列表的简化分词方案可行且可能更隐私保护。

Abstract: Standard Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization compresses text by pairing a
learned token vocabulary with a detailed merge list. Recent work has shown that
this merge list exposes a potential attack surface for extracting information
about language model's training data. In this paper, we explore the downstream
impact of BPE inference algorithms that do not rely on this merge list at all,
and hence differ from the encoding process during BPE training. To address this
question, we investigate two broad classes of BPE inference schemes that differ
from BPE application during training: a) targeted deviation from merge-lists
including random merge orders, and various corruptions of merge list involving
deletion/truncation, and b) non-targeted BPE inference algorithms that do not
depend on the merge list but focus on compressing the text either greedily or
exactly. Extensive experiments across diverse language modeling tasks like
accuracy-based QA benchmarks, machine translation, and open-ended generation
reveal that while targeted deviation from the merge lists exhibits significant
degradation in language model performance, the non-targeted merge-list-free
inference algorithms result in minimal impact on downstream performance that is
often much smaller than expected. These findings pave way for simpler and
potentially more privacy-preserving tokenization schemes that do not
catastrophically compromise model performance.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在生成内容中可能表现出的两种偏差及其潜在风险。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均对多群体表现出显著的刻板印象偏差和偏离偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在推断用户属性时的偏差问题及其潜在危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across diverse domains,
raising concerns about their limitations and potential risks. In this study, we
investigate two types of bias that LLMs may display: stereotype bias and
deviation bias. Stereotype bias refers to when LLMs consistently associate
specific traits with a particular demographic group. Deviation bias reflects
the disparity between the demographic distributions extracted from
LLM-generated content and real-world demographic distributions. By asking four
advanced LLMs to generate profiles of individuals, we examine the associations
between each demographic group and attributes such as political affiliation,
religion, and sexual orientation. Our experimental results show that all
examined LLMs exhibit both significant stereotype bias and deviation bias
towards multiple groups. Our findings uncover the biases that occur when LLMs
infer user attributes and shed light on the potential harms of LLM-generated
outputs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLMs在Kanuri语言翻译中的表现，发现平行句子是最有效的数据源，而语法单独使用效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kanuri语言虽然有大量使用者，但数字资源匮乏，研究旨在探索如何通过语言资源提升LLM的翻译质量。

Method: 设计了两个数据集（健康和通用术语），测试不同语言资源（语法、词典、平行句子）对LLM翻译的影响，并与人工翻译对比。

Result: 平行句子效果最佳，语法虽优于零样本翻译，但单独使用效果不佳；LLM在准确性上优于流畅性。

Conclusion: LLM翻译评估需多维指标，语法单独使用不足以支持有效的领域特定翻译。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art models demonstrate capacity to leverage in-context
learning to translate into previously unseen language contexts. Tanzer et al.
[2024] utilize language materials (e.g. a grammar) to improve translation
quality for Kalamang using large language models (LLMs). We focus on Kanuri, a
language that, despite having substantial speaker population, has minimal
digital resources. We design two datasets for evaluation: one focused on health
and humanitarian terms, and another containing generalized terminology,
investigating how domain-specific tasks impact LLM translation quality.
  By providing different combinations of language resources (grammar,
dictionary, and parallel sentences), we measure LLM translation effectiveness,
comparing results to native speaker translations and human linguist
performance. We evaluate using both automatic metrics and native speaker
assessments of fluency and accuracy.
  Results demonstrate that parallel sentences remain the most effective data
source, outperforming other methods in human evaluations and automatic metrics.
While incorporating grammar improves over zero-shot translation, it fails as an
effective standalone data source. Human evaluations reveal that LLMs achieve
accuracy (meaning) more effectively than fluency (grammaticality).
  These findings suggest LLM translation evaluation benefits from
multidimensional assessment beyond simple accuracy metrics, and that grammar
alone, without parallel sentences, does not provide sufficient context for
effective domain-specific translation.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在链式思考提示下的偏见表现，验证偏见模型是否具有偏见思考。

Method: 对5种流行大型语言模型进行实验，使用公平性指标量化11种偏见。

Result: 模型思考步骤的偏见与输出偏见的相关系数低于0.6，且p值显著。

Conclusion: 与人类不同，测试的模型即使有偏见决策，其思考步骤未必有偏见。

Abstract: The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the
presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical
appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models
challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a
recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it
responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:
\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we
conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics
to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our
results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with
the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than
$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models
with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.

Result: 实验显示，模型规模和提示技术的提升能显著提高性能，32B开源模型在标准提示下性能接近GPT系列。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中部署模式感知代理提供了一种可扩展且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Enterprise data pipelines, characterized by complex transformations across
multiple programming languages, often cause a semantic disconnect between
original metadata and downstream data. This "semantic drift" compromises data
reproducibility and governance, and impairs the utility of services like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and text-to-SQL systems. To address this,
a novel framework is proposed for the automated extraction of fine-grained
schema lineage from multilingual enterprise pipeline scripts. This method
identifies four key components: source schemas, source tables, transformation
logic, and aggregation operations, creating a standardized representation of
data transformations. For the rigorous evaluation of lineage quality, this
paper introduces the Schema Lineage Composite Evaluation (SLiCE), a metric that
assesses both structural correctness and semantic fidelity. A new benchmark is
also presented, comprising 1,700 manually annotated lineages from real-world
industrial scripts. Experiments were conducted with 12 language models, from
1.3B to 32B small language models (SLMs) to large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1. The results demonstrate that the performance of schema
lineage extraction scales with model size and the sophistication of prompting
techniques. Specially, a 32B open-source model, using a single reasoning trace,
can achieve performance comparable to the GPT series under standard prompting.
This finding suggests a scalable and economical approach for deploying
schema-aware agents in practical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统计框架，用于识别和量化大语言模型（LLM）作为评委时的自我偏见（self-bias），并通过实验验证了某些模型（如GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）存在系统性评分偏高的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评委时可能对其自身输出评分过高（自我偏见），这会影响模型性能的真实评估。现有研究常将模型质量差异与偏见混淆，或错误假设LLM与人类评分分布相同。

Method: 提出统计框架，建模LLM评委对自身与其他模型输出的评分分布差异，同时考虑独立第三方评委（如人类）的评分质量。

Result: 实验分析显示，某些模型（如GPT-4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）存在自我偏见和家族偏见（对同系列模型评分更高）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM评委的潜在问题，并提供了减少偏见的实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and
reliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically
assign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as
self-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous
studies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or
incorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating
distributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly
formalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.
Our method models the difference in the scoring distribution that
LLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while
accounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an
independent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and
quantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine
performance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical
analysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)
consisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM
judges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
systematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also
display family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs
produced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential
pitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases
when interpreting automated evaluations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）自动化标注日裔美国人监禁口述历史的语义和情感的框架，通过多阶段方法结合专家标注和模型评估，展示了LLM在敏感历史档案分析中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口述历史是记录系统性不公和历史抹除的重要资料，但其非结构化格式、情感复杂性和高标注成本限制了大规模分析。

Method: 使用LLM（如ChatGPT、Llama、Qwen）构建高质量数据集，评估零样本、少样本和RAG策略，结合专家标注和提示设计。

Result: ChatGPT在语义分类中表现最佳（F1 88.71%），Llama在情感分析中略优（82.66%）。成功标注了92,191句话。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计的提示，LLM可有效用于大规模口述历史的语义和情感标注，为数字人文领域提供了可复用的标注流程和伦理指导。

Abstract: Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within
communities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective
and efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and
understanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these
archives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional
complexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework
to automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American
Incarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,
evaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in
historically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert
annotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We
labeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic
classification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For
semantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),
followed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama
slightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models
showing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to
annotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our
findings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment
annotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed
prompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical
guidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By
bridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the
groundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities
and preservation of collective memory. GitHub:

Result: 揭示了多轮越狱攻击的新漏洞，为LLMs安全性研究提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区共同努力构建更安全的LLMs，并深入理解越狱攻击机制。

Abstract: Current jailbreaking work on large language models (LLMs) aims to elicit
unsafe outputs from given prompts. However, it only focuses on single-turn
jailbreaking targeting one specific query. On the contrary, the advanced LLMs
are designed to handle extremely long contexts and can thus conduct multi-turn
conversations. So, we propose exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, in which the
jailbroken LLMs are continuously tested on more than the first-turn
conversation or a single target query. This is an even more serious threat
because 1) it is common for users to continue asking relevant follow-up
questions to clarify certain jailbroken details, and 2) it is also possible
that the initial round of jailbreaking causes the LLMs to respond to additional
irrelevant questions consistently. As the first step (First draft done at June
2024) in exploring multi-turn jailbreaking, we construct a Multi-Turn Jailbreak
Benchmark (MTJ-Bench) for benchmarking this setting on a series of open- and
closed-source models and provide novel insights into this new safety threat. By
revealing this new vulnerability, we aim to call for community efforts to build
safer LLMs and pave the way for a more in-depth understanding of jailbreaking
LLMs.

Abstract: Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing
task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by
single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to
hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their
accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a
novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with
**D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The
core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which
utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform
a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning
chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs
the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled
architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating
complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%**
in Macro-F1 score.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have contributed to the
development of automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems that can correct
grammatical errors. However, while these systems are effective at improving
text, they are not optimally designed for language learning. They favor direct
revisions, often with a click-to-fix functionality that can be applied without
considering the reason for the correction. Meanwhile, depending on the error
type, learners may benefit most from simple explanations and strategically
indirect hints, especially on generalizable grammatical rules. To support the
generation of such feedback, we introduce an annotation framework that models
each error's error type and generalizability. For error type classification, we
introduce a typology focused on inferring learners' knowledge gaps by
connecting their errors to specific grammatical patterns. Following this
framework, we collect a dataset of annotated learner errors and corresponding
human-written feedback comments, each labeled as a direct correction or hint.
With this data, we evaluate keyword-guided, keyword-free, and template-guided
methods of generating feedback using large language models (LLMs). Human
teachers examined each system's outputs, assessing them on grounds including
relevance, factuality, and comprehensibility. We report on the development of
the dataset and the comparative performance of the systems investigated.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language
processing. It remains a research hotspot due to its wide applicability across
domains. Although recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved
NER performance, they rely heavily on large, high-quality annotated datasets.
However, building these datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing a
major bottleneck for further research. Current dataset merging approaches
mainly focus on strategies like manual label mapping or constructing label
graphs, which lack interpretability and scalability. To address this, we
propose an automatic label alignment method based on label similarity. The
method combines empirical and semantic similarities, using a greedy pairwise
merging strategy to unify label spaces across different datasets. Experiments
are conducted in two stages: first, merging three existing NER datasets into a
unified corpus with minimal impact on NER performance; second, integrating this
corpus with a small-scale, self-built dataset in the financial domain. The
results show that our method enables effective dataset merging and enhances NER
performance in the low-resource financial domain. This study presents an
efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating multi-source
NER corpora.

smart use of light-weight language models, with judicious fine-tuning. The demo
showcases the rich functionality for advanced user questions, and also offers
detailed tracking of how the answers are computed by the operators in the

Result: 在PERSONA-CHAT和ConvAI2数据集上的实验表明，SBS显著提升了角色一致性对话生成的效果。

Conclusion: SBS框架通过评分条件训练，有效提升了对话模型在角色一致性方面的表现。

Abstract: Persona-based dialogue generation is an important milestone towards building
conversational artificial intelligence. Despite the ever-improving capabilities
of large language models (LLMs), effectively integrating persona fidelity in
conversations remains challenging due to the limited diversity in existing
dialogue data. We propose a novel framework SBS (Score-Before-Speaking), which
outperforms previous methods and yields improvements for both million and
billion-parameter models. Unlike previous methods, SBS unifies the learning of
responses and their relative quality into a single step. The key innovation is
to train a dialogue model to correlate augmented responses with a quality score
during training and then leverage this knowledge at inference. We use
noun-based substitution for augmentation and semantic similarity-based scores
as a proxy for response quality. Through extensive experiments with benchmark
datasets (PERSONA-CHAT and ConvAI2), we show that score-conditioned training
allows existing models to better capture a spectrum of persona-consistent
dialogues. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that including scores in the
input prompt during training is superior to conventional training setups. Code

Conclusion: SentiDetect在检测LLM生成文本方面具有显著优势，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has resulted in
increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content, posing significant challenges
in distinguishing LLM-generated text from human-written language. Existing
detection methods, primarily based on lexical heuristics or fine-tuned
classifiers, often suffer from limited generalizability and are vulnerable to
paraphrasing, adversarial perturbations, and cross-domain shifts. In this work,
we propose SentiDetect, a model-agnostic framework for detecting LLM-generated
text by analyzing the divergence in sentiment distribution stability. Our
method is motivated by the empirical observation that LLM outputs tend to
exhibit emotionally consistent patterns, whereas human-written texts display
greater emotional variability. To capture this phenomenon, we define two
complementary metrics: sentiment distribution consistency and sentiment
distribution preservation, which quantify stability under sentiment-altering
and semantic-preserving transformations. We evaluate SentiDetect on five
diverse datasets and a range of advanced LLMs,including Gemini-1.5-Pro,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架，用于解决《古兰经》问答中的段落检索和答案提取问题，通过集成微调的阿拉伯语言模型和指令调优的大语言模型，取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于古典阿拉伯语的语言复杂性和宗教文本的语义丰富性，《古兰经》问答面临独特挑战，需要一种高效的方法来解决低资源环境下的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 集成微调的阿拉伯语言模型进行段落检索；2) 使用指令调优的大语言模型进行答案提取，结合少量样本提示。

Result: 在Quran QA 2023共享任务中，段落检索的MAP@10为0.3128，MRR@10为0.5763；答案提取的pAP@10为0.669，显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 结合模型集成和指令调优语言模型，能够有效解决专业领域中低资源问答的挑战。

Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic
complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In
this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage
retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned
Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer
extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot
prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task,
with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of
0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These
results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned
language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question
answering in specialized domains.

TL;DR: 提出一种渐进式训练方法，利用预训练模型实现高性能1-bit LLM量化，避免从头训练的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有1-bit量化方法需从头训练，成本高且精度下降严重，未能充分利用预训练模型。

Method: 采用一致渐进式训练，结合二进制感知初始化和双尺度补偿，平滑转换浮点权重为二值化权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，能在预训练模型基础上实现高性能1-bit量化。

Conclusion: 通过渐进式训练和优化技术，1-bit LLM量化可高效利用预训练模型，避免高成本从头训练。

Abstract: 1-bit LLM quantization offers significant advantages in reducing storage and
computational costs. However, existing methods typically train 1-bit LLMs from
scratch, failing to fully leverage pre-trained models. This results in high
training costs and notable accuracy degradation. We identify that the large gap
between full precision and 1-bit representations makes direct adaptation
difficult. In this paper, we introduce a consistent progressive training for
both forward and backward, smoothly converting the floating-point weights into
the binarized ones. Additionally, we incorporate binary-aware initialization
and dual-scaling compensation to reduce the difficulty of progressive training
and improve the performance. Experimental results on LLMs of various sizes
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our results show
that high-performance 1-bit LLMs can be achieved using pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for expensive training from scratch.

TL;DR: Vec2Summ是一种新颖的抽象摘要方法，通过语义压缩任务实现，利用语义嵌入空间的均值向量表示文档集合并生成流畅摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于LLM的摘要方法在上下文长度限制、生成可控性和扩展性方面的不足。

Method: 通过均值向量表示文档集合，利用生成语言模型进行嵌入反转，并引入高斯分布采样以提升重建质量。

Result: Vec2Summ能生成主题一致且高效的摘要，性能与直接LLM摘要相当，但细节较少。

Conclusion: Vec2Summ在扩展性、语义控制和语料库级抽象方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose Vec2Summ, a novel method for abstractive summarization that frames
the task as semantic compression. Vec2Summ represents a document collection
using a single mean vector in the semantic embedding space, capturing the
central meaning of the corpus. To reconstruct fluent summaries, we perform
embedding inversion -- decoding this mean vector into natural language using a
generative language model. To improve reconstruction quality and capture some
degree of topical variability, we introduce stochasticity by sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centered on the mean. This approach is loosely analogous
to bagging in ensemble learning, where controlled randomness encourages more
robust and varied outputs. Vec2Summ addresses key limitations of LLM-based
summarization methods. It avoids context-length constraints, enables
interpretable and controllable generation via semantic parameters, and scales
efficiently with corpus size -- requiring only $O(d + d^2)$ parameters.
Empirical results show that Vec2Summ produces coherent summaries for topically
focused, order-invariant corpora, with performance comparable to direct LLM
summarization in terms of thematic coverage and efficiency, albeit with less
fine-grained detail. These results underscore Vec2Summ's potential in settings
where scalability, semantic control, and corpus-level abstraction are
prioritized.

Motivation: 现有对话数据集大多忽略文化差异，而东南亚地区文化多样但资源匮乏，因此需要构建一个文化相关的数据集。

Method: 数据集包含8种语言的对话，涵盖6个东南亚国家，每个对话附带人物属性和两个文化相关主题。

Result: SEADialogues提供了多轮对话数据，支持文化敏感和以人为本的大语言模型研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集为东南亚地区的文化对话研究提供了重要资源，推动了文化敏感对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Although numerous datasets have been developed to support dialogue systems,

cultural relevance and personalization, each dialogue includes persona
attributes and two culturally grounded topics that reflect everyday life in the
respective communities. Furthermore, we release a multi-turn dialogue dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估基准（如BBQ）主要关注西方语境，缺乏对印度多语言和文化背景的适用性。

Method: 开发了BharatBBQ基准，涵盖8种印度语言和13个社会类别，通过翻译和验证扩展数据集，评估多语言模型的偏见。

Result: 研究发现多语言模型在印度语言中表现出更强的偏见，凸显了基于语言和文化背景的偏见评估的必要性。

Conclusion: BharatBBQ为印度多语言和文化背景的偏见评估提供了重要工具，揭示了模型偏见的普遍性和文化差异的影响。

Abstract: Evaluating social biases in language models (LMs) is crucial for ensuring
fairness and minimizing the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes in AI systems.
Existing benchmarks, such as the Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ),
primarily focus on Western contexts, limiting their applicability to the Indian
context. To address this gap, we introduce BharatBBQ, a culturally adapted
benchmark designed to assess biases in Hindi, English, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Odia, and Assamese. BharatBBQ covers 13 social categories, including 3
intersectional groups, reflecting prevalent biases in the Indian sociocultural
landscape. Our dataset contains 49,108 examples in one language that are
expanded using translation and verification to 392,864 examples in eight
different languages. We evaluate five multilingual LM families across zero and
few-shot settings, analyzing their bias and stereotypical bias scores. Our
findings highlight persistent biases across languages and social categories and
often amplified biases in Indian languages compared to English, demonstrating
the necessity of linguistically and culturally grounded benchmarks for bias
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LessIsMore是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力机制，通过全局注意力模式提升推理任务的效率和准确性，减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型因生成过多令牌导致的计算开销问题，同时避免现有稀疏注意力方法的准确性下降。

Method: 利用全局注意力模式，聚合局部注意力头的令牌选择，实现跨头的统一令牌排名，避免维护独立的令牌子集。

Result: 在多种推理任务中，LessIsMore保持甚至提升准确性，平均解码速度提升1.1倍，令牌关注数量减少2倍。

Conclusion: LessIsMore在提高效率的同时保持了准确性，优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve strong performance through test-time scaling
but incur substantial computational overhead, particularly from excessive token
generation when processing short input prompts. While sparse attention
mechanisms can reduce latency and memory usage, existing approaches suffer from
significant accuracy degradation due to accumulated errors during
long-generation reasoning. These methods generally require either high token
retention rates or expensive retraining. We introduce LessIsMore, a
training-free sparse attention mechanism for reasoning tasks, which leverages
global attention patterns rather than relying on traditional head-specific
local optimizations. LessIsMore aggregates token selections from local
attention heads with recent contextual information, enabling unified cross-head
token ranking for future decoding layers. This unified selection improves
generalization and efficiency by avoiding the need to maintain separate token
subsets per head. Evaluation across diverse reasoning tasks and benchmarks
shows that LessIsMore preserves -- and in some cases improves -- accuracy while
achieving a $1.1\times$ average decoding speed-up compared to full attention.
Moreover, LessIsMore attends to $2\times$ fewer tokens without accuracy loss,
achieving a $1.13\times$ end-to-end speed-up compared to existing sparse
attention methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在交叉性偏见中的表现，提出了新的评估基准WinoIdentity，并发现模型对弱势群体的不确定性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统可能反映并加剧社会偏见，尤其是在关键社会决策中。现有研究多关注单一维度的偏见评估，而忽略了交叉性偏见的影响。

Method: 通过扩展WinoBias数据集，创建包含25个人口统计标记的WinoIdentity基准，评估50种偏见模式。提出Coreference Confidence Disparity指标衡量模型对不同交叉性身份的置信度差异。

Result: 评估了五个LLMs，发现置信度差异高达40%，模型对反刻板印象中的双重弱势身份最不确定。

Conclusion: LLMs的优异表现可能源于记忆而非逻辑推理，其价值对齐和有效性存在独立缺陷，可能导致社会危害。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance, leading to
their widespread adoption as decision-support tools in resource-constrained
contexts like hiring and admissions. There is, however, scientific consensus
that AI systems can reflect and exacerbate societal biases, raising concerns
about identity-based harm when used in critical social contexts. Prior work has
laid a solid foundation for assessing bias in LLMs by evaluating demographic
disparities in different language reasoning tasks. In this work, we extend
single-axis fairness evaluations to examine intersectional bias, recognizing
that when multiple axes of discrimination intersect, they create distinct
patterns of disadvantage. We create a new benchmark called WinoIdentity by
augmenting the WinoBias dataset with 25 demographic markers across 10
attributes, including age, nationality, and race, intersected with binary
gender, yielding 245,700 prompts to evaluate 50 distinct bias patterns.
Focusing on harms of omission due to underrepresentation, we investigate bias
through the lens of uncertainty and propose a group (un)fairness metric called
Coreference Confidence Disparity which measures whether models are more or less
confident for some intersectional identities than others. We evaluate five
recently published LLMs and find confidence disparities as high as 40% along
various demographic attributes including body type, sexual orientation and
socio-economic status, with models being most uncertain about
doubly-disadvantaged identities in anti-stereotypical settings. Surprisingly,
coreference confidence decreases even for hegemonic or privileged markers,
indicating that the recent impressive performance of LLMs is more likely due to
memorization than logical reasoning. Notably, these are two independent
failures in value alignment and validity that can compound to cause social
harm.

Motivation: 研究ASR系统公平性的不足，揭示其误识别行为如何加剧历史不公。

Method: 通过哲学视角区分中性分类与有害歧视，分析ASR系统如何将前者转化为后者。

Result: 识别了ASR偏见的三个独特伦理维度，并指出现有技术公平性指标未能捕捉其不对称权力关系。

Conclusion: 解决ASR偏见需技术干预外，还需承认多样语音形式的合法性，以尊重语言多样性和说话者自主权。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems now mediate countless
human-technology interactions, yet research on their fairness implications
remains surprisingly limited. This paper examines ASR bias through a
philosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech
varieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form
of disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized
linguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification
(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how
ASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they
consistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique
ethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from
other algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of
non-standard varieties ("temporal taxation"), the disruption of conversational
flow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between
speech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric
power relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.
The paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism
in ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce
problematic language ideologies. We conclude that addressing ASR bias requires
more than technical interventions; it demands recognition of diverse speech
varieties as legitimate forms of expression worthy of technological
accommodation. This philosophical reframing offers new pathways for developing
ASR systems that respect linguistic diversity and speaker autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恶意样本比例增加时防御性能急剧下降，主要原因是用户任务梯度与安全目标梯度冲突。

Method: 提出SafeGrad，通过梯度投影消除冲突，并结合KL散度对齐损失增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明SafeGrad在多种LLM和数据集上提供最先进的防御，即使在高恶意比例下也能保持安全性和任务性能。

Conclusion: SafeGrad有效解决了安全微调中的梯度冲突问题，为LLM的安全对齐提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-Service introduces a critical vulnerability where a few
malicious examples mixed into the user's fine-tuning dataset can compromise the
safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). While a recognized paradigm
frames safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing
user task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are
critically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as
harmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting
gradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.
To resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient
surgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component
of the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the
alignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without
sacrificing safety. To further enhance robustness and data efficiency, we
employ a KL-divergence alignment loss that learns the rich, distributional
safety profile of the well-aligned foundation model. Extensive experiments show
that SafeGrad provides state-of-the-art defense across various LLMs and
datasets, maintaining robust safety even at high harmful ratios without
compromising task fidelity.

TL;DR: Omni-SafetyBench是首个针对全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）安全评估的并行基准测试，填补了现有评估工具的空白，揭示了OLLMs在复杂多模态输入下的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏专门评估全模态大语言模型（OLLMs）安全性的基准测试，且现有基准无法评估音频-视觉联合输入或跨模态安全一致性，因此需要开发新的评估工具。

Method: 提出了Omni-SafetyBench，包含24种模态组合和变体，每种972个样本，并设计了基于条件攻击成功率（C-ASR）、拒绝率（C-RR）和跨模态安全一致性评分（CMSC-score）的评估指标。

Result: 评估了6个开源和4个闭源OLLMs，发现关键漏洞：（1）无模型在整体安全性和一致性上表现优异；（2）复杂输入（尤其是音频-视觉联合）削弱安全防御；（3）某些模态下模型得分低至0.14。

Conclusion: Omni-SafetyBench和提出的指标揭示了OLLMs安全性的紧迫需求，为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual
and auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to
mitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for
OLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess
safety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety
consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24
modality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated
audio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with
complex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,
we propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success
Rate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and
a Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency
across modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals
critical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and
consistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top
performer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,
especially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models
scoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics
highlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for
future improvements.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了历史点击流中的个性化无关噪声，导致生成的标题偏离用户真实兴趣。

Method: PHG-DIF采用双阶段过滤去除噪声（如短停留时间和异常点击爆发），并通过多级时间融合动态建模用户兴趣。

Result: 实验表明PHG-DIF显著减少噪声影响，在DT-PENS数据集上达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: PHG-DIF通过去噪和动态兴趣建模，显著提升个性化标题生成质量。

Abstract: Accurate personalized headline generation hinges on precisely capturing user
interests from historical behaviors. However, existing methods neglect
personalized-irrelevant click noise in entire historical clickstreams, which
may lead to hallucinated headlines that deviate from genuine user preferences.
In this paper, we reveal the detrimental impact of click noise on personalized
generation quality through rigorous analysis in both user and news dimensions.
Based on these insights, we propose a novel Personalized Headline Generation
framework via Denoising Fake Interests from Implicit Feedback (PHG-DIF).
PHG-DIF first employs dual-stage filtering to effectively remove clickstream
noise, identified by short dwell times and abnormal click bursts, and then
leverages multi-level temporal fusion to dynamically model users' evolving and
multi-faceted interests for precise profiling. Moreover, we release DT-PENS, a
new benchmark dataset comprising the click behavior of 1,000 carefully curated
users and nearly 10,000 annotated personalized headlines with historical dwell
time annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHG-DIF substantially
mitigates the adverse effects of click noise and significantly improves
headline quality, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on DT-PENS. Our
framework implementation and dataset are available at

Result: 在时效性问答任务中，DySK-Attn在准确性和效率上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DySK-Attn为构建动态更新的语言模型提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a critical limitation: their
knowledge is static and quickly becomes outdated. Retraining these massive
models is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing
techniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address
this, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach
synergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated
instantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention
mechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,
efficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of
facts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of
dense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from
irrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on
time-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly
outperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated
knowledge and computational efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and
effective solution for building LLMs that can stay current with the
ever-changing world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在时间序列预测中的两个基本问题：时间模式的异质性和数值信号与语言表示的模态差异。

Method: 设计了一个异质性时间编码器和一个语义对齐模块，分别处理时间模式的异质性和模态差异。

Result: 在七个真实世界基准测试中，TALON表现优异，平均MSE提升达11%。

Conclusion: TALON通过模式感知和语义感知设计，有效适应LLM进行时间序列预测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in natural language processing due to their strong generalization
and sequence modeling capabilities. However, their direct application to time
series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the
inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between
continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this
work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting
by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment.
Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions
multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling
localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the
modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal
features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of
time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for
handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world
benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all
datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent
state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of
incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs
for time series forecasting. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLMs在社交媒体任务（如谣言检测）中表现不佳，原因包括预训练语料与社交文本不匹配、社交符号处理不足以及预训练任务未能有效建模传播结构中的用户互动。

Method: 提出PEP策略，通过预测帖子间的传播关系（根、分支、父级）来捕捉立场和情感的交互；发布TwitterCorpus和两个未标注的传播结构数据集；训练社交媒体定制的PLM（SoLM）。

Result: PEP显著提升了谣言检测性能，在基准数据集上提升基线模型1.0-3.7%准确率，甚至超越当前最优方法；SoLM单独表现也具竞争力。

Conclusion: PEP策略通过建模传播结构有效学习判别性帖子交互特征，显著提升PLMs在社交媒体任务中的表现。

Abstract: Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have excelled in various Natural Language
Processing tasks, benefiting from large-scale pretraining and self-attention
mechanism's ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, their
performance on social media application tasks like rumor detection remains
suboptimal. We attribute this to mismatches between pretraining corpora and
social texts, inadequate handling of unique social symbols, and pretraining
tasks ill-suited for modeling user engagements implicit in propagation
structures. To address these issues, we propose a continue pretraining strategy
called Post Engagement Prediction (PEP) to infuse information from propagation
structures into PLMs. PEP makes models to predict root, branch, and parent
relations between posts, capturing interactions of stance and sentiment crucial
for rumor detection. We also curate and release large-scale Twitter corpus:
TwitterCorpus (269GB text), and two unlabeled claim conversation datasets with
propagation structures (UTwitter and UWeibo). Utilizing these resources and PEP
strategy, we train a Twitter-tailored PLM called SoLM. Extensive experiments
demonstrate PEP significantly boosts rumor detection performance across
universal and social media PLMs, even in few-shot scenarios. On benchmark
datasets, PEP enhances baseline models by 1.0-3.7\% accuracy, even enabling it
to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets. SoLM
alone, without high-level modules, also achieves competitive results,
highlighting the strategy's effectiveness in learning discriminative post

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络在语音处理中的决策依据，通过CNN和LRP技术分析英语双音节词的重音预测，揭示了模型主要依赖重音音节的频谱特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络在语音处理中的决策依据，特别是如何解释其对英语双音节词重音位置的预测。

Method: 自动构建英语双音节词数据集，训练多个CNN架构预测重音位置，并使用LRP技术分析模型决策依据。

Result: 模型在测试数据上达到92%准确率，LRP显示预测主要依赖重音音节的频谱特性，尤其是第一和第二共振峰。

Conclusion: 深度学习能从自然数据中学习分布式的重音线索，扩展了传统语音学基于高度控制刺激的研究。

Abstract: Despite their success in speech processing, neural networks often operate as
black boxes, prompting the question: what informs their decisions, and how can
we interpret them? This work examines this issue in the context of lexical
stress. A dataset of English disyllabic words was automatically constructed
from read and spontaneous speech. Several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architectures were trained to predict stress position from a spectrographic
representation of disyllabic words lacking minimal stress pairs (e.g., initial
stress WAllet, final stress exTEND), achieving up to 92% accuracy on held-out
test data. Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique for CNN
interpretability analysis, revealed that predictions for held-out minimal pairs
(PROtest vs. proTEST ) were most strongly influenced by information in stressed
versus unstressed syllables, particularly the spectral properties of stressed
vowels. However, the classifiers also attended to information throughout the
word. A feature-specific relevance analysis is proposed, and its results
suggest that our best-performing classifier is strongly influenced by the
stressed vowel's first and second formants, with some evidence that its pitch
and third formant also contribute. These results reveal deep learning's ability
to acquire distributed cues to stress from naturally occurring data, extending
traditional phonetic work based around highly controlled stimuli.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于提示调优和记忆演示模板的方法，解决了少样本持续学习命名实体识别任务中的Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在少样本持续学习命名实体识别任务中，新类别实体稀缺导致模型泛化能力差，且旧类别信息缺失阻碍知识蒸馏，引发Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma。

Method: 设计了可扩展的Anchor words导向提示调优（APT）范式，并引入记忆演示模板（MDT）提供历史任务样本。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在FS-CLNER任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过提示调优和记忆演示模板策略，有效解决了少样本持续学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has been successfully applied to Continual Learning
Named Entity Recognition (CLNER) tasks, by using a teacher model trained on
old-class data to distill old-class entities present in new-class data as a
form of regularization, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting. However, in
Few-Shot CLNER (FS-CLNER) tasks, the scarcity of new-class entities makes it
difficult for the trained model to generalize during inference. More
critically, the lack of old-class entity information hinders the distillation
of old knowledge, causing the model to fall into what we refer to as the
Few-Shot Distillation Dilemma. In this work, we address the above challenges
through a prompt tuning paradigm and memory demonstration template strategy.
Specifically, we designed an expandable Anchor words-oriented Prompt Tuning
(APT) paradigm to bridge the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, thereby
enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we incorporated
Memory Demonstration Templates (MDT) into each training instance to provide
replay samples from previous tasks, which not only avoids the Few-Shot
Distillation Dilemma but also promotes in-context learning. Experiments show
that our approach achieves competitive performances on FS-CLNER.

TL;DR: 扩展二维动态发音模型DYNARTmo，集成三维腭穹内部表示，通过矢状舌轮廓估计舌-腭接触区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进发音模型以更准确地模拟舌-腭接触，支持语音科学教育和治疗。

Method: 实现两种腭穹几何模型（半椭圆和余弦曲线），在冠状面计算侧向接触点，生成类似电子腭动图的2D+可视化。

Result: 模型支持三视图同步显示（矢状、声门和腭视图），适用于静态和动态发音展示。

Conclusion: 未来工作将增加面部视图并实现发音-声学合成，以定量评估模型真实性。

Abstract: This paper describes an extension of the two-dimensional dynamic articulatory
model DYNARTmo by integrating an internal three-dimensional representation of
the palatal dome to estimate tongue-palate contact areas from midsagittal
tongue contours. Two alternative dome geometries - a half-ellipse and a cosine
based profile - are implemented to model lateral curvature in the coronal
plane. Using these geometries, lateral contact points are analytically computed
for each anterior-posterior position, enabling the generation of
electropalatography-like visualizations within the 2D+ framework. The enhanced
model supports three synchronized views (sagittal, glottal, and palatal) for
static and dynamic (animated) articulation displays, suitable for speech
science education and speech therapy. Future work includes adding a facial
(lip) view and implementing articulatory-to-acoustic synthesis to
quantitatively evaluate model realism.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种方法（显式和隐式）将上下文副语言信息融入语音大语言模型训练，提升共情推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型在共情推理方面表现不足，主要因缺乏结合上下文内容和副语言线索的训练数据。

Method: 1. 显式方法：直接提供副语言元数据（如情感标注）给模型；2. 隐式方法：自动生成结合情感标注和语音转录的新训练问答对。

Result: 隐式方法在人工标注问答基准上提升38.41%，结合显式方法后达46.02%，验证了上下文副语言理解的有效性。

Conclusion: 两种方法结合显著提升模型性能，LLM评判指标与分类指标相关性验证了其可靠性。

Abstract: Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations
in empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that
integrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we
propose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information
into model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic
metadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit
method that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs
using both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech
transcriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%
on a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the
explicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic
understanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation
with classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.

TL;DR: MAQuA是一种自适应提问框架，用于多维心理健康筛查，通过优化问题选择减少提问数量，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行心理健康评估时，频繁提问会增加用户负担且效率低下，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合多结果建模、项目反应理论（IRT）和因子分析，动态选择最具信息量的问题。

Result: MAQuA将问题数量减少50-87%，在抑郁和饮食障碍等领域表现稳健。

Conclusion: MAQuA是一种高效工具，可推动LLM在临床工作中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for
scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs
burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across
transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive
question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health
screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item
response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with
most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize
diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response
burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the
number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87%
compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71%
fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA
demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety)
and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping
strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position
MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive
mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into
real-world clinical workflows.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在伦理敏感决策中的作用增加，理解其道德推理过程变得至关重要。

Method: 通过因子提示协议，收集了3,780个二元决策和自然语言解释，分析了决策果断性、解释一致性、公众道德对齐等维度。

Result: 推理增强模型表现更果断且解释更结构化，但未必更符合人类共识；在利他主义、公平和美德伦理框架下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 建议将道德推理作为模型对齐的主要维度，并建立标准化基准评估决策背后的原因。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate ethically sensitive
decisions, understanding their moral reasoning processes becomes imperative.
This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 14 leading LLMs,
both reasoning enabled and general purpose, across 27 diverse trolley problem
scenarios, framed by ten moral philosophies, including utilitarianism,
deontology, and altruism. Using a factorial prompting protocol, we elicited
3,780 binary decisions and natural language justifications, enabling analysis
along axes of decisional assertiveness, explanation answer consistency, public
moral alignment, and sensitivity to ethically irrelevant cues. Our findings
reveal significant variability across ethical frames and model types: reasoning
enhanced models demonstrate greater decisiveness and structured justifications,
yet do not always align better with human consensus. Notably, "sweet zones"
emerge in altruistic, fairness, and virtue ethics framings, where models
achieve a balance of high intervention rates, low explanation conflict, and
minimal divergence from aggregated human judgments. However, models diverge
under frames emphasizing kinship, legality, or self interest, often producing
ethically controversial outcomes. These patterns suggest that moral prompting
is not only a behavioral modifier but also a diagnostic tool for uncovering
latent alignment philosophies across providers. We advocate for moral reasoning
to become a primary axis in LLM alignment, calling for standardized benchmarks
that evaluate not just what LLMs decide, but how and why.

TL;DR: ARCE提出了一种通过LLM生成简单解释（Cote）来增强RoBERTa模型的方法，显著提升了AEC领域NER任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AEC领域NER任务中预训练模型因领域术语和复杂关系导致的性能限制，避免高成本的人工标注。

Method: 利用LLM生成简单解释（Cote），并用其增量预训练RoBERTa模型，再进行下游任务微调。

Result: 在AEC基准数据集上达到77.20%的Macro-F1分数，优于复杂角色推理。

Conclusion: 简单解释知识比复杂推理更有效，ARCE为领域特定任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical
challenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,
engineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking
(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by
the domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and
complex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be
mitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as
exemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and
cost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,
the optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance
smaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose
ARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach
that systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE
employs an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which
we term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa
model prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive
experiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark
AEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a
key finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more
effective than complex, role-based rationales for this task. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语文本或视觉模态，缺乏对多语言语音输入的事实性评估，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了包含8种语言的并行语音-文本事实问题集（CCFQA），并提出了一种少样本迁移学习策略，将英语问答能力迁移到多语言语音问答任务。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在CCFQA上表现不佳，但提出的迁移学习策略仅用5次训练即可达到与GPT-4o-mini-Audio竞争的性能。

Conclusion: CCFQA为开发更可靠的多语言语音理解MLLMs提供了基础资源，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the
multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly
crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or
visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in
evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge
this gap, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ross-lingual and \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{F}actuality benchmark (\textbf{CCFQA}). Specifically, the CCFQA
benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages,
designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal
factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current
MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we
propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the
Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken
Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with
GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a
foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more
robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有研究未测试LLMs在面对模糊化问题时的表现，因此需要系统评估其局限性。

Method: 提出ObfusQAte技术和ObfusQA框架，通过三个维度（命名实体间接、干扰项间接、上下文过载）评估LLMs。

Result: LLMs在复杂语言变化下表现不佳，容易失败或产生幻觉回答。

Conclusion: ObfusQA为评估LLMs鲁棒性提供了全面基准，并公开了ObfusQAte以促进相关研究。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
contributed to the development of equitable AI systems capable of factual
question-answering (QA). However, no known study tests the LLMs' robustness
when presented with obfuscated versions of questions. To systematically
evaluate these limitations, we propose a novel technique, ObfusQAte and,
leveraging the same, introduce ObfusQA, a comprehensive, first of its kind,
framework with multi-tiered obfuscation levels designed to examine LLM
capabilities across three distinct dimensions: (i) Named-Entity Indirection,
(ii) Distractor Indirection, and (iii) Contextual Overload. By capturing these
fine-grained distinctions in language, ObfusQA provides a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating LLM robustness and adaptability. Our study observes
that LLMs exhibit a tendency to fail or generate hallucinated responses when
confronted with these increasingly nuanced variations. To foster research in
this direction, we make ObfusQAte publicly available.

Conclusion: 研究展示了多语言技术的潜力，但也指出了技术不成熟可能带来的负面影响。

Abstract: Most people are multilingual, and most multilinguals code-switch, yet the
characteristics of code-switched language are not fully understood. We
developed a chatbot capable of completing a Map Task with human participants
using code-switched Spanish and English. In two experiments, we prompted the
bot to code-switch according to different strategies, examining (1) the
feasibility of such experiments for investigating bilingual language use, and
(2) whether participants would be sensitive to variations in discourse and
grammatical patterns. Participants generally enjoyed code-switching with our
bot as long as it produced predictable code-switching behavior; when
code-switching was random or ungrammatical (as when producing unattested
incongruent mixed-language noun phrases, such as `la fork'), participants
enjoyed the task less and were less successful at completing it. These results
underscore the potential downsides of deploying insufficiently developed
multilingual language technology, while also illustrating the promise of such
technology for conducting research on bilingual language use.

Conclusion: TurnGuide有效解决了FD-SLMs的挑战，提升了语音交互的自然性和语义连贯性。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation
models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling
complex conversational dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and
overlapping speech, and End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world
double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue
patterns for human-like interactions. However, they face a critical challenge
-- their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text
conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken
dialogue data. While text-guided speech generation could mitigate these issues,
it suffers from timing and length issues when integrating textual guidance into
double-channel audio streams, disrupting the precise time alignment essential
for natural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose TurnGuide, a
novel planning-inspired approach that mimics human conversational planning by
dynamically segmenting assistant speech into dialogue turns and generating
turn-level text guidance before speech output, which effectively resolves both
insertion timing and length challenges. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
approach significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs' conversational abilities, enabling
them to generate semantically meaningful and coherent speech while maintaining
natural conversational flow. Demos are available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在高资源环境中表现优异，但在低资源语言和文化长尾实体上表现不佳。为了解决这一问题，论文旨在通过文化知识增强模型能力。

Method: 利用Wikidata知识图谱收集文化相关图像，生成多语言视觉问答数据，构建包含2200万对高质量文化相关VQA数据的数据集CulturalGround，并训练开源模型CulturalPangea。

Result: CulturalPangea在文化聚焦的多语言多模态基准测试中表现最优，平均优于先前模型5.0分，同时不影响主流视觉语言任务的表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对文化知识的增强方法能显著缩小多模态大语言模型的文化差距，为全球包容性多模态系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models excel in high-resource settings, but often
misinterpret long-tail cultural entities and underperform in low-resource
languages. To address this gap, we propose a data-centric approach that
directly grounds MLLMs in cultural knowledge. Leveraging a large scale
knowledge graph from Wikidata, we collect images that represent culturally
significant entities, and generate synthetic multilingual visual question
answering data. The resulting dataset, CulturalGround, comprises 22 million
high-quality, culturally-rich VQA pairs spanning 42 countries and 39 languages.
We train an open-source MLLM CulturalPangea on CulturalGround, interleaving
standard multilingual instruction-tuning data to preserve general abilities.
CulturalPangea achieves state-of-the-art performance among open models on
various culture-focused multilingual multimodal benchmarks, outperforming prior
models by an average of 5.0 without degrading results on mainstream
vision-language tasks. Our findings show that our targeted, culturally grounded
approach could substantially narrow the cultural gap in MLLMs and offer a
practical path towards globally inclusive multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成方法在效率和可扩展性上存在不足，树搜索方法树规模增长快，改进方法则面临奖励信号不明确和搜索策略低效的问题。

Method: ReLoc通过初始代码起草、邻域代码生成、候选评估和代码更新四个关键组件实现局部搜索，并开发了专门的修订奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，ReLoc在多样代码生成任务中表现优异，显著优于树搜索和改进方法。

Conclusion: ReLoc为代码生成提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with inference-time scaling techniques show
promise for code generation, yet face notable efficiency and scalability
challenges. Construction-based tree-search methods suffer from rapid growth in
tree size, high token consumption, and lack of anytime property. In contrast,
improvement-based methods offer better performance but often struggle with
uninformative reward signals and inefficient search strategies. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ReLoc}, a unified local search framework which effectively
performs step-by-step code revision. Specifically, ReLoc explores a series of
local revisions through four key algorithmic components: initial code drafting,
neighborhood code generation, candidate evaluation, and incumbent code
updating, each of which can be instantiated with specific decision rules to
realize different local search algorithms such as Hill Climbing (HC) or Genetic
Algorithm (GA). Furthermore, we develop a specialized revision reward model
that evaluates code quality based on revision distance to produce fine-grained
preferences that guide the local search toward more promising candidates.
Finally, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks,
significantly outperforming both construction-based tree search as well as the
state-of-the-art improvement-based code generation methods.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）在处理长输入时存在位置偏差，如“迷失在中间”（LiM）效应，但该效应在输入长度超过模型上下文窗口50%时减弱，转而表现为基于距离的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在长输入中的位置偏差（如LiM效应）的强度和表现条件，以改进长上下文任务和评估方法。

Method: 通过相对输入长度（相对于模型上下文窗口）进行综合分析，研究位置偏差的变化。

Result: LiM效应在输入长度占上下文窗口50%以下时最强；超过后，首因偏差减弱，近因偏差稳定，表现为基于距离的偏差。

Conclusion: 位置偏差主要源于检索过程，对长上下文任务、LLM基准设计和评估方法有重要影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to use information across long
inputs effectively. Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the
Lost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information
appears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,
rather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently
replicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the
conditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,
defined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that
the LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context
window. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains
relatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we
observe a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant
information is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest
that successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the
observed positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.
These insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future
LLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.

TL;DR: ALOPE框架通过层优化和动态加权提升LLM在机器翻译质量评估中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在质量评估任务中表现不足，尤其是对低资源语言。

Method: ALOPE结合低秩适配器和回归任务头，动态加权多层表示，并采用多头回归策略。

Result: ALOPE优于现有LLM方法，中间层表示更符合跨语言任务需求。

Conclusion: ALOPE为LLM在质量评估任务中提供了有效优化，并公开了模型和代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine
Translation (MT), which assesses the quality of a source-target pair without
relying on reference translations, remains a challenging cross-lingual task for
LLMs. The challenges stem from the inherent limitations of existing LLM-based
QE systems, which are pre-trained for causal language modelling rather than
regression-specific tasks, further elevated by the presence of low-resource
languages given pre-training data distribution. This paper introduces ALOPE, an
adaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by
restructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for
improved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank
adapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained
Transformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the
layer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,
which adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head
regression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our
framework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.
Empirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs
provide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual
nature of the QE task. We make resultant models and framework code publicly
available for further research, also allowing existing LLM-based MT frameworks
to be scaled with QE capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑数据分析的方法，用于识别GPT-2中导致对特定群体偏见的注意力头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能明确语言模型中哪些部分对特定群体的偏见负责。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析识别GPT-2中导致偏见的注意力头。

Result: 发现偏见集中在特定注意力头中，且该方法可识别特定群体偏见的来源。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于未来去偏见化语言模型。

Abstract: Recently, many bias detection methods have been proposed to determine the
level of bias a large language model captures. However, tests to identify which
parts of a large language model are responsible for bias towards specific
groups remain underdeveloped. In this study, we present a method using
topological data analysis to identify which heads in GPT-2 contribute to the
misrepresentation of identity groups present in the StereoSet dataset. We find
that biases for particular categories, such as gender or profession, are
concentrated in attention heads that act as hot spots. The metric we propose
can also be used to determine which heads capture bias for a specific group
within a bias category, and future work could extend this method to help
de-bias large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThemeClouds是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的开源可视化工具，用于从对话转录中生成主题词云，解决了传统频率词云在对话场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统频率词云在对话中效果不佳，无法捕捉语义相关的内容或忽略同义词，限制了其在早期研究分析中的实用性。

Method: ThemeClouds利用LLM识别语料库中的概念级主题，并统计提及每个主题的独立参与者数量，生成基于提及广度的词云。

Result: 与频率词云和主题建模基线（如LDA、BERTopic）相比，ThemeClouds能更有效地提取用户研究中设备相关的问题。

Conclusion: ThemeClouds为定性工作流提供了透明可控的LLM辅助工具，同时探讨了交互式分析（如差异词云）的潜力。

Abstract: Word clouds are a common way to summarize qualitative interviews, yet
traditional frequency-based methods often fail in conversational contexts: they
surface filler words, ignore paraphrase, and fragment semantically related
ideas. This limits their usefulness in early-stage analysis, when researchers
need fast, interpretable overviews of what participant actually said. We
introduce ThemeClouds, an open-source visualization tool that uses large
language models (LLMs) to generate thematic, participant-weighted word clouds
from dialogue transcripts. The system prompts an LLM to identify concept-level
themes across a corpus and then counts how many unique participants mention
each topic, yielding a visualization grounded in breadth of mention rather than
raw term frequency. Researchers can customize prompts and visualization
parameters, providing transparency and control. Using interviews from a user
study comparing five recording-device configurations (31 participants; 155
transcripts, Whisper ASR), our approach surfaces more actionable device
concerns than frequency clouds and topic-modeling baselines (e.g., LDA,
BERTopic). We discuss design trade-offs for integrating LLM assistance into
qualitative workflows, implications for interpretability and researcher agency,
and opportunities for interactive analyses such as per-condition contrasts
(``diff clouds'').

Motivation: 传统RL方法依赖规则反馈指导LLMs生成复杂推理链，但探索行为的机制尚不明确，需深入研究。

Method: 研究探索空间塑造、熵-性能交换及RL性能优化，结合定量指标和新实证证据。

Result: 提出了量化LLMs能力边界的指标，分析了探索与性能的关系，并优化了RL性能。

Conclusion: 为RLVR系统的进一步发展提供了理论基础和实证支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RL approaches, RLVR leverages rule-based
feedback to guide LLMs in generating and refining complex reasoning chains -- a
process critically dependent on effective exploration strategies. While prior
work has demonstrated RLVR's empirical success, the fundamental mechanisms
governing LLMs' exploration behaviors remain underexplored. This technical
report presents a systematic investigation of exploration capacities in RLVR,
covering four main aspects: (1) exploration space shaping, where we develop
quantitative metrics to characterize LLMs' capability boundaries; (2)
entropy-performance exchange, analyzed across training stages, individual
instances, and token-level patterns; and (3) RL performance optimization,
examining methods to effectively translate exploration gains into measurable
improvements. By unifying previously identified insights with new empirical
evidence, this work aims to provide a foundational framework for advancing RLVR
systems.

TL;DR: IBPS是一个AI驱动的保释预测系统，旨在通过预测结果和生成法律依据来辅助印度法院的保释决策，减少主观性和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度法院的保释决策存在主观性、延迟和不一致问题，且监狱中75%为未审判囚犯，加剧人权问题和司法积压。

Method: 基于15万份高等法院保释判决数据集，利用参数高效技术微调大语言模型，结合法律条文和RAG技术。

Result: 结合法律知识的模型显著优于基线，表现出高准确性和解释质量，并能泛化到专家标注的测试集。

Conclusion: IBPS为印度司法系统提供了透明、可扩展的解决方案，支持数据驱动的法律辅助，促进程序公平。

Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian
courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies.
With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners,
many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and
fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to
systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction
System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail
decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales
based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and
release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched
with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime
category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a
large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its
performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context,
and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory
knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and
explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated
by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible
solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and
promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.

TL;DR: KeyCP++是一种基于关键词的链式思维提示方法，解决了LLM在事件检测中的过解释问题，通过自动标注逻辑间隙和触发词分析提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在事件检测中因对触发词理解不准确和过解释问题表现不佳，传统ICL方法无法有效纠正。

Method: 提出KeyCP++，通过构建触发词判别提示模板，结合关键词作为锚点，生成候选触发词并验证其合理性。

Result: 实验证明KeyCP++在单样本事件检测中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: KeyCP++通过改进提示设计和逻辑分析，有效提升了LLM在事件检测中的表现。

Abstract: Although the LLM-based in-context learning (ICL) paradigm has demonstrated
considerable success across various natural language processing tasks, it
encounters challenges in event detection. This is because LLMs lack an accurate
understanding of event triggers and tend to make over-interpretation, which
cannot be effectively corrected through in-context examples alone. In this
paper, we focus on the most challenging one-shot setting and propose KeyCP++, a
keyword-centric chain-of-thought prompting approach. KeyCP++ addresses the
weaknesses of conventional ICL by automatically annotating the logical gaps
between input text and detection results for the demonstrations. Specifically,
to generate in-depth and meaningful rationale, KeyCP++ constructs a trigger
discrimination prompting template. It incorporates the exemplary triggers
(a.k.a keywords) into the prompt as the anchor to simply trigger profiling, let
LLM propose candidate triggers, and justify each candidate. These
propose-and-judge rationales help LLMs mitigate over-reliance on the keywords
and promote detection rule learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant advancements in one-shot
event detection.

TL;DR: InterChart是一个评估视觉语言模型在多图表推理能力的诊断基准，分为三个难度层级，揭示了模型在复杂图表集成中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单一图表，而实际应用中需要跨多个相关图表进行推理，因此需要InterChart来填补这一空白。

Method: InterChart包含三类难度递增的任务：单图表事实推理、合成对齐图表集的综合分析以及真实复杂图表对的语义推理。

Result: 评估显示，随着图表复杂度增加，模型准确性显著下降，但将复杂图表分解为简单单元可提升性能。

Conclusion: InterChart为复杂多视觉环境中的多模态推理提供了严格框架，揭示了模型在跨图表集成中的系统性不足。

Abstract: We introduce InterChart, a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates how well
vision-language models (VLMs) reason across multiple related charts, a task
central to real-world applications such as scientific reporting, financial
analysis, and public policy dashboards. Unlike prior benchmarks focusing on
isolated, visually uniform charts, InterChart challenges models with diverse
question types ranging from entity inference and trend correlation to numerical
estimation and abstract multi-step reasoning grounded in 2-3 thematically or
structurally related charts. We organize the benchmark into three tiers of
increasing difficulty: (1) factual reasoning over individual charts, (2)
integrative analysis across synthetically aligned chart sets, and (3) semantic
inference over visually complex, real-world chart pairs. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs reveals consistent and steep
accuracy declines as chart complexity increases. We find that models perform
better when we decompose multi-entity charts into simpler visual units,
underscoring their struggles with cross-chart integration. By exposing these
systematic limitations, InterChart provides a rigorous framework for advancing
multimodal reasoning in complex, multi-visual environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoSemB的逻辑引导语义桥接框架，用于解决大语言模型在工具学习中遇到的未见工具检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中工具库不断更新，现有方法假设所有工具在训练时已知，无法处理未见工具，导致分布偏移和相似性检索脆弱性问题。

Method: LoSemB框架包含逻辑嵌入对齐模块和关系增强检索机制，旨在挖掘和转移潜在逻辑信息，无需昂贵重新训练。

Result: 实验表明，LoSemB在归纳设置中表现优异，同时在转导设置中保持良好效果。

Conclusion: LoSemB通过逻辑引导和语义桥接，有效解决了未见工具检索的挑战，为工具学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for large language models
(LLMs) to solve many real-world tasks. Nonetheless, with the tool repository
rapidly expanding, it is impractical to contain all tools within the limited
input length of LLMs. To alleviate these issues, researchers have explored
incorporating a tool retrieval module to select the most relevant tools or
represent tools as unique tokens within LLM parameters. However, most
state-of-the-art methods are under transductive settings, assuming all tools
have been observed during training. Such a setting deviates from reality as the
real-world tool repository is evolving and incorporates new tools frequently.
When dealing with these unseen tools, which refer to tools not encountered
during the training phase, these methods are limited by two key issues,
including the large distribution shift and the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. To this end, inspired by human cognitive processes
of mastering unseen tools through discovering and applying the logical
information from prior experience, we introduce a novel Logic-Guided Semantic
Bridging framework for inductive tool retrieval, namely, LoSemB, which aims to
mine and transfer latent logical information for inductive tool retrieval
without costly retraining. Specifically, LoSemB contains a logic-based
embedding alignment module to mitigate distribution shifts and implements a
relational augmented retrieval mechanism to reduce the vulnerability of
similarity-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoSemB
achieves advanced performance in inductive settings while maintaining desirable
effectiveness in the transductive setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的模型在预测长上下文（如完整句子）时的局限性，并提出了一种新的评估方法（MSP）来测试模型在填充被随机移除句子时的表现。研究发现，商业LLMs在低结构化领域中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索NTP（Next Token Prediction）在长上下文预测中的局限性，尤其是模型在全局连贯性方面的不足。

Method: 方法包括评估三种商业LLM（GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash）在三种领域（叙事、程序性和说明性）中的MSP任务表现，关注保真度和连贯性。

Result: 关键发现是商业LLMs在低结构化领域中预测被遮蔽句子时表现较差。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前模型在长上下文预测和全局连贯性方面存在能力缺口。

Abstract: Transformer-based models primarily rely on Next Token Prediction (NTP), which
predicts the next token in a sequence based on the preceding context. However,
NTP's focus on single-token prediction often limits a model's ability to plan
ahead or maintain long-range coherence, raising questions about how well LLMs
can predict longer contexts, such as full sentences within structured
documents. While NTP encourages local fluency, it provides no explicit
incentive to ensure global coherence across sentence boundaries-an essential
skill for reconstructive or discursive tasks. To investigate this, we evaluate
three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) on
Masked Sentence Prediction (MSP) - the task of infilling a randomly removed
sentence - from three domains: ROCStories (narrative), Recipe1M (procedural),
and Wikipedia (expository). We assess both fidelity (similarity to the original
sentence) and cohesiveness (fit within the surrounding context). Our key
finding reveals that commercial LLMs, despite their superlative performance in
other tasks, are poor at predicting masked sentences in low-structured domains,
highlighting a gap in current model capabilities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多种任务中表现优异，但其输出可能与输入不一致（忠实性幻觉），社会偏见是否导致这一现象尚未被研究。

Method: 采用结构因果模型（SCM）验证偏见与幻觉的因果关系，设计偏见干预措施，并开发偏见干预数据集（BID）进行精确测量。

Result: 实验发现偏见是导致忠实性幻觉的重要因素，且不同偏见状态的影响方向各异。偏见对不公平幻觉的因果效应尤为显著。

Conclusion: 社会偏见对大型语言模型的忠实性幻觉具有显著且微妙的因果影响，需进一步研究以优化模型表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the
output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether
social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has
not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the
context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and
hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to
control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset
(BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of
causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are
significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias
state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal
effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness
hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the
subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.

Conclusion: 语法分块策略和SASST框架有效优化了同步语音翻译的语义连贯性和翻译质量。

Abstract: This work proposes a grammar-based chunking strategy that segments input
streams into semantically complete units by parsing dependency relations (e.g.,
noun phrase boundaries, verb-object structures) and punctuation features. The
method ensures chunk coherence and minimizes semantic fragmentation. Building
on this mechanism, we present SASST (Syntax-Aware Simultaneous Speech
Translation), an end-to-end framework integrating frozen Whisper encoder and
decoder-only LLM. The unified architecture dynamically outputs translation
tokens or <WAIT> symbols to jointly optimize translation timing and content,
with target-side reordering addressing word-order divergence. Experiments on

quality improvements across languages and validate the effectiveness of

Conclusion: Grove MoE通过异构专家和动态激活机制，有效提升了模型的计算效率和性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is a cornerstone of modern
state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). MoE models facilitate
scalability by enabling sparse parameter activation. However, traditional MoE
architecture uses homogeneous experts of a uniform size, activating a fixed
number of parameters irrespective of input complexity and thus limiting
computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Grove MoE,
a novel architecture incorporating experts of varying sizes, inspired by the
heterogeneous big.LITTLE CPU architecture. This architecture features novel
adjugate experts with a dynamic activation mechanism, enabling model capacity
expansion while maintaining manageable computational overhead. Building on this
architecture, we present GroveMoE-Base and GroveMoE-Inst, 33B-parameter LLMs
developed by applying an upcycling strategy to the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base model
during mid-training and post-training. GroveMoE models dynamically activate
3.14-3.28B parameters based on token complexity and achieve performance
comparable to SOTA open-source models of similar or even larger size.

Motivation: 探讨LLM评委是否容易被说服性语言操纵，尤其是在数学推理任务中，正确性本应与风格无关。

Method: 基于亚里士多德的修辞原则，定义了七种说服技巧，并将其嵌入到相同的数学答案中，测试LLM评委的评分偏差。

Result: 说服性语言导致LLM评委对错误答案的评分平均虚高8%，其中“一致性”技巧影响最大。模型规模增大无法显著缓解此问题。

Conclusion: LLM评委易受说服性语言影响，需开发更鲁棒的防御机制以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: As large language models take on growing roles as automated evaluators in
practical settings, a critical question arises: Can individuals persuade an LLM
judge to assign unfairly high scores? This study is the first to reveal that
strategically embedded persuasive language can bias LLM judges when scoring
mathematical reasoning tasks, where correctness should be independent of
stylistic variation. Grounded in Aristotle's rhetorical principles, we
formalize seven persuasion techniques (Majority, Consistency, Flattery,
Reciprocity, Pity, Authority, Identity) and embed them into otherwise identical
responses. Across six math benchmarks, we find that persuasive language leads
LLM judges to assign inflated scores to incorrect solutions, by up to 8% on
average, with Consistency causing the most severe distortion. Notably,
increasing model size does not substantially mitigate this vulnerability.
Further analysis demonstrates that combining multiple persuasion techniques
amplifies the bias, and pairwise evaluation is likewise susceptible. Moreover,
the persuasive effect persists under counter prompting strategies, highlighting
a critical vulnerability in LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines and underscoring the need
for robust defenses against persuasion-based attacks.

Motivation: 填补语言学中焦点分析（FA）定量研究的空白，并探索组合方法在SA和FA中的通用性。

Method: 利用通用依赖（UDs）形式化的基本句法规则（如修饰、协调和否定）进行组合分析，并与非组合方法VADER对比。

Result: 组合方法在SA中表现出更高的可解释性和准确性，且结果可推广到FA。

Conclusion: 组合方法在SA和FA中均有效，为语言学分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper summarizes the results of evaluating a compositional approach for
Focus Analysis (FA) in Linguistics and Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While quantitative evaluations of compositional and
non-compositional approaches in SA exist in NLP, similar quantitative
evaluations are very rare in FA in Linguistics that deal with linguistic
expressions representing focus or emphasis such as "it was John who left". We
fill this gap in research by arguing that compositional rules in SA also apply
to FA because FA and SA are closely related meaning that SA is part of FA. Our
compositional approach in SA exploits basic syntactic rules such as rules of
modification, coordination, and negation represented in the formalism of
Universal Dependencies (UDs) in English and applied to words representing
sentiments from sentiment dictionaries. Some of the advantages of our
compositional analysis method for SA in contrast to non-compositional analysis
methods are interpretability and explainability. We test the accuracy of our
compositional approach and compare it with a non-compositional approach VADER
that uses simple heuristic rules to deal with negation, coordination and
modification. In contrast to previous related work that evaluates
compositionality in SA on long reviews, this study uses more appropriate
datasets to evaluate compositionality. In addition, we generalize the results
of compositional approaches in SA to compositional approaches in FA.

Abstract: Textual data annotation, the process of labeling or tagging text with
relevant information, is typically costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential as direct
alternatives to human annotators for general domains natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on annotation tasks in domains
requiring expert knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate: whether top-performing LLMs, which might be perceived as having
expert-level proficiency in academic and professional benchmarks, can serve as
direct alternatives to human expert annotators? To this end, we evaluate both
individual LLMs and multi-agent approaches across three highly specialized
domains: finance, biomedicine, and law. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
discussion framework to simulate a group of human annotators, where LLMs are
tasked to engage in discussions by considering others' annotations and
justifications before finalizing their labels. Additionally, we incorporate
reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) to enable a more comprehensive comparison. Our
empirical results reveal that: (1) Individual LLMs equipped with inference-time
techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought (CoT), self-consistency) show only marginal
or even negative performance gains, contrary to prior literature suggesting
their broad effectiveness. (2) Overall, reasoning models do not demonstrate
statistically significant improvements over non-reasoning models in most
settings. This suggests that extended long CoT provides relatively limited
benefits for data annotation in specialized domains. (3) Certain model
behaviors emerge in the multi-agent discussion environment. For instance,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking rarely changes its initial annotations, even
when other agents provide correct annotations or valid reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补法律NLP领域中对合同分类任务全面评估的空白。

Method: 比较10个法律专用LLM和7个通用LLM在三个英语合同理解任务上的表现。

Result: 法律专用LLM表现优于通用模型，Legal-BERT和Contracts-BERT在两个任务上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: 结果为法律专用LLM提供了全面评估，有助于开发更准确的合同理解系统。

Abstract: Despite advances in legal NLP, no comprehensive evaluation covering multiple
legal-specific LLMs currently exists for contract classification tasks in
contract understanding. To address this gap, we present an evaluation of 10
legal-specific LLMs on three English language contract understanding tasks and
compare them with 7 general-purpose LLMs. The results show that legal-specific
LLMs consistently outperform general-purpose models, especially on tasks
requiring nuanced legal understanding. Legal-BERT and Contracts-BERT establish
new SOTAs on two of the three tasks, despite having 69% fewer parameters than
the best-performing general-purpose LLM. We also identify CaseLaw-BERT and
LexLM as strong additional baselines for contract understanding. Our results
provide a holistic evaluation of legal-specific LLMs and will facilitate the
development of more accurate contract understanding systems.

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task that aims to identify sentiment toward specific aspects of an entity.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capabilities for Czech ABSA
remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation
of 19 LLMs of varying sizes and architectures on Czech ABSA, comparing their
performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. Our results show
that small domain-specific models fine-tuned for ABSA outperform
general-purpose LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while fine-tuned LLMs
achieve state-of-the-art results. We analyze how factors such as
multilingualism, model size, and recency influence performance and present an
error analysis highlighting key challenges, particularly in aspect term
prediction. Our findings provide insights into the suitability of LLMs for
Czech ABSA and offer guidance for future research in this area.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在低资源语言中，通过少量目标语言示例提升跨语言方面情感分析（ABSA）性能的效果。实验表明，仅添加10个目标语言示例即可显著优于零样本设置，且结合1000个示例甚至能超越单语基线。


<details>

Motivation: 解决低资源语言中ABSA任务因标注数据稀缺而面临的挑战，探索少量目标语言示例对性能的提升潜力。

Method: 在四种ABSA任务、六种目标语言和两种序列到序列模型上，评估添加少量目标语言示例对训练集的影响。

Result: 添加10个目标语言示例显著提升性能；结合1000个示例可超越单语基线。

Conclusion: 少量高质量目标语言示例是提升跨语言ABSA的可行且高效方法，适用于低资源和领域特定场景。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has received substantial attention in
English, yet challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the scarcity
of labelled data. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches often rely on external
translation tools and overlook the potential benefits of incorporating a small
number of target language examples into training. In this paper, we evaluate
the effect of adding few-shot target language examples to the training set
across four ABSA tasks, six target languages, and two sequence-to-sequence
models. We show that adding as few as ten target language examples
significantly improves performance over zero-shot settings and achieves a
similar effect to constrained decoding in reducing prediction errors.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining 1,000 target language examples with
English data can even surpass monolingual baselines. These findings offer
practical insights for improving cross-lingual ABSA in low-resource and
domain-specific settings, as obtaining ten high-quality annotated examples is
both feasible and highly effective.

Motivation: 研究动机是填补LLMs在提供文化敏感情感支持方面的研究空白，并开发相关资源。

Method: 方法包括构建CultureCare数据集（涵盖四种文化），开发四种适应策略，并通过LLM评估、人类注释和临床心理学家评估进行综合测试。

Result: 结果表明，调整后的LLMs表现优于匿名在线同伴回复，且文化角色扮演不足以实现文化敏感性。LLMs在临床培训中显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs在提供文化敏感情感支持方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究和优化适应策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in offering emotional support and
generating empathetic responses for individuals in distress, but their ability
to deliver culturally sensitive support remains underexplored due to lack of
resources. In this work, we introduce CultureCare, the first dataset designed
for this task, spanning four cultures and including 1729 distress messages,
1523 cultural signals, and 1041 support strategies with fine-grained emotional
and cultural annotations. Leveraging CultureCare, we (i) develop and test four
adaptation strategies for guiding three state-of-the-art LLMs toward culturally
sensitive responses; (ii) conduct comprehensive evaluations using LLM judges,
in-culture human annotators, and clinical psychologists; (iii) show that
adapted LLMs outperform anonymous online peer responses, and that simple
cultural role-play is insufficient for cultural sensitivity; and (iv) explore
the application of LLMs in clinical training, where experts highlight their
potential in fostering cultural competence in future therapists.

Conclusion: 两参数表示法为手语虚拟角色的情感表达提供了更直观和标准化的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-manual signals in sign languages continue to be a challenge for signing
avatars. More specifically, emotional content has been difficult to incorporate
because of a lack of a standard method of specifying the avatar's emotional
state. This paper explores the application of an intuitive two-parameter
representation for emotive non-manual signals to the Paula signing avatar that
shows promise for facilitating the linguistic specification of emotional facial
expressions in a more coherent manner than previous methods. Users can apply
these parameters to control Paula's emotional expressions through a textual
representation called the EASIER notation. The representation can allow avatars
to express more nuanced emotional states using two numerical parameters. It
also has the potential to enable more consistent specification of emotional
non-manual signals in linguistic annotations which drive signing avatars.

Motivation: 科学写作质量评估需要领域知识和专家偏好，现有自动指标和LLM评估系统不足。

Method: 提出GREP框架，分解评估为多维度，结合专家偏好和对比示例。

Result: GREP评估更稳健，与专家评估强相关，现有LLM生成内容难以满足要求。

Conclusion: GREP框架有效支持人机协作写作，但LLM生成内容仍需改进。

Abstract: Expert domain writing, such as scientific writing, typically demands
extensive domain knowledge. Recent advances in LLMs show promising potential in
reducing the expert workload. However, evaluating the quality of automatically
generated scientific writing is a crucial open issue, as it requires knowledge
of domain-specific evaluation criteria and the ability to discern expert
preferences. Conventional automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge systems are
insufficient to grasp expert preferences and domain-specific quality standards.
To address this gap and support human-AI collaborative writing, we focus on
related work generation, one of the most challenging scientific tasks, as an
exemplar. We propose GREP, a multi-turn evaluation framework that integrates
classical related work evaluation criteria with expert-specific preferences.
Instead of assigning a single score, our framework decomposes the evaluation
into fine-grained dimensions. This localized evaluation approach is further
augmented with contrastive few-shot examples to provide detailed contextual
guidance for the evaluation dimensions. The design principles allow our
framework to deliver cardinal assessment of quality, which can facilitate
better post-training compared to ordinal preference data. For better
accessibility, we design two variants of GREP: a more precise variant with
proprietary LLMs as evaluators, and a cheaper alternative with open-weight
LLMs. Empirical investigation reveals that our framework is able to assess the
quality of related work sections in a much more robust manner compared to
standard LLM judges, reflects natural scenarios of scientific writing, and
bears a strong correlation with the human expert assessment. We also observe
that generations from state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to satisfy validation
constraints of a suitable related work section. They (mostly) fail to improve
based on feedback as well.

Result: LLMs在主观语言任务中表现出色，但仍面临数据限制、模型偏见等问题。

Conclusion: 该综述为情感计算、比喻语言处理与LLMs交叉领域的研究者提供了宝贵资源，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Subjective language understanding refers to a broad set of natural language
processing tasks where the goal is to interpret or generate content that
conveys personal feelings, opinions, or figurative meanings rather than
objective facts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT, LLaMA, and others, there has been a paradigm shift in how we approach
these inherently nuanced tasks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of recent advances in applying LLMs to subjective language tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, sarcasm detection, humor
understanding, stance detection, metaphor interpretation, intent detection, and
aesthetics assessment. We begin by clarifying the definition of subjective
language from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, and we outline the unique
challenges posed by subjective language (e.g. ambiguity, figurativeness,
context dependence). We then survey the evolution of LLM architectures and
techniques that particularly benefit subjectivity tasks, highlighting why LLMs
are well-suited to model subtle human-like judgments. For each of the eight
tasks, we summarize task definitions, key datasets, state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods, and remaining challenges. We provide comparative insights, discussing
commonalities and differences among tasks and how multi-task LLM approaches
might yield unified models of subjectivity. Finally, we identify open issues
such as data limitations, model bias, and ethical considerations, and suggest
future research directions. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable
resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of
affective computing, figurative language processing, and large-scale language
models.

Abstract: Current speech translation systems, while having achieved impressive
accuracies, are rather static in their behavior and do not adapt to real-world
situations in ways human interpreters do. In order to improve their practical
usefulness and enable interpreting-like experiences, a precise understanding of
the nature of human interpreting is crucial. To this end, we discuss human
interpreting literature from the perspective of the machine translation field,
while considering both operational and qualitative aspects. We identify
implications for the development of speech translation systems and argue that
there is great potential to adopt many human interpreting principles using
recent modeling techniques. We hope that our findings provide inspiration for
closing the perceived usability gap, and can motivate progress toward true
machine interpreting.

Motivation: 现有SiLM模型的评估规模较小且缺乏系统性，本文旨在填补这一空白并比较不同模型的性能。

Method: 比较了Structformer、UDGN和GPST三种SiLM架构，评估其语法表示、语法判断任务表现及训练动态。

Result: GPST在长距离依赖任务中表现最佳，且小模型在大规模合成数据上训练可作为有效测试平台。

Conclusion: 不同SiLM架构各有优劣，GPST表现最稳定，合成数据训练的小模型有助于基础模型评估。

Abstract: Structure-inducing Language Models (SiLM) are trained on a self-supervised
language modeling task, and induce a hierarchical sentence representation as a
byproduct when processing an input. A wide variety of SiLMs have been proposed.
However, these have typically been evaluated on a relatively small scale, and
evaluation of these models has systematic gaps and lacks comparability. In this
work, we study three different SiLM architectures using both natural language
(English) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions: Structformer (Shen et
al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022) and GPST (Hu et al., 2024). We compare
them with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations
(ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics.
We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation
metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect
to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured
Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation
settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in
bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained
on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating
basic model properties.

Conclusion: ASearcher通过简单设计和无外部LLM支持，显著超越现有开源32B代理，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in handling complex, knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating
external tools. Among diverse choices of tools, search tools play a pivotal
role in accessing vast external knowledge. However, open-source agents still
fall short of achieving expert-level Search Intelligence, the ability to
resolve ambiguous queries, generate precise searches, analyze results, and
conduct thorough exploration. Existing approaches fall short in scalability,
efficiency, and data quality. For example, small turn limits in existing online
RL methods, e.g. <=10, restrict complex strategy learning. This paper
introduces ASearcher, an open-source project for large-scale RL training of
search agents. Our key contributions include: (1) Scalable fully asynchronous
RL training that enables long-horizon search while maintaining high training
efficiency. (2) A prompt-based LLM agent that autonomously synthesizes
high-quality and challenging QAs, creating a large-scale QA dataset. Through RL
training, our prompt-based QwQ-32B agent achieves substantial improvements,
with 46.7% and 20.8% Avg@4 gains on xBench and GAIA, respectively. Notably, our
agent exhibits extreme long-horizon search, with tool calls exceeding 40 turns
and output tokens exceeding 150k during training time. With a simple agent
design and no external LLMs, ASearcher-Web-QwQ achieves Avg@4 scores of 42.1 on
xBench and 52.8 on GAIA, surpassing existing open-source 32B agents. We
open-source our models, training data, and codes in

Abstract: Metaphor is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that shapes scientific
understanding, enabling the communication of complex concepts while potentially
constraining paradigmatic thinking. Despite the prevalence of figurative
language in scientific discourse, existing metaphor detection resources
primarily focus on general-domain text, leaving a critical gap for
domain-specific applications. In this paper, we present the Medical Metaphors
Corpus (MCC), a comprehensive dataset of 792 annotated scientific conceptual
metaphors spanning medical and biological domains. MCC aggregates metaphorical
expressions from diverse sources including peer-reviewed literature, news
media, social media discourse, and crowdsourced contributions, providing both
binary and graded metaphoricity judgments validated through human annotation.
Each instance includes source-target conceptual mappings and perceived
metaphoricity scores on a 0-7 scale, establishing the first annotated resource
for computational scientific metaphor research. Our evaluation demonstrates
that state-of-the-art language models achieve modest performance on scientific
metaphor detection, revealing substantial room for improvement in
domain-specific figurative language understanding. MCC enables multiple
research applications including metaphor detection benchmarking, quality-aware
generation systems, and patient-centered communication tools.

Conclusion: 当前搜索代理在大规模信息收集中存在严重不足，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked
by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively
complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated
search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans
from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such
"wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated
due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these
large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated
questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains,
grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale
atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange
it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline
ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We
benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including
single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most
systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer
reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple
human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate
that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale
information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and
development in agentic search. Our dataset, evaluation pipeline, and benchmark
results have been publicly released at https://widesearch-seed.github.io/

Result: OpT-DeUS在持续预训练和监督微调中表现优于现有方法，且插入新层靠近顶部时效率更高。

Conclusion: OpT-DeUS有效解决了神经元排列不匹配问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) yields performance gains but incurs
substantial training costs. Depth up-scaling offers training efficiency by
adding new layers to pre-trained models. However, most existing methods copy or
average weights from base layers, neglecting neuron permutation differences.
This limitation can potentially cause misalignment that harms performance.
Inspired by applying Optimal Transport (OT) for neuron alignment, we propose
Optimal Transport Depth Up-Scaling (OpT-DeUS). OpT-DeUS aligns and fuses
Transformer blocks in adjacent base layers via OT for new layer creation, to
mitigate neuron permutation mismatch between layers. OpT-DeUS achieves better
overall performance and offers improved training efficiency than existing
methods for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning across different
model sizes. To further evaluate the impact of interpolation positions, our
extensive analysis shows that inserting new layers closer to the top results in
higher training efficiency due to shorter back-propagation time while obtaining
additional performance gains.

Abstract: Conversational systems relying on text-based large language models (LLMs)
often overlook paralinguistic cues, essential for understanding emotions and
intentions. Speech-language models (SLMs), which use speech as input, are
emerging as a promising solution. However, SLMs built by extending frozen LLMs
struggle to capture paralinguistic information and exhibit reduced context
understanding. We identify entangled information and improper training
strategies as key issues. To address these issues, we propose two heterogeneous
adapters and suggest a weakly supervised training strategy. Our approach
disentangles paralinguistic and linguistic information, enabling SLMs to
interpret speech through structured representations. It also preserves
contextual understanding by avoiding the generation of task-specific vectors
through controlled randomness. This approach trains only the adapters on common
datasets, ensuring parameter and data efficiency. Experiments demonstrate
competitive performance in emotional conversation tasks, showcasing the model's
ability to effectively integrate both paralinguistic and linguistic information
within contextual settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their increased
accessibility have made it easier than ever for students to automatically
generate texts, posing new challenges for educational institutions. To enforce
norms of academic integrity and ensure students' learning, learning analytics
methods to automatically detect LLM-generated text appear increasingly
appealing. This paper benchmarks the performance of different state-of-the-art
detectors in educational contexts, introducing a novel dataset, called
Generative Essay Detection in Education (GEDE), containing over 900
student-written essays and over 12,500 LLM-generated essays from various
domains. To capture the diversity of LLM usage practices in generating text, we
propose the concept of contribution levels, representing students' contribution
to a given assignment. These levels range from purely human-written texts, to
slightly LLM-improved versions, to fully LLM-generated texts, and finally to
active attacks on the detector by "humanizing" generated texts. We show that
most detectors struggle to accurately classify texts of intermediate student
contribution levels, like LLM-improved human-written texts. Detectors are
particularly likely to produce false positives, which is problematic in
educational settings where false suspicions can severely impact students'
lives. Our dataset, code, and additional supplementary materials are publicly
available at

Motivation: 探讨模型架构对自监督语音表示学习中语言信息的影响，填补现有研究的不足。

Method: 比较HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0的两种架构差异：训练目标和多轮训练迭代的伪标签细化。

Result: 发现训练迭代次数对隐藏表示与词、音素和说话者身份的关联性影响显著，而训练目标影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索迭代细化在自监督语音表示中编码语言信息的有效性原因。

Abstract: Self-supervised models for speech representation learning now see widespread
use for their versatility and performance on downstream tasks, but the effect
of model architecture on the linguistic information learned in their
representations remains under-studied. This study investigates two such models,
HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0, and minimally compares two of their architectural
differences: training objective and iterative pseudo-label refinement through
multiple training iterations. We find that differences in canonical correlation
of hidden representations to word identity, phoneme identity, and speaker
identity are explained by training iteration, not training objective. We
suggest that future work investigate the reason for the effectiveness of
iterative refinement in encoding linguistic information in self-supervised
speech representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 新数据集填补了捷克语ABSA复杂任务的空白，支持跨语言研究，代码和数据公开供非商业研究使用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Czech dataset for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (ABSA), which consists of 3.1K manually annotated reviews from the
restaurant domain. The dataset is built upon the older Czech dataset, which
contained only separate labels for the basic ABSA tasks such as aspect term
extraction or aspect polarity detection. Unlike its predecessor, our new
dataset is specifically designed for more complex tasks, e.g.
target-aspect-category detection. These advanced tasks require a unified
annotation format, seamlessly linking sentiment elements (labels) together. Our
dataset follows the format of the well-known SemEval-2016 datasets. This design
choice allows effortless application and evaluation in cross-lingual scenarios,
ultimately fostering cross-language comparisons with equivalent counterpart
datasets in other languages. The annotation process engaged two trained
annotators, yielding an impressive inter-annotator agreement rate of
approximately 90%. Additionally, we provide 24M reviews without annotations
suitable for unsupervised learning. We present robust monolingual baseline
results achieved with various Transformer-based models and insightful error
analysis to supplement our contributions. Our code and dataset are freely
available for non-commercial research purposes.

*Wenze Xu,Chun Wang,Jiazhen Yu,Sheng Chen,Liang Gao,Weihong Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs struggle with generalization due to speech-text modality gaps. OTReg, a lightweight method using optimal transport, improves alignment and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the modality gap between speech and text in SLMs to enhance generalization.

Method: Introduces OTReg, which formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport problem, adding a regularization loss to training.

Result: OTReg improves speech-text alignment and SLM generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: OTReg effectively mitigates the modality gap, enhancing SLM performance without extra resources.

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to
perceive speech inputs, have gained increasing attention for their potential to
advance speech understanding tasks. However, despite recent progress, studies
show that SLMs often struggle to generalize across datasets, even for trained
languages and tasks, raising concerns about whether they process speech in a
text-like manner as intended. A key challenge underlying this limitation is the
modality gap between speech and text representations. The high variability in
speech embeddings may allow SLMs to achieve strong in-domain performance by
exploiting unintended speech variations, ultimately hindering generalization.
To mitigate this modality gap, we introduce Optimal Transport Regularization
(OTReg), a method that formulates speech-text alignment as an optimal transport
problem and derives a regularization loss to improve SLM training. In each
training iteration, OTReg first establishes a structured correspondence between
speech and transcript embeddings by determining the optimal transport plan,
then incorporates the regularization loss based on this transport plan to
optimize SLMs in generating speech embeddings that align more effectively with
transcript embeddings. OTReg is lightweight, requiring no additional labels or
learnable parameters, and integrates seamlessly into existing SLM training
procedures. Extensive multilingual ASR experiments demonstrate that OTReg
enhances speech-text alignment, mitigates the modality gap, and consequently
improves SLM generalization across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成不可靠内容的问题，提出了一种基于标记级不确定性的可靠性估计方法，以改进不可靠输出的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多轮或代理应用中容易生成流畅但不正确的内容（即虚构），这增加了风险。研究旨在探讨上下文信息如何影响模型行为，以及LLMs是否能识别其不可靠响应。

Method: 提出了一种可靠性估计方法，利用输出logits计算偶然性和认知不确定性，识别显著标记，并将其隐藏状态聚合为紧凑表示，用于响应级可靠性预测。

Result: 实验表明，正确的上下文信息提高了答案准确性和模型置信度，而误导性上下文常导致模型自信地生成错误答案，揭示了不确定性与正确性之间的不一致。提出的探测方法改进了对不可靠输出的检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了直接不确定性信号的局限性，并强调了基于不确定性探测的可靠性感知生成的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent but incorrect
content, known as confabulation, which poses increasing risks in multi-turn or
agentic applications where outputs may be reused as context. In this work, we
investigate how in-context information influences model behavior and whether
LLMs can identify their unreliable responses. We propose a reliability
estimation that leverages token-level uncertainty to guide the aggregation of
internal model representations. Specifically, we compute aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty from output logits to identify salient tokens and
aggregate their hidden states into compact representations for response-level
reliability prediction. Through controlled experiments on open QA benchmarks,
we find that correct in-context information improves both answer accuracy and
model confidence, while misleading context often induces confidently incorrect
responses, revealing a misalignment between uncertainty and correctness. Our
probing-based method captures these shifts in model behavior and improves the
detection of unreliable outputs across multiple open-source LLMs. These results
underscore the limitations of direct uncertainty signals and highlight the
potential of uncertainty-guided probing for reliability-aware generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生物医学NLP任务中选择示例时过于注重代表性而忽视多样性，Dual-Div旨在填补这一空白。

Method: Dual-Div采用两阶段检索和排名：先优化代表性和多样性筛选候选示例，再根据测试查询排名选择最相关且非冗余的示例。

Result: 在三个生物医学NLP任务中，Dual-Div比基线方法性能提升高达5%的宏F1分数，且对提示排列和类别不平衡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始检索阶段的多样性比排名阶段优化更重要，且限制示例数量为3-5个时性能最优。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has leveraged their
in-context learning (ICL) abilities to enable quick adaptation to unseen
biomedical NLP tasks. By incorporating only a few input-output examples into
prompts, LLMs can rapidly perform these new tasks. While the impact of these
demonstrations on LLM performance has been extensively studied, most existing
approaches prioritize representativeness over diversity when selecting examples
from large corpora. To address this gap, we propose Dual-Div, a
diversity-enhanced data-efficient framework for demonstration selection in
biomedical ICL. Dual-Div employs a two-stage retrieval and ranking process:
First, it identifies a limited set of candidate examples from a corpus by
optimizing both representativeness and diversity (with optional annotation for
unlabeled data). Second, it ranks these candidates against test queries to
select the most relevant and non-redundant demonstrations. Evaluated on three
biomedical NLP tasks (named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE),
and text classification (TC)) using LLaMA 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 for inference, along
with three retrievers (BGE-Large, BMRetriever, MedCPT), Dual-Div consistently
outperforms baselines-achieving up to 5% higher macro-F1 scores-while
demonstrating robustness to prompt permutations and class imbalance. Our
findings establish that diversity in initial retrieval is more critical than
ranking-stage optimization, and limiting demonstrations to 3-5 examples
maximizes performance efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL与RAG结合时，LLM容易陷入无效推理路径（dead ends），导致决策不准确，阻碍探索和策略优化。

Method: 提出REX-RAG框架，包含混合采样策略（结合探针采样和探索性提示）和政策校正机制（重要性采样校正分布偏移）。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，REX-RAG在Qwen2.5-3B和Qwen2.5-7B上分别平均提升5.1%和3.6%。

Conclusion: REX-RAG有效解决了RL与RAG结合时的推理路径问题，显著提升了性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling
large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent
advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more
informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge
during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in
unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to
overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and
undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose
REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while
maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional
corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling
Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts
to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs
importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling,
thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven
question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG
achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B
over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple
datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.

metadata, enhancing input representations, and modifying the loss functions to
capture disagreement patterns better. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate substantial improvements in both soft and perspectivist evaluation
metrics across three datasets. We also conduct in-depth error and calibration
analyses, highlighting the conditions under which improvements occur. Our
findings underscore the value of disagreement-aware modeling and offer insights
into how system components interact with the complexity of human-annotated

Result: 在8个NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Llama4 Maverick的推理延迟为每token约4毫秒（批量大小为1），比之前最佳方法快10%。EAGLE-based推测解码在大批量下实现了1.4x至2.0x的加速。

Conclusion: 通过优化技术，EAGLE-based推测解码在生产规模下实现了显著的推理加速，为Llama模型设定了新的性能标杆。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a standard method for accelerating the inference
speed of large language models. However, scaling it for production environments
poses several engineering challenges, including efficiently implementing
different operations (e.g., tree attention and multi-round speculative
decoding) on GPU. In this paper, we detail the training and inference
optimization techniques that we have implemented to enable EAGLE-based
speculative decoding at a production scale for Llama models. With these
changes, we achieve a new state-of-the-art inference latency for Llama models.
For example, Llama4 Maverick decodes at a speed of about 4 ms per token (with a
batch size of one) on 8 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which is 10% faster than the
previously best known method. Furthermore, for EAGLE-based speculative
decoding, our optimizations enable us to achieve a speed-up for large batch
sizes between 1.4x and 2.0x at production scale.

Result: 多项度量与人类不确定性高度对齐，且模型校准表现良好。

Conclusion: 部分度量成功对齐人类不确定性，并显示出良好的模型校准能力。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in evaluating large language models for
uncertainty calibration to facilitate model control and modulate user trust.
Inference time uncertainty, which may provide a real-time signal to the model
or external control modules, is particularly important for applying these
concepts to improve LLM-user experience in practice. While many of the existing
papers consider model calibration, comparatively little work has sought to
evaluate how closely model uncertainty aligns to human uncertainty. In this
work, we evaluate a collection of inference-time uncertainty measures, using
both established metrics and novel variations, to determine how closely they
align with both human group-level uncertainty and traditional notions of model
calibration. We find that numerous measures show evidence of strong alignment
to human uncertainty, even despite the lack of alignment to human answer
preference. For those successful metrics, we find moderate to strong evidence
of model calibration in terms of both correctness correlation and
distributional analysis.

Method: 基于生成文本的确定性特征，通过特征统计与密钥目标对齐的拒绝采样嵌入水印。

Result: 在4个数据集上表现优异，英语F1达99.7%，多比特检测准确率高。

Conclusion: SAEMark为闭源LLM提供了一种可扩展的水印范式，支持内容溯源且不影响文本质量。

Abstract: Watermarking LLM-generated text is critical for content attribution and
misinformation prevention. However, existing methods compromise text quality,
require white-box model access and logit manipulation. These limitations
exclude API-based models and multilingual scenarios. We propose SAEMark, a
general framework for post-hoc multi-bit watermarking that embeds personalized
messages solely via inference-time, feature-based rejection sampling without
altering model logits or requiring training. Our approach operates on
deterministic features extracted from generated text, selecting outputs whose
feature statistics align with key-derived targets. This framework naturally
generalizes across languages and domains while preserving text quality through
sampling LLM outputs instead of modifying. We provide theoretical guarantees
relating watermark success probability and compute budget that hold for any
suitable feature extractor. Empirically, we demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), achieving superior detection
accuracy and text quality. Experiments across 4 datasets show SAEMark's
consistent performance, with 99.7% F1 on English and strong multi-bit detection
accuracy. SAEMark establishes a new paradigm for scalable watermarking that
works out-of-the-box with closed-source LLMs while enabling content
attribution.

Result: GPT-5在所有基准测试中表现最佳，多模态推理能力显著提升。

Conclusion: GPT-5在医学推理任务中超越人类专家，为未来临床决策支持系统设计提供参考。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled general-purpose
systems to perform increasingly complex domain-specific reasoning without
extensive fine-tuning. In the medical domain, decision-making often requires
integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives,
structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist
multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates
its zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based
question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified
protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20
against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU
medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD. Results show that
GPT-5 consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy across all QA benchmarks and delivering substantial gains in
multimodal reasoning. On MedXpertQA MM, GPT-5 improves reasoning and
understanding scores by +29.62% and +36.18% over GPT-4o, respectively, and
surpasses pre-licensed human experts by +24.23% in reasoning and +29.40% in
understanding. In contrast, GPT-4o remains below human expert performance in
most dimensions. A representative case study demonstrates GPT-5's ability to
integrate visual and textual cues into a coherent diagnostic reasoning chain,
recommending appropriate high-stakes interventions. Our results show that, on
these controlled multimodal reasoning benchmarks, GPT-5 moves from
human-comparable to above human-expert performance. This improvement may
substantially inform the design of future clinical decision-support systems.

Method: 采用基于提示的LLM-as-Judge方法，结合专家定义的心理学干预原则进行上下文评估，并使用多维度二元评分增强可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3600次评估中与专家评估一致性最高，且评估理由更易解释。

Conclusion: PsyCrisis-Bench及其评估工具公开可用，以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety alignment of LLM responses in high-risk mental health
dialogues is particularly difficult due to missing gold-standard answers and
the ethically sensitive nature of these interactions. To address this
challenge, we propose PsyCrisis-Bench, a reference-free evaluation benchmark
based on real-world Chinese mental health dialogues. It evaluates whether the
model responses align with the safety principles defined by experts.
Specifically designed for settings without standard references, our method
adopts a prompt-based LLM-as-Judge approach that conducts in-context evaluation
using expert-defined reasoning chains grounded in psychological intervention
principles. We employ binary point-wise scoring across multiple safety
dimensions to enhance the explainability and traceability of the evaluation.
Additionally, we present a manually curated, high-quality Chinese-language
dataset covering self-harm, suicidal ideation, and existential distress,
derived from real-world online discourse. Experiments on 3600 judgments show
that our method achieves the highest agreement with expert assessments and
produces more interpretable evaluation rationales compared to existing
approaches. Our dataset and evaluation tool are publicly available to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: 当前无安全限制的语言模型（如内部工具）未对研究社区开放，限制了对其安全对齐的研究。

Method: 开发了Jinx，一种基于流行开源权重LLM的无拒绝、无安全过滤的变体，保留基础模型的推理和指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Unlimited, or so-called helpful-only language models are trained without
safety alignment constraints and never refuse user queries. They are widely
used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment
evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs
similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require
further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such
models are not available to the research community.
  We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx
responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving
the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It
provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures,
evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in
language model safety.

Conclusion: BIND和Med-GRIM为医疗VQA提供了高效、精确的解决方案，推动了零样本多模态研究。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格控制方面表现优越。

Conclusion: DiTalker提供了一种高效且可控的肖像动画解决方案。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

TL;DR: 论文提出BigTokDetect框架，用于检测TikTok上促进肌肉畸形的有害内容，通过多模态方法提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体难以检测伪装成健身内容的肌肉畸形行为宣传，现有系统主要针对‘瘦理想’，无法有效识别此类复杂内容。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，使用专家标注的多模态数据集BigTok（2200+视频），结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 多模态融合提升检测性能5-10%，视频特征最具区分性，分类准确率达82.9%。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的有害内容检测提供了新基准和工具，支持规模化内容审核。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM是一种基于频率先验的半监督学习方法，通过利用息肉边缘的频率一致性，显著提升了跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决息肉分割中标注数据不足和域适应能力差的问题。

Method: 提出FPGM框架，通过学习域不变频率先验，并对未标注图像进行频谱扰动。

Result: 在六个数据集上达到SOTA，零样本泛化能力提升10% Dice分数。

Conclusion: FPGM在有限监督下显著提升了息肉分割的临床可用性。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉反射的可解释性，发现通过提示LMM验证专用视觉模型的预测可提高识别准确性，并分析了其内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LMMs在视觉任务中的表现及其可解释性，尤其是在与专用视觉模型的对比中。

Method: 方法包括通过提示LMM验证预测、分析视觉反射的内部行为，以及测试训练无连接器对性能的影响。

Result: 结果显示LMMs通过将视觉特征映射为文本概念进行推理，少量文本标记可替代大量视觉标记，且训练无连接器能提升细粒度识别任务性能。

Conclusion: 结论表明视觉反射是提升视觉识别鲁棒性和可解释性的有效策略。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D CNN难以建模长程依赖，而Transformer计算成本高，需要一种兼顾局部和全局特征的方法。

Method: 结合3D CNN提取低层次时空特征和Transformer捕获长程时序依赖，通过融合机制整合两种表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于传统3D CNN和独立Transformer，实现了更高的识别精度和可控复杂度。

Conclusion: 混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在性能和实时性上均达到先进水平，并通过实际场景验证了稳定性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at

TL;DR: 论文提出HOPE基准，通过生成误导性干扰项更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉问题，显著优于现有POPE基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准因采样策略简单且忽略图像特定信息，评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）幻觉问题的效果逐渐减弱。

Method: 提出HOPE基准，利用CLIP选择高预测似然的负对象作为干扰项，并构建真假描述配对以扩展评估范围。

Result: 实验显示HOPE导致多种LVLMs精度下降9%至23%，显著优于POPE。

Conclusion: HOPE基准能更严格评估LVLMs的幻觉问题，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多实例场景（如人-人遮挡、人-物纠缠和背景干扰）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和空间解耦能力的不足。

Method: 提出Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD)策略，将生成过程分解为语义分离的路径，并引入Human Morphology Guidance和Spatially-Modulated Attention。

Result: MILD在挑战性的人像擦除基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过分层扩散和形态引导，有效解决了复杂场景下的人像擦除问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强特征，结合邻域关系和统计先验，提升了3D场景图估计的准确性。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）训练资源密集、定制化成本高的问题，同时支持多样化的应用需求。

Method: 提出 NNObfuscator 机制，通过动态调整模型性能实现单一模型适应多任务需求，支持分层访问控制。

Result: 实验验证表明，NNObfuscator 能有效提升模型适应性，减少计算资源浪费。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator 为 AI 部署提供了高效、可持续的解决方案，支持分层业务模型。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the

improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete

Result: 在KITTI数据集中，REC✓D发现至少24%的错误标注，并生成高质量修正标注作为新基准。

Conclusion: REC✓D框架显著提升标签质量，但现有方法仍遗漏66%的真实错误，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released

### [178] [On the effectiveness of multimodal privileged knowledge distillation in two vision transformer based diagnostic applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06558)
*Simon Baur,Alexandra Benova,Emilio Dolgener Cantú,Jackie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态特权知识蒸馏（MMPKD）方法，利用训练时额外的模态数据指导单模态视觉模型，提升其在胸部X光和乳腺X光中的注意力图定位能力，但效果不跨域通用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床实践中，深度学习模型常需结合多模态数据以提升决策的鲁棒性和可信度，但推理时并非所有模态都可用。

Method: 提出MMPKD训练策略，利用训练时额外的文本和表格数据模态（如MIMIC-CXR和CBIS-DDSM）指导视觉Transformer学生模型。

Result: MMPKD提升了学生模型在输入图像中定位感兴趣区域的零样本能力，但效果不跨域通用。

Conclusion: MMPKD在特定领域内有效，但跨域通用性有限，与先前研究结论相反。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学理论和多感官整合提升了多模态情感识别的效果。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

TL;DR: Surformer v1是一种基于Transformer的架构，用于结合触觉和视觉输入进行表面材料分类，在准确性和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键组成部分，尤其是在结合触觉和视觉输入时。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，结合结构化触觉特征和PCA降维的视觉嵌入，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。

Result: Surformer v1在准确率（99.4%）和推理时间（0.77 ms）上表现优异，优于多模态CNN。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在表面材料识别中提供了准确性和计算效率的平衡，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

Method: 论文提出了一种两阶段对比学习框架：第一阶段训练音频、文本和图像的模态特定编码器；第二阶段通过对比学习训练跨模态编码器，并结合情感、情绪和字幕特征增强检测。

Result: 在ImpliHateVid和HateMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视频仇恨言论检测中有效，且数据集具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了视频隐性仇恨言论检测的空白，提出的框架和数据集为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻媒体的普及需要验证内容真实性，尤其是视觉与文本信息的细粒度一致性，传统方法难以解决。

Method: 提出ContextGuard-LVLM框架，结合视觉语言大模型和多阶段上下文推理机制，通过强化或对抗学习检测细微的上下文不一致。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上显著优于现有零样本基线，尤其在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ContextGuard-LVLM在检测复杂上下文分离方面表现出色，且与人类专家判断高度一致。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based cross-domain image translator in the absence
of paired training data. Unlike GAN-based methods, our approach integrates
diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个挑战性基准上能生成更锐利和更真实的镜面高光。

Conclusion: 这种分解范式为神经场景表示中的复杂外观建模提供了灵活有效的方向。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Conclusion: CausalNet 解决了关键帧索引误差问题，同时保持了高识别精度，推动了微表情识别的实际应用。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Conclusion: 聚类级水印方法在自回归图像模型中表现出色，具有快速验证和强鲁棒性。

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Conclusion: MMFformer在多模态抑郁症检测中表现出色，为社交媒体数据的抑郁症早期诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

Conclusion: Restage4D不仅保留可变形结构，还能自动纠正生成模型的错误，展示了视频先验在4D重动画任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于基础深度学习的FoundBioNet模型，通过多参数MRI非侵入性预测IDH突变状态，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IDH突变检测方法依赖侵入性组织采样，无法捕捉肿瘤空间异质性，且深度学习模型因标注数据稀缺而受限。

Method: 采用SWIN-UNETR架构，结合Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding（TAFE）和Cross-Modality Differential（CMD）模块，从多参数MRI提取特征。

Result: 在1705名患者的六大数据集上验证，AUC达90.58%、88.08%、65.41%和80.31%，显著优于基线方法（p <= 0.05）。

Conclusion: FoundBioNet通过大规模预训练和任务微调，提高了诊断准确性和可解释性，有望实现个性化治疗。

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Result: 在多个公共数据集和自建测试集上显著提升了性能，并优化了YOLO11检测器。

Conclusion: VOccl3D为未来研究提供了更真实的遮挡基准数据集。

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

Conclusion: 该方法生成的精确边缘对医学图像任务具有重要临床价值。

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注负担，同时保留了临床相关的血管拓扑结构。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Conclusion: SAGE-reID是一种高效、无源的MSDA方法，显著提升了模型性能并降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision

methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Conclusion: VSI在中等至长视频问答任务中达到SOTA，证明了其多模态搜索策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

Conclusion: NS-FPN通过噪声抑制和特征融合，有效提升了红外小目标检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BASIC方法，通过直接监督视觉嵌入优化多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将视觉嵌入作为上下文线索，缺乏直接视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC利用LLM浅层中精炼的视觉嵌入作为监督，从嵌入方向和语义匹配两个角度优化初始视觉嵌入。

Result: BASIC显著提升了MLLM在多个基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督有效提升了视觉嵌入的对齐质量，无需额外监督模型或人工标注。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of
generated Chinese character images remains a tough issue. In this paper, we
conduct a holistic survey of the recent Chinese font generation approaches
based on deep learning. To be specific, we first illustrate the research
background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个大规模短视频情感分析数据集eMotions，并设计了AV-CANet网络来解决音频-视觉特征融合的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频的复杂多模态特性为情感分析带来新挑战，现有数据不足且存在主观偏差，需要更高质量的数据集和方法。

Method: 提出多阶段标注流程确保数据质量，设计AV-CANet网络（基于视频Transformer和局部-全局融合模块）及EP-CE损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了AV-CANet的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

### [209] [A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904)
*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过多模态大语言模型和SAM生成精细实例掩码，显著提升伪装目标分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练无关的伪装目标分割方法因语义级提示导致粗糙分割，无法有效处理多实例场景。

Method: IAPF包含文本提示生成器、实例掩码生成器和自一致性投票三步骤，结合MLLM和Grounding DINO生成精细实例掩码。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，IAPF显著优于现有训练无关方法。

Conclusion: IAPF为伪装目标分割提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

*Ruoxi Chen,Dongping Chen,Siyuan Wu,Sinan Wang,Shiyun Lang,Petr Sushko,Gaoyang Jiang,Yao Wan,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiRef-bench评估框架，用于多参考图像生成任务，发现现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉设计通常需要多参考输入，但现有生成框架仅支持单参考输入，限制了创作灵活性。

Method: 提出MultiRef-bench评估框架，包含合成和真实样本，并通过RefBlend生成合成数据。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进模型（如OmniGen）在多参考条件下表现有限，合成样本准确率66.6%，真实样本79.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活的多参考生成工具提供了方向，并公开了数据集MultiRef。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行人重识别模型在多模态数据中泛化能力差，而多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出MMReID-Bench基准，包含20,710个多模态查询和库图像，覆盖10种行人重识别任务。

Result: 实验证明MLLMs在行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时存在局限性。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动开发更鲁棒和通用的多模态基础模型。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

TL;DR: Talk2Image是一种多代理系统，用于多轮对话中的交互式图像生成和编辑，解决了单代理系统的意图漂移和不连贯编辑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成任务多关注单轮场景，难以处理迭代式多轮创作任务，而现有对话系统因单代理顺序范式易导致意图漂移和编辑不连贯。

Method: Talk2Image整合了三个关键组件：从对话历史解析意图、任务分解与专业代理协作执行、基于多视角评估机制的反馈驱动优化。

Result: 实验表明，Talk2Image在可控性、连贯性和用户满意度方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Talk2Image通过多代理协作和反馈机制，实现了用户意图的逐步对齐和一致的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受强化学习在大型语言模型中的成功启发，将其应用于自回归图像生成模型以提升生成质量。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)算法，设计多维度奖励函数评估生成图像质量。

Result: 在类条件和文本条件图像生成任务中，图像质量和人类偏好显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: RL优化为自回归图像生成提供了新方向，支持高质量可控图像合成。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large
language models (LLMs), we propose AR-GRPO, an approach to integrate online RL
training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The
source codes and models are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CannyEdit是一种无需训练的文本到图像编辑框架，通过选择性Canny控制和双提示引导，解决了编辑区域文本依从性、未编辑区域上下文保真度和编辑无缝性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑区域的文本依从性、未编辑区域的上下文保真度和编辑的无缝性之间难以平衡，CannyEdit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CannyEdit采用选择性Canny控制（在可编辑区域应用Canny ControlNet，未编辑区域保留源图像细节）和双提示引导（结合局部和全局提示）。

Result: CannyEdit在真实图像编辑任务中表现优于现有方法，文本依从性和上下文保真度平衡提升2.93%至10.49%，编辑无缝性显著提高。

Conclusion: CannyEdit通过创新方法实现了更精确、无缝的图像编辑，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) is the task of generating sign language video
from spoken language inputs. The field has seen a range of innovations over the
last few years, with the introduction of deep learning-based approaches
providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCOPE的新方法，通过动态增强空间域中的细节和语义特征，解决了频率域方法在细粒度视觉分类中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频率域方法基于固定基函数，缺乏对图像内容的适应性，无法动态调整特征提取。

Method: SCOPE包含两个模块：Subtle Detail Extractor（SDE）动态增强浅层特征中的细节，Salient Semantic Refiner（SSR）从高层特征中学习语义一致的细化特征。

Result: 在四个流行的细粒度图像分类基准测试中达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过动态增强多尺度特征，突破了频率域方法的限制，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击主要关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击未被充分研究，但其潜在影响更大（如经济利益和错误信息传播）。

Method: 提出ViPro攻击方法，通过对抗性手段提升视频排名；引入MoRe技术优化视觉与文本模态的细粒度交互，增强黑盒迁移性。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置下平均分别优于基线方法30%、10%和4%。实验覆盖多种场景和数据集。

Conclusion: ViPro揭示了T2VR的潜在漏洞，提供了攻击的上下界分析，并为防御措施提供了参考。代码将公开。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: 评估了两种基于鱼眼镜头的3D高斯泼溅方法（Fisheye-GS和3DGUT）在真实图像上的表现，分析了它们在极端畸变下的性能，并提出了一种基于深度的初始化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鱼眼镜头在超过180度视场下的3D重建问题，解决传统SfM初始化在强畸变下失效的挑战。

Method: 通过不同视场（200度、160度、120度）评估Fisheye-GS和3DGUT的性能，并提出基于UniK3D预测的深度初始化策略。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场下表现最佳，而3DGUT在所有视场下均稳定且保持高质量。UniK3D策略在稀疏图像输入下实现了与SfM相当的3D重建质量。

Conclusion: 鱼眼3DGS方法在宽角度3D重建中具有实际可行性，适用于稀疏且畸变严重的图像输入。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态建模的文档图像去扭曲方法TADoc，并通过新指标DLS评估效果，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档去扭曲方法在复杂结构和变形下效果不佳，作者认为去扭曲是渐进过程而非一步变换。

Method: 将任务重新建模为动态过程，设计轻量级框架TADoc，并提出新评估指标DLS。

Result: 实验表明TADoc在多种文档类型和变形程度下表现优越。

Conclusion: TADoc通过动态建模和新指标DLS，显著提升了文档去扭曲的效果和评估全面性。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OctreeNCA提出了一种基于八叉树数据结构的NCA改进方法，显著降低了VRAM消耗，提升了高分辨率图像和视频的分割效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗应用需要处理大尺寸输入（如MRI、病理切片或手术视频），但现有模型（如UNet或Vision Transformers）的VRAM消耗成为瓶颈，导致分割效率低下。

Method: 通过八叉树数据结构扩展NCA的邻域定义，实现全局知识的高效传递，并开发了CUDA实现的NCA推理函数以减少VRAM需求和提升速度。

Result: OctreeNCA在评估时VRAM占用比UNet减少90%，能够一次性分割184兆像素的病理切片或1分钟的手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA在保持全局一致性的同时，显著提升了高分辨率图像和视频的分割效率，解决了VRAM瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

Motivation: 现有自监督图像分割模型的多阶段预训练和耗时伪掩码生成过程限制了其扩展性和优化效果。

Method: 提出快速伪掩码算法UniAP并行生成多粒度伪掩码，并基于此设计S2-UniSeg模型，采用师生框架和QuerySD任务进行连续预训练。

Result: S2-UniSeg在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，如COCO上AP提升6.9，UVO上AR提升11.1。

Conclusion: UniAP和S2-UniSeg有效解决了现有方法的局限性，并在大规模数据集上展现出更强的性能。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率文本到图像生成模型的兴起为SVBRDF生成提供了机会，但如何高效生成多图对齐且一致的SVBRDF仍具挑战性。

Method: 引入HiMat框架，采用轻量级CrossStitch模块捕捉图间依赖关系，不改变DiT主干结构。

Result: HiMat能生成具有强结构一致性和高频细节的4K SVBRDF，并通过文本提示验证其有效性。

Conclusion: HiMat在SVBRDF生成任务中表现优异，并可推广至其他任务如本征分解。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

Motivation: 高光谱图像（HSI）包含丰富的光谱信息，但现有自监督方法难以有效利用其复杂的空间-光谱相关性。

Method: 提出TerraMAE框架，采用自适应通道分组策略和增强重建损失函数，以优化空间-光谱嵌入学习。

Result: TerraMAE在高保真图像重建中表现出色，并在作物识别、土地覆盖分类和土壤纹理预测等任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了一种高效的自监督学习解决方案，显著提升了空间-光谱信息的利用效率。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature in PDF format necessitates
advanced tools for efficient and accurate document understanding,
summarization, and content optimization. Traditional methods fall short in
handling complex layouts and multimodal content, while direct application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) lacks

driven by natural language instructions. DocRefine leverages the power of
advanced LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) by orchestrating a sophisticated multi-agent
system comprising six specialized and collaborative agents: Layout & Structure
Analysis, Multimodal Content Understanding, Instruction Decomposition, Content
Refinement, Summarization & Generation, and Fidelity & Consistency
Verification. This closed-loop feedback architecture ensures high semantic
accuracy and visual fidelity. Evaluated on the comprehensive DocEditBench
dataset, DocRefine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across
various tasks, achieving overall scores of 86.7% for Semantic Consistency Score
(SCS), 93.9% for Layout Fidelity Index (LFI), and 85.0% for Instruction
Adherence Rate (IAR). These results demonstrate DocRefine's superior capability
in handling complex multimodal document editing, preserving semantic integrity,
and maintaining visual consistency, marking a significant advancement in
automated scientific document processing.

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model
designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse
visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global
embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large
Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including
object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies
confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and
human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and
reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and
conceptual understanding.

Result: 在公开基准测试中，FOCUS-Med在五项关键指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FOCUS-Med展示了在AI辅助结肠镜检查中的有效性和临床潜力。

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted
colonoscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D表示（如点云、网格和3D高斯）在渲染质量、表面定义和压缩效率上存在局限性，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于点云构建TeSO，将3D场景表示为八叉树组织的立方体边界曲面元素（surfel），每个surfel关联纹理贴图，并通过压缩方案高效编码几何和纹理。

Result: TeSO在较低比特率下实现了比点云和3D高斯基线更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效且高质量的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体和AR/VR应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Conclusion: ForeSight通过无跟踪模型实现了高效的多帧序列处理，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Conclusion: HyComm通过自适应消息选择和标准化数据格式，实现了高效的协作检测，适用于不同代理配置。

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，AugLift将跨数据集性能平均提升10.1%，内部数据集性能提升4.0%。

Conclusion: AugLift是一种模块化方法，能显著提升任何基于提升的姿态估计模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: GANs和DMs各有优势，需进一步优化以确保生成模型能可靠地用于AI诊断系统的训练数据增强。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet通过全面掩码引导和多尺度特征提取，显著提升了壁画修复的质量和真实性。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过显式建模意图和优化扩散过程，显著提高了行人轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SketchAnimator的草图动画模型，通过三个阶段为静态草图添加动态效果，无需专业动画技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草图动画通常需要专业技能且耗时，业余爱好者难以完成。本文旨在简化这一过程。

Method: 分为三个阶段：外观学习、运动学习和视频先验蒸馏，利用LoRA和SDS技术从参考视频中提取动态信息。

Result: 模型生成的草图视频既保留了原始外观，又复现了参考视频的动态效果，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator为草图动画提供了一种高效且易于使用的解决方案。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Conclusion: CoopDiff通过解耦建模和一致性约束，显著提升了人-物交互预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for
tasks such as salient object detection. However, achieving this capability in
lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between
efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale
feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise
separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating
multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for
salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with
only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models
in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the
challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates
the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks. The related

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RVOS方法忽视表达式的语义结构，而视频引用表达式更复杂，包含事件属性和时间关系，传统方法难以处理。

Method: EventRR分为对象总结和引用推理两部分：总结阶段生成瓶颈令牌并聚合全局跨模态时间上下文；推理阶段通过REG和TCRR进行语义推理。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，EventRR在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EventRR通过结构化语义推理显著提升了RVOS任务的性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法通过更精确的退化建模，有效提升了真实世界超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有IML模型主要依赖视觉线索，忽略了内容特征的语义逻辑关系，而篡改通常会破坏这些关系，留下语义线索。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成文本信息补充视觉语义关系，引入图像-文本中心模糊模块（ITCAM）和图像-文本交互模块（ITIM），并设计恢复边缘解码器（RED）保持边界信息。

Result: 实验表明CMB-Net优于现有大多数IML模型。

Conclusion: CMB-Net通过多模态融合和边界保持机制，显著提升了IML的准确性。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Result: 混合方法在各种镜头类型和噪声污染下表现优异，提高了校准精度和稳定性。

Conclusion: 混合校准方法为复杂场景下的相机校准提供了可靠且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

Result: 在ACDC、Synapse和BTMS数据集上，ASM-UNet在粗粒度和细粒度分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ASM-UNet通过动态扫描顺序解决了FGS中的个体差异问题，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

Result: 实验证明MiraMo在生成一致性、平滑性和可控性动画方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MiraMo在图像动画中表现出高效性和多功能性，适用于运动迁移和视频编辑。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,

### [248] [Understanding Dynamic Scenes in Ego Centric 4D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07251)
*Junsheng Huang,Shengyu Hao,Bocheng Hu,Gaoang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoDynamic4D是一个新的QA基准数据集，用于动态4D场景理解，包含RGB-D视频、相机姿态、实例掩码和4D边界框，支持12种动态QA任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏统一的4D标注和任务驱动的评估协议，无法支持细粒度的时空推理，尤其是物体和人的运动及其交互。

Method: 提出了一个端到端的时空推理框架，结合动态和静态场景信息，通过实例感知特征编码、时间和相机编码以及空间自适应下采样，将大型4D场景压缩为LLM可处理的令牌序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EgoDynamic4D上表现优于基线，验证了多模态时间建模对动态场景理解的有效性。

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D和提出的方法为动态4D场景理解提供了新的基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Small-Large Collaboration (SLC)的协作框架，通过小型和大型视觉语言模型的协作实现个性化，同时避免高训练成本和推理能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽然多模态理解能力强，但训练成本高且难以个性化；小型VLMs易于个性化但推理能力不足。

Method: SLC框架中，小型VLM生成个性化信息，大型VLM整合信息并生成准确响应，采用测试时反射策略防止小型VLM的幻觉。

Result: 实验证明SLC框架在各种基准测试和大型VLM中有效，且训练高效。

Conclusion: SLC是首个支持开源和闭源大型VLM的训练高效框架，推动了现实世界个性化应用的发展。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

TL;DR: OpenHAIV框架整合了OOD检测、新类发现和增量持续微调，解决了开放世界场景中的知识更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放世界场景中，现有方法（如OOD检测和增量学习）存在局限性，无法自主更新知识或依赖监督条件。

Method: 提出OpenHAIV框架，将OOD检测、新类发现和增量持续微调统一为一个流程。

Result: 框架支持模型在开放世界中自主获取和更新知识。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Result: 实验证明该方法在CNN和ViT中均有效，揭示了模型的潜在脆弱性和决策边界。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性和解释价值，为深度神经网络的可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

TL;DR: SynMatch通过合成图像匹配伪标签，解决了医学图像分割中标签稀缺问题，无需额外训练参数，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标签稀缺是深度学习医学图像分割的主要挑战，现有方法因伪标签与未标记图像不一致而受限。

Method: SynMatch利用分割模型提取纹理和形状特征，合成与伪标签高度一致的图像，无需训练参数。

Result: 在SSL、WSL和BSL设置下表现优异，尤其在BSL中，比现有方法提升29.71%和10.05%。

Conclusion: SynMatch通过合成图像匹配伪标签，显著提升了医学图像分割性能，尤其在标签稀缺场景下。

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上达到81.0% mIoU（预训练后），实时速度为33 FPS。

Conclusion: BEVANet通过创新的注意力机制和架构设计，实现了实时语义分割的高性能和高效性。

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

Abstract: Dragon fruit, renowned for its nutritional benefits and economic value, has
experienced rising global demand due to its affordability and local

into four categories: fresh, immature, mature, and defective fruits to ensure
robust model training. The proposed model achieves an impressive 93.98%
accuracy, outperforming existing methods in fruit quality classification. To
facilitate practical adoption, we embedded the model into an intuitive mobile
application, enabling farmers and agricultural stakeholders to conduct
on-device, real-time quality inspections. This research provides an accurate,

supporting digital agriculture and empowering smallholder farmers with
accessible technology. By bridging the gap between research and real-world
application, our work advances post-harvest management and promotes sustainable
farming practices.

Abstract: Continual learning aims to equip AI systems with the ability to continuously
acquire and adapt to new knowledge without forgetting previously learned
information, similar to human learning. While traditional continual learning

catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal
interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we
introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for
continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib,
we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal
Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully

Abstract: Efficient lightweight neural networks are with increasing attention due to
their faster reasoning speed and easier deployment on mobile devices. However,
existing video pre-trained models still focus on the common ViT architecture
with high latency, and few works attempt to build efficient architecture on
mobile devices. This paper bridges this gap by introducing temporal structural
reparameterization into an efficient image-text model and training it on a
large-scale high-quality video-text dataset, resulting in an efficient
video-text model that can run on mobile devices with strong zero-shot
classification and retrieval capabilities, termed as MobileViCLIP. In
particular, in terms of inference speed on mobile devices, our
MobileViCLIP-Small is 55.4x times faster than InternVideo2-L14 and 6.7x faster
than InternVideo2-S14. In terms of zero-shot retrieval performance, our
MobileViCLIP-Small obtains similar performance as InternVideo2-L14 and obtains
6.9\% better than InternVideo2-S14 on MSR-VTT. The code is available at

Method: 采用EviGRPO框架，结合证据感知奖励机制和课程学习策略，构建EviBench和ArxivFullQA数据集。

Result: DocR1在多页任务中达到最先进性能，同时在单页任务中保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架和高质量数据集有效提升了多页文档理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently
maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

TL;DR: RORPCap提出了一种基于检索的对象和关系提示方法，用于图像描述生成，解决了传统方法中冗余检测信息、GCN构建困难和训练成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像描述方法依赖对象检测器或结合GCN，存在冗余信息、构建复杂和训练成本高的问题。RORPCap通过利用图像-文本检索的丰富语义信息，提出了一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: RORPCap通过对象和关系提取模型获取图像中的对象和关系词，将其嵌入预定义提示模板，并设计基于Mamba的映射网络将CLIP提取的图像嵌入快速映射为视觉-文本嵌入，最终结合GPT-2生成描述。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上，RORPCap仅需2.6小时训练，达到120.5% CIDEr和22.0% SPICE分数，性能与检测器和GCN模型相当，训练时间最短。

Conclusion: RORPCap展示了作为图像描述替代方案的潜力，具有高效性和竞争力。

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频中语言与视觉对齐的复杂性，包括语言的多变性、实体交互的动态性以及语义鸿沟问题。

Method: Planner模块分解复杂语言提示为短句链，Refiner模块通过名词-动词对指导视觉令牌的自注意力，实现高效单步优化。

Result: 在Referring Video Object Segmentation和Temporal Grounding任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂提示下效果显著。

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner框架在视频-语言对齐任务中具有潜力，尤其适用于复杂语言场景。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

Result: 在RefCOCO/+/g数据集上性能提升+5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0%。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为MLLMs在VG任务中的优化提供了系统支持，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Result: CoAR在主题和风格个性化任务中表现优异，计算和内存效率显著提升，仅调整0.05%参数。

Conclusion: CoAR为定制化图像生成提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应去噪策略，有效提升了JPEG伪影去除的性能。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

Motivation: 2D高斯泼溅在大规模和复杂城市场景中性能下降，导致建筑重建不完整。

Method: GS4Buildings直接从低细节语义3D建筑模型初始化高斯，并整合先验深度和法线图优化重建过程。

Result: 实验显示重建完整性提升20.5%，几何精度提升32.8%，高斯基元减少71.8%。

Conclusion: 语义建筑模型整合推动高斯泼溅技术在城市应用中的潜力，如智慧城市和数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上泛化能力差的问题，避免耗时和依赖额外数据的传统方法。

Method: 通过模块分解发现关键接口，集成特征调整器，采用物理感知的无监督损失和分块并行推理。

Result: 在跨传感器情况下显著提升性能，训练和推理速度极快（如512x512x8图像仅需0.2秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法在质量和效率上均达到最优，适用于实际应用中的跨传感器问题。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

Motivation: 3DGS在稀疏视图重建中表现不佳，DIP-GS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用Deep Image Prior的内部结构和模式，采用由粗到细的方式改进3DGS。

Result: DIP-GS在稀疏视图重建任务中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: DIP-GS无需预训练模型，在稀疏视图场景中表现优异。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs无法有效处理长事件流或保留关键视觉细节，需要一种新方法来填补事件流与文本之间的模态鸿沟。

Method: 采用自适应压缩机制减少输入事件量，结合两阶段优化和文本引导的跨模态查询，通过层次聚类和相似性计算提取代表性特征。

Result: LET-US在长事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLMs，并在多个任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流与文本的跨模态理解开辟了新方向，其数据集和模型将公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，对抗攻击下性能显著提升。

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM在对抗鲁棒性和伪造检测定位任务中均达到领先水平。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current

Conclusion: CLUE为伪造图像定位提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练数据中继承了性别偏见，需要明确偏见来源并开发高效去偏方法。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强（CDA）和基于新指标Degree of Stereotypicality的DAUDoS方法进行去偏。

Result: CDA减少性别差距6%，DAUDoS减少3%但仅需三分之一数据；两种方法均提升性别识别准确率3%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器（如CLIP）和文本编码器（如PaliGemma2）对偏见的贡献不同，未来可针对性优化。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关，适用于多种无监督骨干网络，为实际场景中不完美的训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

Motivation: 针对居家健身爱好者缺乏专业指导的问题，开发一个实时、互动的AI训练伙伴。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）分析用户动作，并通过Web界面提供实时反馈。基于1,700对专家标注的视频数据集进行模型评估。

Result: 模型表现与人类教练水平仍有显著差距，但展示了AI在动作分析中的潜力。

Conclusion: FormCoach为AI驱动的健身教练开辟了新方向，强调了人机协作在动作纠正中的重要性。

Abstract: Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the
fast-growing community of at-home fitness enthusiasts, expert feedback is often
out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on,
interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and
delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models
(VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark
state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference
video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research
in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated,
rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across
models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level
coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating
nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By
framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans
and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.

Motivation: 传统的手动视觉评估方法耗时、费力且主观，自动化物种和损害识别能显著提高效率和一致性。

Method: 结合通用自监督视觉模型与植物分类层次推理的分割模型，使用多国多年数据集进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型显著提升了物种识别（F1分数：0.52到0.85）和损害分类（F1分数：0.28到0.44）的性能，在跨设备测试中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 模型具有强鲁棒性和实际应用价值，已被部署于大规模自动化作物和杂草监测中。

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构被Transformer扩散模型取代，MM-DiT的双向注意力机制对现有编辑技术提出了挑战。

Method: 通过分解注意力矩阵为四个块，分析其特性，提出适用于MM-DiT的全局到局部图像编辑方法。

Result: 提出了一种鲁棒的编辑方法，适用于多种MM-DiT变体，包括少步模型。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net方法与新兴架构之间的差距，提供了对MM-DiT行为模式的深入理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

Motivation: 医学图像诊断的准确性至关重要，但噪声标签和类别模糊实例会干扰top-rank学习的目标，导致误诊。

Method: 提出了一种集成拒绝模块的新方法，与top-rank损失协同优化，通过拒绝函数识别和减少异常值的影响。

Result: 在医学数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法能有效检测和减少异常值，提升诊断的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 结合拒绝模块的top-rank学习方法显著改善了医学图像诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对中文文本图像超分辨率（SR）的框架，通过引入结构先验和StyleGAN模型，实现了对低分辨率字符的精确恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注英文文本，对更复杂的中文脚本关注较少，因此需要一种能够恢复中文字符精确笔画的SR方法。

Method: 提出了一种结构先验，结合StyleGAN模型和基于代码书的机制，生成与低分辨率字符空间和结构对齐的高分辨率先验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够准确恢复退化字符的清晰笔画，适用于具有不规则布局的真实低分辨率中文文本。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构先验和StyleGAN的协作，为中文文本图像超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的去标识化对于保护患者隐私至关重要，同时需确保数据在研究和诊断中的实用性。

Result: 算法在挑战中正确执行了99.92%的操作，排名第二。

Conclusion: 论文总结了当前方法的局限性，并提出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖多医院数据，但数据收集困难。本文关注WSI内的域偏移（如患者特征和组织厚度）。

Method: 聚类非肿瘤区域的WSI级特征作为域，采用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）减少特征差距。

Result: 有效减少了不同聚类间WSI对的特征差距。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用WSI内域偏移，提供了一种实用的域泛化解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

Result: 实验表明CoT-Pose能从抽象文本生成语义对齐且合理的3D姿势。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高级理解在姿势生成中的重要性，为推理增强方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Result: MatchVoice表现出良好的泛化能力，但需结合更广泛的视频-语言技术以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究展示了MatchVoice在足球集锦解说中的潜力，但需进一步整合其他技术以优化性能。

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The

Conclusion: SOFA首次整合模拟、预测和优化，为个性化消融提供新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法将3D目标检测性能提升了3.89%（NDS指标）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能，验证了其在自动驾驶感知和规划中的实用性。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

Result: 实验表明模型达到最先进性能，并生成可解释、可验证的推理链。

Conclusion: TAR-TVG通过显式监督推理过程，显著提升了时间视频定位的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

Result: 在15个基准数据集上的实验表明，ACE在分布偏移场景中优于现有TTA方法，具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ACE通过自适应缓存和动态决策边界显著提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LayerNorm在Vision Transformers（ViTs）中的微调动态，提出了一种基于Fine-tuning Shift Ratio（FSR）的重新缩放机制，以优化目标域适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LayerNorm在ViTs中至关重要，但其在数据稀缺和域转移下的微调动态尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种基于FSR的重新缩放机制，结合循环框架，优化LayerNorm微调。

Result: 实验验证了该框架在自然和病理图像中的有效性，OOD任务通常需要更高的重新缩放因子。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，并提供了实用的微调策略。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Conclusion: GAPNet通过高效特征融合和粒度感知监督，显著提升了轻量级SOD模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

Conclusion: UniSVG数据集为SVG理解和生成任务提供了统一解决方案，推动了MLLMs在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

Conclusion: 该框架为语音病理的早期检测提供了自动化解决方案，支持AI驱动的医疗保健并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

Result: 在工业和医学基准测试中表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架能有效提升基础模型在密集感知任务中的适应性。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

Motivation: 人类能够通过第三人称演示直观地理解功能部分，而无需像素级标注。现有模型依赖分类器，常关注与功能无关的类特定模式，因此需要改进。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效将激活从无关区域转移到有意义的功能线索上。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过自适应学习功能相关线索，显著提升了弱监督功能定位的性能。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法有效抑制了截断伪影，提高了图像质量。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法显著改善了牙科CBCT的图像质量。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

Motivation: 现有物体检测模型未能充分利用静态环境中的空间先验，导致检测不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体间的空间关系，修正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可将mAP@50提升高达4%。

Conclusion: 通过利用环境的空间结构，显著提高了物体检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511
and 0.9035, respectively.

TL;DR: Omni-Effects提出了一种统一框架，支持提示引导的视觉特效生成和空间可控的复合特效，解决了现有方法在多特效联合训练中的干扰和空间不可控问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在视觉特效（VFX）生产中受限于单特效训练，无法实现多特效的空间可控生成，限制了应用场景。

Method: 提出了LoRA-MoE（基于LoRA的专家混合）和SAP（空间感知提示）两大创新，结合IIF模块，实现多特效的统一生成和精确空间控制。

Result: 实验表明，Omni-Effects能够精确控制特效的空间位置和类别，支持多样化的特效生成。

Conclusion: Omni-Effects为多特效的统一生成和空间控制提供了有效解决方案，推动了VFX生产的发展。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR-VRM通过从人类动作视频中学习手部关键点，并利用类比推理将人类动作映射到机器人组件，显著提升了视觉机器人操作的性能，尤其在数据稀缺场景下表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉机器人操作方法因依赖与机器人任务不匹配的网络数据或隐式训练方式，在机器人数据不足时泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出AR-VRM方法，通过关键点视觉语言模型（VLM）从人类动作视频中学习手部关键点，并在机器人数据微调时使用类比推理（AR）将人类动作映射到机器人组件。

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试和真实实验中表现领先，尤其在少样本场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过显式模仿人类动作并关注动作关键点，AR-VRM在数据稀缺情况下展现出更强的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的图像生成算法，通过体积渲染原理精确控制图像中物体间的遮挡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示或布局控制遮挡关系，但缺乏精确性，无法显式处理遮挡。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型，在潜在空间中基于遮挡关系和物体透射率进行体积渲染。

Result: 在遮挡准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能通过调整物体透明度等实现多种效果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，基于物理原理实现了精确的遮挡控制，扩展了图像生成的应用场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR数据的高质量标注困难且易受噪声标签影响，现有方法主要针对图像数据，难以直接应用于SAR数据。

Method: 设计多模型特征融合框架，结合散射特征和深度特征；使用高斯混合模型（GMM）划分干净和噪声标签样本；通过半监督学习和联合分布对齐策略优化模型。

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均能达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法有效解决了SAR ATR中的噪声标签问题，提升了识别性能。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

miniaturization, self-supervised learning, and foundation models. As HSI
evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法在长袖转短袖场景中因皮肤恢复不准确导致效果不真实，UR-VTON旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用“脱衣-穿衣”机制分解任务，结合动态分类器自由引导调度和结构细化器提升细节保真度。

Result: UR-VTON在细节保留和图像质量上优于现有方法，并提出了新基准LS-TON。

Conclusion: UR-VTON为长袖转短袖虚拟试衣提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决传统跟踪方法因缺乏几何感知而难以应对遮挡和深度模糊的问题。

Method: 集成单目深度估计和实例分割，生成3D点云，使用体素化3D IoU进行空间关联，并引入深度感知的自适应噪声补偿和运动方向一致性。

Conclusion: GRASPTrack通过深度感知和3D几何推理有效解决了遮挡和深度模糊问题，提升了多目标跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

Conclusion: 该方法为3D内容编辑提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案，无需额外调参即可实现几何对齐。

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法通过约束深度图和法线对齐，实现了几何深度统一和高精度重建，适用于小规模室内外场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

Conclusion: TriReWeight能有效提升生成数据增强的性能，理论分析和实验结果均验证其优越性。

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

Conclusion: GSD是一种高效、无需额外训练的自回归图像模型加速方法。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

TL;DR: CAV-SAM提出了一种轻量级方法，通过将参考-目标图像对的对应关系表示为伪视频，利用SAM2的iVOS能力适应下游任务，性能提升超过5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考分割方法依赖元学习，需要大量数据和计算成本，CAV-SAM旨在以更轻量的方式实现模型适应。

Method: 将参考-目标图像对视为伪视频，利用SAM2的iVOS能力，结合DBST模块（扩散模型构建语义转换序列）和TTGA模块（测试时几何对齐）。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，分割性能提升超过5%。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM为视觉模型适应提供了一种高效轻量的新方法。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在初始时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，与高斯噪声潜在分布存在差距，限制了生成先验的有效利用。

Method: 提出OMGSR框架，在中时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，并引入潜在分布细化损失和重叠分块LPIPS/GAN损失。

Result: OMGSR-S/F在512分辨率下表现优异，OMGSR-F在所有参考指标中占据主导地位，1k和2k分辨率下也表现良好。

Conclusion: OMGSR框架有效解决了潜在分布差距问题，提升了真实图像超分辨率的生成质量。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出Next Shot Generation (NSG)框架Cut2Next，通过Diffusion Transformer和分层多提示策略生成符合专业剪辑模式的高质量镜头，提升叙事流畅性和电影连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注基础视觉一致性，忽略了剪辑模式对叙事流畅性的重要性，导致输出缺乏叙事复杂性和电影完整性。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)和分层多提示策略（Relational Prompts和Individual Prompts），结合Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)技术。

Result: 实验显示Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究验证其对剪辑模式和电影连贯性的高度符合。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在保持视角一致性和处理复杂场景动态方面存在困难，尤其是在大规模环境中。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先通过少样本学习从单张图像预测最佳相机轨迹，然后通过姿态条件扩散过程生成几何一致的多视角序列，最终转换为持久的4D表示。

Result: 该框架首次结合了视频扩散模型的丰富时间先验和重建模型的几何感知能力，在4D生成质量和指标（如mPSNR、mSSIM）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Dream4D通过协同可控视频生成和神经4D重建，显著提升了4D内容合成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有零样本学习中的语义原型是人工定义的，可能因实例级不匹配和类级不精确导致监督噪声，影响知识迁移效果。

Method: 提出CLZSL框架，包含PCL模块（基于样本与原型相似度的课程学习）和PUP模块（动态更新语义原型）。

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL通过减少实例级和类级噪声，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决SO(3)外推中的挑战，如未知物理量、非保守动力学和噪声观测下的状态估计。

Method: 利用神经控制微分方程和SO(3) Savitzky-Golay路径建模轨迹，不依赖能量或动量守恒假设。

Result: 模型在仿真和实际场景中表现出鲁棒的外推能力，适用于未知物理参数的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂非惯性系统中具有广泛适用性，且易于集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 片段化方法为步态识别提供了新的视角，展示了多尺度时间上下文学习的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

Motivation: 当前主动防御策略缺乏持久性，攻击者可通过收集受保护样本和重新训练模型绕过防御。

Method: 提出TSDF框架，利用强度分离机制设计双功能对抗扰动，直接扭曲伪造结果并破坏攻击者的数据准备过程。

Result: 实验表明TSDF具有强大的双重防御能力，显著提高了防御的持久性。

Conclusion: TSDF框架通过双功能对抗扰动有效阻止攻击者模型适应防御扰动，确保长期防御效果。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，MambaTrans显著提升了多模态图像在下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: MambaTrans通过最小化检测损失和捕获长程依赖关系，有效适配预训练模型，无需调整其参数。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在3D姿态生成中存在模糊性和任务对齐不足的问题，需要更有效的优化方法。

Method: 提出Pose-RFT框架，结合离散语言预测和连续姿态生成的混合动作强化学习，并引入HyGRPO算法进行奖励归一化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化学习微调在3D姿态生成中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

Motivation: 传统回归方法生成不真实细节且需大量配对数据，生成扩散模型难以保证时间一致性。

Result: 在视频修复基准测试中达到零样本最优性能，时间一致性和细节保留表现优异。

Conclusion: DiTVR通过创新注意力机制和采样器设计，解决了视频修复中的时间一致性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

Motivation: 现有SAR-光学图像匹配方法依赖大量人工标注，耗时且复杂。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上表现优于半监督方法，与全监督SOTA方法竞争。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR高效实用，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

TL;DR: RSFIQA是一种细粒度的无参考图像质量评估模型，通过动态分割图像并结合多模态大语言模型提取区域特征，利用区域感知语义注意力机制提升质量评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NR-IQA方法在全局表示或区域特征加权上存在不足，无法充分感知语义显著区域或局部质量变化。

Method: 利用SAM动态分割图像，结合MLLM提取区域内容与多维失真信息，引入RSA机制聚合局部特征生成全局注意力图。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出竞争性的质量预测性能。

Conclusion: RSFIQA通过区域级失真信息与语义注意力机制，显著提升了无参考图像质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: MIMIC框架通过合成视觉概念来可视化VLMs的内部表示，提升模型透明度和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs的复杂架构导致其内部表示难以解释，限制了透明度和信任。

Method: MIMIC结合VLM反演和特征对齐目标，并引入空间对齐、图像平滑和语义真实性的正则化。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，MIMIC成功反演了多种自由文本的视觉概念。

Conclusion: MIMIC是首个针对VLM视觉概念解释的反演方法。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过无标注的领域相关图像-文本对继续预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs），以提升其在组织病理学任务中的零样本和小样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通用视觉语言模型（如CONCH和QuiltNet）在组织病理学中表现出色，但其通用设计可能导致在特定任务中表现不佳。本文旨在通过无标注的继续预训练方法解决这一问题。

Method: 通过从现有数据库中提取领域和任务相关的图像-文本对，对VLMs进行继续预训练。实验在CONCH和QuiltNet模型上进行，覆盖三个下游任务。

Result: 实验表明，这种无标注的继续预训练方法显著提升了零样本和小样本性能，且在更大训练规模下，性能可与小样本方法媲美。

Conclusion: 无标注的继续预训练方法具有任务无关性和高效性，为VLMs在组织病理学任务中的适应提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CBDES MoE的分层解耦混合专家架构，用于解决多模态BEV感知系统的输入适应性、建模能力和泛化性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BEV感知系统在多传感器特征融合中存在输入适应性有限、建模能力不足和泛化性能差的问题。

Method: 采用分层解耦的混合专家架构（CBDES MoE），结合轻量级自注意力路由机制（SAR），实现动态专家路径选择和稀疏高效推理。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，CBDES MoE在3D目标检测中表现优于单专家模型，mAP提升1.6点，NDS提升4.1点。

Conclusion: CBDES MoE通过模块化混合专家框架显著提升了BEV感知系统的性能，具有实际应用优势。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Motivation: 研究Ge表面微结构的形态变化与辐照参数的关系。

Method: 处理电子显微镜图像提取拓扑特征，用图卷积网络嵌入，PCA分析聚类效果。

Result: 辐照角度对Ge表面形态的影响比辐照剂量更显著。

Conclusion: 辐照角度是影响Ge表面微结构形态的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, electron microscopy images of microstructures formed on Ge
surfaces by ion beam irradiation were processed to extract topological features
as skeleton graphs, which were then embedded using a graph convolutional
network. The resulting embeddings were analyzed using principal component
analysis, and cluster separability in the resulting PCA space was evaluated
using the Davies-Bouldin index. The results indicate that variations in
irradiation angle have a more significant impact on the morphological
properties of Ge surfaces than variations in irradiation fluence.

Result: 鸡组织模型上追踪误差低至1.1 mm（速度10 mm/s），验证了方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于TAP的模型在复杂手术场景中具有准确无标记3D追踪的潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive
structures, and enable context-aware robotic assistance during complex
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel method for markerless 3D tissue
tracking by leveraging 2D Tracking Any Point (TAP) networks. Our method
combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for
accurate, markerless 3D tracking in challenging surgical scenarios.

Conclusion: HuMo100M数据集和Being-M0.5模型显著推动了运动生成技术的实际应用，为未来实用运动生成器的开发提供了设计指导和计算分析。

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CATP的训练无关的图像令牌剪枝方法，针对多模态上下文学习（ICL），通过两阶段渐进剪枝减少冗余令牌，提升效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像令牌剪枝方法主要针对单图像任务，忽视了多模态ICL中更大的冗余和效率需求，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出CATP方法，通过两阶段渐进剪枝处理多模态输入中的复杂跨模态交互，减少77.8%的图像令牌。

Result: 在四个LVLM和八个基准测试中，CATP平均性能提升0.6%，推理延迟降低10.78%。

Conclusion: CATP提升了多模态ICL的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交织场景的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数高效的All-in-One图像修复框架，通过任务感知增强提示处理多种恶劣天气退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种退化类型设计专用网络模块或参数，导致参数开销大且忽略任务间相关性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式（预训练和提示调优），使用低秩分解和对比约束增强任务感知提示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅用2.75M参数即可实现优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在参数效率和任务建模准确性上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

Motivation: 现有方法参数过多且与其他AIGC工具不兼容，需解决身份保留问题。

Method: 在预训练视频生成模型中引入条件图像分支，通过受限自注意力实现身份控制。

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效且多功能，适用于多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

Conclusion: 该方法可迭代优化CER和对齐质量，并发布了修正数据集和代码。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Motivation: 传统视频抠图方法因缺乏高质量真实数据而受限，现有数据集通常基于人工标注的alpha和前景，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出两阶段解决方案：1）利用合成和伪标注分割数据集进行大规模预训练；2）开发一种新型视频抠图架构，利用预训练视频扩散模型的先验知识，实现时间一致性。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的定量评估显示性能优越，定性结果在多样真实场景中展示了强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据和预训练模型的有效结合，显著提升了视频抠图的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

Result: 实验表明，Mem4D在保持高效率的同时，实现了最先进或竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过双内存架构有效解决了动态场景重建中的内存需求问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory
compliance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有零样本视频时间定位方法存在语义碎片化和相似性分布偏差问题，且依赖昂贵的LLMs推理。

Method: 提出TAG方法，结合时间池化、时间一致性聚类和相似性调整，无需训练即可捕捉视频时间上下文。

Result: 在Charades-STA和ActivityNet Captions数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的零样本视频时间定位方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代面部识别系统因数据复制和用户数据控制缺失引发隐私和伦理问题。

Method: 使用视觉秘密共享存储训练数据，提出基于补丁的多训练网络。

Result: 在 VGGFace2 数据集上验证了 VOIDFace 在隐私、安全性和性能上的优势。

Conclusion: VOIDFace 提升了面部识别系统的隐私、安全性和数据控制能力。

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Result: 关联准确性提升11%，实现持久身份跟踪，支持个性化智能系统。

Conclusion: TrackOR通过3D信息实现高效跟踪，为手术室团队效率与安全提供新应用可能。

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

TL;DR: 论文指出多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在盲人和视障人士（BVI）辅助技术中存在关键缺陷，即无法感知电梯运行方向（Escalator Problem），并提出‘隐式运动盲区’概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示MLLMs在动态环境中的感知局限，尤其是对连续低信号运动的识别不足，影响用户信任。

Method: 通过分析现有视频理解框架的采样范式，指出其将视频视为静态图像序列的缺陷。

Result: 提出‘隐式运动盲区’概念，并强调其对用户安全和信任的负面影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知，开发以用户需求为中心的新基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有Vision Foundation Models（VFMs）虽在对象中心数据上表现优异，但在群体动态建模上未充分探索，直接替换CNN骨干网络效果有限。

Method: 提出ProGraD方法，包括可学习的群体提示引导VFM注意力，以及轻量级GroupContext Transformer推断演员-群体关联和集体行为。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD基准测试中超越现有技术，多群体场景下提升6.5%（Group mAP@1.0）和8.2%（Group mAP@0.5），仅需10M可训练参数。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅性能优越，还能生成可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供洞察。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 解决主流AutoDA方法搜索耗时或性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出SRA，结合启发式评分模块和非对称增强策略，动态调整增强策略。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，并展示良好的兼容性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRA为更简单、有效且实用的AutoDA设计提供了方向。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 实验显示，在临床真实场景中，RGB模型性能下降12%，而几何方法表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 几何表示能捕捉更有意义的生物特征，为手术室中鲁棒的人员建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MAE和RMSE分别提升12.87%和9.08%。

Conclusion: TRIDE通过多模态融合和天气适应机制，显著提升了深度估计的精度。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种生成模型（如Sora、Lumiere等）上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成高质量3D视频提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

Conclusion: PrIINeR融合深度学习和INR技术，为高质量加速MRI重建提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

Result: 在Endo和MuReD数据集上，IBCA在多个指标上显著优于其他方法，如CR、OR和mAP。

Conclusion: IBCA能有效学习区分性注意力，提升医学图像多标签分类的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in

Conclusion: 通过状态空间模型和协同策略，论文显著提升了微表情分析的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

TL;DR: TBAC-UniImage提出了一种新型多模态理解与生成统一模型，通过深度整合预训练的扩散模型和多模态大语言模型（MLLM），解决了现有方法的浅层连接和高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型与MLLM结合的方法存在浅层连接或高计算成本的问题，限制了多模态理解与生成的深度统一。

Method: 利用MLLM的多层表示作为扩散模型的生成条件，而非仅依赖最终隐藏状态，实现了更深层次的统一。

Result: TBAC-UniImage实现了更细粒度的理解与生成统一。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态理解与生成提供了一种高效且深入的统一范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练和掩码的图像编辑框架Follow-Your-Shape，通过轨迹差异图（TDM）和计划KV注入机制实现精确的形状编辑，同时保留非目标内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式图像编辑模型在涉及大规模形状变换时表现不佳，容易改变非目标区域或无法实现预期形状变化。

Method: 通过比较反转和去噪路径的令牌速度差异计算轨迹差异图（TDM），并利用计划KV注入机制实现稳定编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在需要大规模形状替换的任务中表现出卓越的编辑能力和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape框架在精确形状编辑和内容保留方面优于现有方法，并通过ReShapeBench验证了其有效性。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景和风格下均优于现有技术，实现了更高的风格化质量和视觉真实感。

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过创新方法解决了3D风格迁移的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合任务特定和通用适配器（TUNA）的方法，用于类增量学习（CIL），通过熵选择机制和适配器融合策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练模型的CIL方法常冻结预训练网络并使用轻量模块（如适配器），但模块选择错误和忽视共享知识导致性能下降。

Method: 训练任务特定适配器捕获关键特征，引入熵选择机制；构建通用适配器编码跨任务共享特征；结合两者预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TUNA方法有效结合了任务特定和通用知识，提升了CIL性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仿真环境与真实世界差异大，导致仿真到现实的差距（sim2real gap），限制了自动驾驶模型的训练效果。

Method: 提出ReconDreamer-RL框架，包含ReconSimulator（结合视频扩散先验和物理建模）、动态对手代理（DAA）和表亲轨迹生成器（CTG）。

Result: 实验表明，ReconDreamer-RL在端到端自动驾驶训练中表现优异，碰撞率比模仿学习方法降低5倍。

Conclusion: ReconDreamer-RL有效缩小了sim2real差距，提升了自动驾驶模型的训练效果，尤其在极端场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Result: 在流体和大气模拟数据集上验证了CD-TVD的准确性和资源效率，显著提升了数据增强能力。

Conclusion: CD-TVD为大规模科学模拟提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

Conclusion: M$^3$方法有效利用深度数据，显著提升3D人体网格估计精度，代码将开源。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Conclusion: PP-Motion为人体运动生成提供了一种更全面、客观的评估标准。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

Conclusion: THAT通过改进高频特征表示和令牌选择，显著提升了高光谱图像融合的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM为手术室3D空间推理提供了高效解决方案，无需额外标注或传感器。

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D高斯场景分割方法存在计算成本高、空间推理能力有限和无法同时跟踪多目标的问题。

Method: 结合视频基础模型（如SAM2）进行视图一致的2D掩码传播，并使用GPU加速的3D掩码生成和高斯级实例标记算法。

Result: 在NVOS和Spin-NeRF基准测试中达到92.7%和95.2%的mIoU，推理速度比现有方法快15-1500倍（27毫秒/帧）。

Conclusion: SAGOnline为实时渲染和3D场景理解提供了高效解决方案，适用于AR/VR和机器人应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的方法，通过对比偏好损失和可学习偏好标记来预测用户偏好，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖通用偏好或静态用户画像，忽略了用户偏好的动态性和个体差异。

Method: 引入对比偏好损失和可学习偏好标记，从历史交互中学习个性化用户偏好。

Result: 模型在偏好预测准确性上优于其他方法，能有效识别相似审美倾向的用户。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精确地生成符合个人品味的图像，提升用户体验。

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

TL;DR: StableAvatar是一种端到端的视频扩散变换器，能够生成无限长度的高质量视频，解决了现有模型在音频同步和身份一致性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频且音频同步和身份一致性差。

Method: StableAvatar通过时间步感知音频适配器和音频原生引导机制，结合动态加权滑动窗口策略，优化音频建模和视频生成。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar为生成长视频提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了音频同步和视频流畅性。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: ReferSplat在R3DGS任务和3D开放词汇分割基准上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: R3DGS任务和ReferSplat框架为3D多模态理解提供了新方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物理约束的神经网络方法，用于从单张图像生成物理一致的4D场景动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从静态图像想象4D场景（包括运动和3D几何），现有方法通常使用简化的2D运动估计，导致违反物理原理的不真实动画。

Method: 提出了一种物理感知神经网络，预测每个表面点的运动，并通过基于Navier-Stokes方程的物理损失约束。同时，从输入图像和深度估计预测3D高斯特征，并渲染动画。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成物理上合理的动画，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功模拟了人类对4D场景的想象能力，为自然流体图像的动画生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

TL;DR: Omni是一个地理空间实体解析模型，通过全几何编码器处理多种几何形状，并结合预训练语言模型提升性能，比现有方法提升12%（F1）。LLMs在实验中表现出竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样几何形状时存在信息损失，缺乏统一的技术将异构几何嵌入神经网络框架。

Method: 提出Omni模型，包含全几何编码器和基于预训练语言模型的属性亲和机制。

Result: 在点数据集和多样几何数据集上测试，Omni比现有方法提升12%（F1）。LLMs表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Omni解决了多样几何形状的嵌入问题，性能显著提升；LLMs在地理空间实体解析中潜力巨大。

Abstract: The development, integration, and maintenance of geospatial databases rely
heavily on efficient and accurate matching procedures of Geospatial Entity
Resolution (ER). While resolution of points-of-interest (POIs) has been widely
addressed, resolution of entities with diverse geometries has been largely
overlooked. This is partly due to the lack of a uniform technique for embedding
heterogeneous geometries seamlessly into a neural network framework. Existing
neural approaches simplify complex geometries to a single point, resulting in
significant loss of spatial information. To address this limitation, we propose
Omni, a geospatial ER model featuring an omni-geometry encoder. This encoder is
capable of embedding point, line, polyline, polygon, and multi-polygon
geometries, enabling the model to capture the complex geospatial intricacies of
the places being compared. Furthermore, Omni leverages transformer-based
pre-trained language models over individual textual attributes of place records
in an Attribute Affinity mechanism. The model is rigorously tested on existing
point-only datasets and a new diverse-geometry geospatial ER dataset. Omni
produces up to 12% (F1) improvement over existing methods.
  Furthermore, we test the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct
geospatial ER, experimenting with prompting strategies and learning scenarios,
comparing the results of pre-trained language model-based methods with LLMs.
Results indicate that LLMs show competitive results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI增强的数据工作流带来了复杂的治理挑战，需要解决异构工具、动态执行模式和不透明模型决策的问题。

Method: TableVault通过记录数据摄取事件、追踪操作状态、链接执行参数到数据来源，并提供标准化元数据层来实现治理。

Result: 通过文档分类案例研究，TableVault展示了其在部分可观察环境中仍能保持详细的数据沿袭和操作上下文。

Conclusion: TableVault结合数据库保证和AI导向设计，为人机协作数据工作流提供了强大的元数据管理支持。

Abstract: AI-augmented data workflows introduce complex governance challenges, as both
human and model-driven processes generate, transform, and consume data
artifacts. These workflows blend heterogeneous tools, dynamic execution
patterns, and opaque model decisions, making comprehensive metadata capture
difficult. In this work, we present TableVault, a metadata governance framework
designed for human-AI collaborative data creation. TableVault records ingestion
events, traces operation status, links execution parameters to their data
origins, and exposes a standardized metadata layer. By combining
database-inspired guarantees with AI-oriented design, such as declarative
operation builders and lineage-aware references, TableVault supports
transparency and reproducibility across mixed human-model pipelines. Through a
document classification case study, we demonstrate how TableVault preserves
detailed lineage and operational context, enabling robust metadata management,
even in partially observable execution environments.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于加法同态加密（AHE）的隐私保护音乐嵌入向量相似性搜索方法，解决了传统加密和全同态加密（FHE）在性能和实用性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生成式AI时代，音乐数据的隐私保护面临独特挑战，传统方法如版权许可和数字水印对抽象数学表示的保护有限，需要更强的加密方法。

Method: 分析了音乐信息检索系统的威胁模型，提出了一种基于AHE的解决方案，通过音乐嵌入的内积实现隐私保护的相似性搜索。

Result: 通过实证评估和与FHE方案的比较，证明了所提方法的高效性和实用性。

Conclusion: AHE方法在保护音乐嵌入隐私的同时，提供了高效的相似性搜索能力，是一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of generative AI, ensuring the privacy of music data presents
unique challenges: unlike static artworks such as images, music data is
inherently temporal and multimodal, and it is sampled, transformed, and remixed
at an unprecedented scale. These characteristics make its core vector
embeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible
to being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the
original audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital
watermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical
representations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach
to safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as
AES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches
impossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible
solution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial
performance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity
searches. Given this trade-off, we propose a more practical approach using
Additive Homomorphic Encryption (AHE) for vector similarity search. The primary
contributions of this paper are threefold: we analyze threat models unique to
music information retrieval systems; we provide a theoretical analysis and
propose an efficient AHE-based solution through inner products of music
embeddings to deliver privacy-preserving similarity search; and finally, we
demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed approach through
empirical evaluation and comparison to FHE schemes on real-world MP3 files.

Motivation: 研究不同数据库模式间SQL查询映射的可行性和益处，以及其对文本到SQL系统性能的影响。

Method: 提出SQL-Exchange框架，通过结构对齐、执行有效性和语义正确性评估映射效果。

Result: SQL-Exchange在多种模式和查询类型中表现有效，映射查询作为上下文示例优于源模式查询。

Conclusion: SQL-Exchange显著提升文本到SQL系统的性能，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: We introduce SQL-Exchange, a framework for mapping SQL queries across
different database schemas by preserving the source query structure while
adapting domain-specific elements to align with the target schema. We
investigate the conditions under which such mappings are feasible and
beneficial, and examine their impact on enhancing the in-context learning
performance of text-to-SQL systems as a downstream task. Our comprehensive
evaluation across multiple model families and benchmark datasets--assessing
structural alignment with source queries, execution validity on target
databases, and semantic correctness--demonstrates that SQL-Exchange is
effective across a wide range of schemas and query types. Our results further
show that using mapped queries as in-context examples consistently improves
text-to-SQL performance over using queries from the source schema.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DQF的双层索引查询框架，通过动态搜索策略和决策树优化高频查询，显著提升了ANNS的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基ANNS方法假设查询分布均匀，但实际中查询频率不均，需针对性优化。

Method: 设计双层索引结构（热索引和全索引）及基于决策树的动态搜索策略，区分高频和低频查询。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，DQF比现有算法快2.0-5.7倍，保持95%召回率，且无需重建索引。

Conclusion: DQF在动态查询分布场景中高效实用，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a crucial operation in
databases and artificial intelligence. Current graph-based ANNS methods, such
as HNSW and NSG, have shown remarkable performance but are designed under the
assumption of a uniform query distribution. However, in practical scenarios,
user preferences and query temporal dynamics lead to some queries being
searched for more frequently than others. To fully utilize these
characteristics, we propose DQF, a novel Dual-Index Query Framework. This
framework comprises a dual-layer index structure and a dynamic search strategy
based on a decision tree. The dual-layer index structure comprises a hot index
for high-frequency nodes and a full index for the entire dataset, allowing for
the separate management of hot and cold queries. Furthermore, we propose a
dynamic search strategy that employs a decision tree to adapt to the specific
characteristics of each query. The decision tree evaluates whether a query is
of the high-frequency type to detect the opportunities for early termination on
the dual-layer, avoiding unnecessary searches in the full index. Experimental
results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the Dual-Index Query
Framework achieves a significant speedup of 2.0-5.7x over state-of-the-art
algorithms while maintaining a 95% recall rate. Importantly, it does not
require full index reconstruction when query distributions change, underscoring
its efficiency and practicality in dynamic query distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: RNA-KG v2.0为RNA研究提供了更全面的数据支持，增强了上下文感知分析能力。

Abstract: RNA-KG is a recently developed knowledge graph that integrates the
interactions involving coding and non-coding RNA molecules extracted from
public data sources. It can be used to support the classification of new
molecules, identify new interactions through the use of link prediction
methods, and reveal hidden patterns among the represented entities. In this
paper, we propose RNA-KG v2.0, a new release of RNA-KG that integrates around
100M manually curated interactions sourced from 91 linked open data
repositories and ontologies. Relationships are characterized by standardized
properties that capture the specific context (e.g., cell line, tissue,
pathological state) in which they have been identified. In addition, the nodes
are enriched with detailed attributes, such as descriptions, synonyms, and
molecular sequences sourced from platforms such as OBO ontologies, NCBI
repositories, RNAcentral, and Ensembl. The enhanced repository enables the
expression of advanced queries that take into account the context in which the
experiments were conducted. It also supports downstream applications in RNA
research, including "context-aware" link prediction techniques that combine
both topological and semantic information.

Result: 实验显示存储引擎设计和变长数据处理方式导致显著性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新基准测试方法，强调需要更真实的基准测试以反映动态工作负载，为实践和研究提供指导。

Abstract: The performance of database management systems (DBMS) is traditionally
evaluated using benchmarks that focus on workloads with (almost) fixed record
lengths. However, some real-world workloads in key/value stores, document
databases, and graph databases exhibit significant variability in value
lengths, which can lead to performance anomalies, particularly when popular
records grow disproportionately large. Existing benchmarks fail to account for
this variability, leaving an important aspect of DBMS behavior underexplored.
  In this paper, we address this gap by extending the Yahoo! Cloud Serving
Benchmark (YCSB) to include an "extend" operation, which appends data to record
fields, simulating the growth of values over time. Using this modified
benchmark, we have measured the performance of three popular DBMS backends:
MongoDB, MariaDB with the InnoDB storage engine, and MariaDB with the MyRocks
storage engine. Our experiments alternate between extending values and
executing query workloads, revealing significant performance differences driven
by storage engine design and their handling of variable-sized values.
  Our key contribution is the introduction of a novel benchmarking approach to
evaluate the impact of growing value sizes and isolate the effect of querying
data with a distribution of data sizes from any cost associated with accessing
data after a history of updates. This highlights the need for more
representative benchmarks that capture the dynamic nature of real-world
workloads, providing valuable guidance for both practitioners and researchers.

Result: 实验表明，MLego显著降低计算成本，同时保持高质量的主题建模结果。

Conclusion: MLego填补了可扩展主题建模与交互式数据分析之间的空白，提升了现有可视化分析方法。

Abstract: With massive texts on social media, users and analysts often rely on topic
modeling techniques to quickly extract key themes and gain insights.
Traditional topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA), provide valuable insights but are computationally expensive, making them
impractical for real-time data analysis. Although recent advances in
distributed training and fast sampling methods have improved efficiency,
real-time topic exploration remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
present MLego, an interactive query framework designed to support real-time
topic modeling analysis by leveraging model materialization and reuse. Instead
of retraining models from scratch, MLego efficiently merges materialized topic
models to construct approximate results at interactive speeds. To further
enhance efficiency, we introduce a hierarchical plan search strategy for single
queries and an optimized query reordering technique for batch queries. We
integrate MLego into a visual analytics prototype system, enabling users to
explore large-scale textual datasets through interactive queries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MLego significantly reduces computation costs
while maintaining high-quality topic modeling results. MLego enhances existing
visual analytics approaches, which primarily focus on user-driven topic
modeling, by enabling real-time, query-driven exploration. This complements
traditional methods and bridges the gap between scalable topic modeling and
interactive data analysis.

Abstract: Efficient and effective data discovery is critical for many modern
applications in machine learning and data science. One major bottleneck to the
development of a general-purpose data discovery tool is the absence of an
expressive formal language, and corresponding implementation, for
characterizing and solving generic discovery queries. To this end, we present
TQL, a domain-specific language for data discovery well-designed to leverage

and semantics. In this paper, we fully and formally characterize the core
language through an algebraic model, Imperative Relational Algebra with Types
(ImpRAT), and implement a modular proof-of-concept system prototype.

Abstract: Entity matching (EM) is a fundamental task in data integration and analytics,
essential for identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity
across diverse sources. In practice, datasets often differ widely in structure,
format, schema, and semantics, creating substantial challenges for EM. We refer
to this setting as Heterogeneous EM (HEM). This survey offers a unified
perspective on HEM by introducing a taxonomy, grounded in prior work, that
distinguishes two primary categories -- representation and semantic
heterogeneity -- and their subtypes. The taxonomy provides a systematic lens
for understanding how variations in data form and meaning shape the complexity
of matching tasks. We then connect this framework to the FAIR principles --
Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability -- demonstrating
how they both reveal the challenges of HEM and suggest strategies for
mitigating them. Building on this foundation, we critically review recent EM
methods, examining their ability to address different heterogeneity types, and
conduct targeted experiments on state-of-the-art models to evaluate their
robustness and adaptability under semantic heterogeneity. Our analysis uncovers
persistent limitations in current approaches and points to promising directions
for future research, including multimodal matching, human-in-the-loop
workflows, deeper integration with large language models and knowledge graphs,
and fairness-aware evaluation in heterogeneous settings.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu,Ben Lengerich,Ying Nian Wu,Xuhong Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PiKV是一个专为MoE架构设计的并行分布式KV缓存框架，通过专家分片存储、路由优化和调度策略减少内存和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模和上下文长度的增加，KV缓存的存储和通信成本成为多GPU和多节点推理的主要瓶颈。MoE架构虽然稀疏化了计算，但KV缓存仍密集且全局同步，导致显著开销。

Method: PiKV采用专家分片KV存储、PiKV路由减少访问、PiKV调度保留相关条目，并集成压缩模块优化内存使用。

Result: PiKV已开源，实验结果显示其能有效减少KV缓存的开销，并与Nvidia kvpress集成加速。

Conclusion: PiKV是一个持续发展的项目，目标是成为MoE架构的全面KV缓存管理系统。

Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up in both size and context
length, the memory and communication cost of key-value (KV) cache storage has
become a major bottleneck in multi-GPU and multi-node inference. While
MoE-based architectures sparsify computation across experts, the corresponding
KV caches remain dense and globally synchronized, resulting in significant
overhead.
  We introduce \textbf{PiKV}, a parallel and distributed KV cache serving
framework tailored for MoE architecture. PiKV leverages \textit{expert-sharded
KV storage} to partition caches across GPUs, \textit{PiKV routing} to reduce
token-to-KV access, and a \textit{PiKV Scheduling} to adaptively retain
query-relevant entries. To further reduce memory usage, PiKV integrates
\textit{PiKV Compression} modules the caching pipeline for acceleration.
  PiKV is recently publicly available as an open-source software library:
\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV}.
Experiments details is recorded at:
\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/blob/main/downstream_tasks/README.md}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKV/Experimental\_Results}.
We also have PiKV integrated with Nvidia kvpress for acceleration, details see
\href{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}{https://github.com/NoakLiu/PiKVpress}.
PiKV is still a living project, aiming to become a comprehesive KV Cache
management system for MoE Architectures.

### [394] [Kairos: Low-latency Multi-Agent Serving with Shared LLMs and Excessive Loads in the Public Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06948)
*Jinyuan Chen,Jiuchen Shi,Quan Chen,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Kairos是一个多智能体编排系统，通过优化请求调度和资源分配，显著降低多智能体应用的端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多智能体应用中因忽视智能体间延迟和资源差异，导致服务性能低下。

Method: Kairos由工作流编排器、优先级调度器和内存感知调度器组成，分别负责在线工作流分析、基于延迟特性的请求优先级调度和基于内存需求的请求分发。

Result: 实验表明，Kairos比现有最优方法降低端到端延迟17.8%至28.4%。

Conclusion: Kairos通过智能调度和资源管理，有效提升了多智能体应用的性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent applications utilize the advanced capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) for intricate task completion through agent collaboration in a
workflow. Under this situation, requests from different agents usually access
the same shared LLM to perform different kinds of tasks, forcing the shared LLM
to suffer excessive loads. However, existing works have low serving performance
for these multi-agent applications, mainly due to the ignorance of inter-agent
latency and resource differences for request scheduling. We therefore propose
Kairos, a multi-agent orchestration system that optimizes end-to-end latency
for multi-agent applications. Kairos consists of a workflow orchestrator, a
workflow-aware priority scheduler, and a memory-aware dispatcher. The
orchestrator collects agent-specific information for online workflow analysis.
The scheduler decides the serving priority of the requests based on their
latency characteristics to reduce the overall queuing. The dispatcher
dispatches the requests to different LLM instances based on their memory
demands to avoid GPU overloading. Experimental results show that Kairos reduces
end-to-end latency by 17.8% to 28.4% compared to state-of-the-art works.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种理论，用于设计无需同步的多处理器算法，并通过局部状态转移图的部分序性质简化收敛性证明，显著降低了复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多处理器系统的普及，开发快速并行处理算法的需求增加，但同步机制成本高昂。研究旨在设计无需同步的算法，充分利用计算资源。

Method: 提出了一种理论，通过分析局部状态转移图的部分序性质，证明算法在异步环境下的收敛性，避免了生成全局状态空间的高复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，设计的算法在收敛时间上显著优于现有算法，且异步执行效率与调度执行相当。

Conclusion: 该理论为异步环境下的算法设计提供了高效且低复杂度的证明方法，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: We currently see a steady rise in the usage and size of multiprocessor
systems, and so the community is evermore interested in developing fast
parallel processing algorithms. However, most algorithms require a
synchronization mechanism, which is costly in terms of computational resources
and time. If an algorithm can be executed in asynchrony, then it can use all
the available computation power, and the nodes can execute without being
scheduled or locked. However, to show that an algorithm guarantees convergence
in asynchrony, we need to generate the entire global state transition graph and
check for the absence of cycles. This takes time exponential in the size of the
global state space. In this dissertation, we present a theory that explains the
necessary and sufficient properties of a multiprocessor algorithm that
guarantees convergence even without synchronization. We develop algorithms for
various problems that do not require synchronization. Additionally, we show for
several existing algorithms that they can be executed without any
synchronization mechanism. A significant theoretical benefit of our work is in
proving that an algorithm can converge even in asynchrony. Our theory implies
that we can make such conclusions about an algorithm, by only showing that the
local state transition graph of a computing node forms a partial order, rather
than generating the entire global state space and determining the absence of
cycles in it. Thus, the complexity of rendering such proofs, formal or social,
is phenomenally reduced. Experiments show a significant reduction in time taken
to converge, when we compare the execution time of algorithms in the literature
versus the algorithms that we design. We get similar results when we run an
algorithm, that guarantees convergence in asynchrony, under a scheduler versus
in asynchrony.

*Oscar Amoros,Albert Andaluz,Johnny Nunez,Antonio J. Pena*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出一种自动实现GPU内核水平与垂直融合的新方法，提升资源利用率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GPU库在链式调用多个内核时难以充分利用并行资源和SRAM，且依赖手动开发融合内核，限制了应用场景。

Method: 利用C++17元编程技术，动态生成优化的融合内核，无需手动开发或预编译。

Result: 在多种基准测试中性能提升2x至1000x以上，同时保持高可编程性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升GPU性能，简化开发流程，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: Existing GPU libraries often struggle to fully exploit the parallel resources
and on-chip memory (SRAM) of GPUs when chaining multiple GPU functions as
individual kernels. While Kernel Fusion (KF) techniques like Horizontal Fusion
(HF) and Vertical Fusion (VF) can mitigate this, current library
implementations often require library developers to manually create fused
kernels. Hence, library users rely on limited sets of pre-compiled or
template-based fused kernels. This limits the use cases that can benefit from
HF and VF and increases development costs. In order to solve these issues, we
present a novel methodology for building GPU libraries that enables automatic
on-demand HF and VF for arbitrary combinations of GPU library functions. Our
methodology defines reusable, fusionable components that users combine via
high-level programming interfaces. Leveraging C++17 metaprogramming features
available in compilers like nvcc, our methodology generates a single and
optimized fused kernel tailored to the user's specific sequence of operations
at compile time, without needing a custom compiler or manual development and
pre-compilation of kernel combinations. This approach abstracts low-level GPU
complexities while maximizing GPU resource utilization and keeping intermediate
data in SRAM. We provide an open-source implementation demonstrating
significant speedups compared to traditional libraries in various benchmarks,
validating the effectiveness of this methodology for improving GPU performance
in the range of 2x to more than 1000x, while preserving high-level
programmability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在灾害区域等动态环境中收集的数据量庞大，需要实时卸载到边缘和云端处理，因此需要高效的数据存储和查询系统。

Method: AerialDB采用轻量级技术实现内容驱动的副本放置和分片索引，支持时空查询，并通过容器化部署在400架无人机和80个边缘服务器上验证。

Conclusion: AerialDB是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于无人机系统的实时数据处理，尤其在灾害管理等场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent years have seen an unprecedented growth in research that leverages the
newest computing paradigm of Internet of Drones, comprising a fleet of
connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for a wide range of tasks such
as monitoring and analytics in highly mobile and changing environments
characteristic of disaster regions. Given that the typical data (i.e., videos
and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be
considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need
to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further
processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight
decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time
series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs
fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected
through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based
replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for
efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and
temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications.
Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we
demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near
real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB
comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which
provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively
low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits
comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance
against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100
times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the
cloud baseline.

TL;DR: FlashMP是一种新型预条件系统，通过离散变换设计子域精确求解器，显著提升大规模线性系统的求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代求解器在处理双旋度算子时收敛缓慢，而直接求解器因内存需求过高不实用。

Method: 设计基于离散变换的子域精确求解器，并实现高效的多GPU可扩展性。

Result: 在AMD MI60 GPU集群上，FlashMP将迭代次数减少16倍，速度提升2.5至4.9倍，并行效率达84.1%。

Conclusion: FlashMP为解决电磁模拟中的大规模线性系统提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently solving large-scale linear systems is a critical challenge in
electromagnetic simulations, particularly when using the Crank-Nicolson
Finite-Difference Time-Domain (CN-FDTD) method. Existing iterative solvers are
commonly employed to handle the resulting sparse systems but suffer from slow
convergence due to the ill-conditioned nature of the double-curl operator.
Approximate preconditioners, like Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and
Incomplete LU decomposition (ILU), provide insufficient convergence, while
direct solvers are impractical due to excessive memory requirements. To address
this, we propose FlashMP, a novel preconditioning system that designs a
subdomain exact solver based on discrete transforms. FlashMP provides an
efficient GPU implementation that achieves multi-GPU scalability through domain
decomposition. Evaluations on AMD MI60 GPU clusters (up to 1000 GPUs) show that
FlashMP reduces iteration counts by up to 16x and achieves speedups of 2.5x to
4.9x compared to baseline implementations in state-of-the-art libraries such as
Hypre. Weak scalability tests show parallel efficiencies up to 84.1%.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了现代通用PiM架构（如UPMEM PiM系统）在加速神经网络训练和推理中的潜力，展示了其在性能上的显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算机架构中，内存密集型任务（如机器学习、图处理、数据库）的性能受限于数据移动瓶颈。处理内存（PiM）是一种新兴计算范式，旨在通过将计算移至数据所在的内存单元附近或内部来缓解这一瓶颈。

Method: 研究选择了UPMEM PiM系统，这是首个商用通用PiM架构，并比较了其在多层感知器（MLP）实现上与Intel Xeon CPU的性能差异。此外，还评估了使用UPMEM的工作SRAM（WRAM）实现的小型MLP与低功耗Nvidia Jetson GPU的性能。

Result: UPMEM PiM在大型批量推理中性能比CPU快259倍。使用WRAM的MLP推理内核执行时间低于3毫秒，与低功耗GPU处于同一数量级。

Conclusion: 现代通用PiM架构（如UPMEM）在神经网络推理中表现出显著性能优势，尤其是在处理大规模数据时，为缓解数据移动瓶颈提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In modern computer architectures, the performance of many memory-bound
workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph processing, databases) is limited by
the data movement bottleneck that emerges when transferring large amounts of
data between the main memory and the central processing unit (CPU).
Processing-in-memory is an emerging computing paradigm that aims to alleviate
this data movement bottleneck by performing computation close to or within the
memory units, where data resides. One example of a prevalent workload whose
performance is bound by the data movement bottleneck is the training and
inference process of artificial neural networks. In this work, we analyze the
potential of modern general-purpose PiM architectures to accelerate neural
networks. To this end, we selected the UPMEM PiM system, the first commercially
available real-world general-purpose PiM architecture. We compared the
implementation of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in PiM with a sequential
baseline running on an Intel Xeon CPU. The UPMEM implementation achieves up to
$259\times$ better performance for inference of large batch sizes when compared
against the CPU that exploits the size of the available PiM memory.
Additionally, two smaller MLPs were implemented using UPMEM's working SRAM
(WRAM), a scratchpad memory, to evaluate their performance against a low-power
Nvidia Jetson graphics processing unit (GPU), providing further insights into
the efficiency of UPMEM's PiM for neural network inference. Results show that
using WRAM achieves kernel execution times for MLP inference of under $3$ ms,
which is within the same order of magnitude as low-power GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链分片技术通过并行处理交易来提高效率，但动态调度问题尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出高效的调度算法。

Method: 使用分片图模型，将分片分为集群，每个集群由领导者分片调度交易。研究了无状态和有状态两种模型，分别分析了延迟的竞争比。

Result: 无状态模型的延迟竞争比为O(d log²s · min{k, √s})，有状态模型为O(log s · min{k, √s} + log²s)。同时证明了近似最优调度的NP难度。

Conclusion: 本文首次为区块链分片系统提供了可证明高效的动态调度算法，其性能接近理论最优。

Abstract: Sharding is a technique to speed up transaction processing in blockchains,
where the $n$ processing nodes in the blockchain are divided into $s$ disjoint
groups (shards) that can process transactions in parallel. We study dynamic
scheduling problems on a shard graph $G_s$ where transactions arrive online
over time and are not known in advance. Each transaction may access at most $k$
shards, and we denote by $d$ the worst distance between a transaction and its
accessing (destination) shards (the parameter $d$ is unknown to the shards). To
handle different values of $d$, we assume a locality sensitive decomposition of
$G_s$ into clusters of shards, where every cluster has a leader shard that
schedules transactions for the cluster. We first examine the simpler case of
the stateless model, where leaders are not aware of the current state of the
transaction accounts, and we prove a $O(d \log^2 s \cdot \min\{k, \sqrt{s}\})$
competitive ratio for latency. We then consider the stateful model, where
leader shards gather the current state of accounts, and we prove a $O(\log
s\cdot \min\{k, \sqrt{s}\}+\log^2 s)$ competitive ratio for latency. Each
leader calculates the schedule in polynomial time for each transaction that it
processes. We show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, approximating the optimal
schedule within a $(\min\{k, \sqrt{s}\})^{1 -\epsilon}$ factor is NP-hard.
Hence, our bound for the stateful model is within a poly-log factor from the
best possibly achievable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
to establish provably efficient dynamic scheduling algorithms for blockchain
sharding systems.

Result: 在配备A100和A30 GPU的异构系统中，OPEN的预测准确率达到98.29%。

Abstract: Performance prediction is essential for energy-efficient computing in
heterogeneous computing systems that integrate CPUs and GPUs. However,
traditional performance modeling methods often rely on exhaustive offline
profiling, which becomes impractical due to the large setting space and the
high cost of profiling large-scale applications. In this paper, we present
OPEN, a framework consists of offline and online phases. The offline phase
involves building a performance predictor and constructing an initial dense
matrix. In the online phase, OPEN performs lightweight online profiling, and
leverages the performance predictor with collaborative filtering to make
performance prediction. We evaluate OPEN on multiple heterogeneous systems,
including those equipped with A100 and A30 GPUs. Results show that OPEN
achieves prediction accuracy up to 98.29\%. This demonstrates that OPEN
effectively reduces profiling cost while maintaining high accuracy, making it
practical for power-aware performance modeling in modern HPC environments.
Overall, OPEN provides a lightweight solution for performance prediction under
power constraints, enabling better runtime decisions in power-aware computing
environments.

Conclusion: 提出的预测性调度框架有效解决了无服务器计算的冷启动问题，显著提升了性能和资源效率。

Abstract: Serverless computing has transformed cloud application deployment by
introducing a fine-grained, event-driven execution model that abstracts away
infrastructure management. Its on-demand nature makes it especially appealing
for latency-sensitive and bursty workloads. However, the cold start problem,
i.e., where the platform incurs significant delay when provisioning new
containers, remains the Achilles' heel of such platforms.
  This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on
Model Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving
end-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller
jointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving
latency while minimizing resource overhead.
  We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based
testbed. Experimental results using real-world function traces and synthetic
workloads demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 85% lower tail latency and a 34%
reduction in resource usage.

Motivation: 探索在存在恶意节点（BBH）的未知图中，移动代理如何持续完成任务，填补了无初始拓扑知识下黑洞问题研究的空白。

Method: 定义了两种变体问题（PerpExpl和PerpExplHome），在同步调度器和面对面通信模型下，研究无环和一般图中所需的最少代理数量。

Result: 在无环网络中，PerpExpl需要4个代理，PerpExplHome需要6个代理；一般图中，PerpExpl的下界为2Δ-1，PerpExplHome的上界为3Δ+3。

Conclusion: 首次研究了无初始拓扑知识下任意网络中的黑洞变体问题，为相关领域提供了理论基础和算法支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate: ``How can a group of initially co-located
mobile agents perpetually explore an unknown graph, when one stationary node
occasionally behaves maliciously, under an adversary's control?'' We call this
node a ``Byzantine black hole (BBH)'' and at any given round it may choose to
destroy all visiting agents, or none. This subtle power can drastically
undermine classical exploration strategies designed for an always active black
hole. We study this perpetual exploration problem in the presence of at most
one BBH, without initial knowledge of the network size. Since the underlying
graph may be 1-connected, perpetual exploration of the entire graph may be
infeasible. We thus define two variants: \pbmPerpExpl\ and \pbmPerpExplHome. In
the former, the agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of at least
one component, obtained after the exclusion of the BBH. In the latter, the
agents are tasked to perform perpetual exploration of the component which
contains the \emph{home} node, where agents are initially co-located.
Naturally, \pbmPerpExplHome\ is a special case of \pbmPerpExpl. Agents operate
under a synchronous scheduler and communicate in a face-to-face model. Our goal
is to determine the minimum number of agents necessary and sufficient to solve
these problems. In acyclic networks, we obtain optimal algorithms that solve
\pbmPerpExpl\ with $4$ agents, and \pbmPerpExplHome\ with $6$ agents in trees.
The lower bounds hold even in path graphs. In general graphs, we give a
non-trivial lower bound of $2\Delta-1$ agents for \pbmPerpExpl, and an upper
bound of $3\Delta+3$ agents for \pbmPerpExplHome. To our knowledge, this is the
first study of a black-hole variant in arbitrary networks without initial
topological knowledge.

Conclusion: 顶层代理是简化6G网络服务部署的有效方案，适用于多提供商协作场景。

Abstract: 6G network architectures will usher in a wave of innovative services and
capabilities, introducing concepts like split computing and dynamic processing
nodes. This implicates a paradigm where accessing resources seamlessly aligns
with diverse processing node characteristics, ensuring a uniform interface. In
this landscape, the identity of the operator becomes inconsequential, paving
the way for a collaborative ecosystem where multiple providers contribute to a
shared pool of resources. At the core of this vision is the guarantee of
specific performance parameters, precisely tailored to the location and service
requirements. A consistent layer, as the abstraction of the complexities of
different infrastructure providers, is needed to simplify service deployment.
One promising approach is the introduction of an over-the-top broker for
resource allocation, which streamlines the integration of these services into
the network and cloud infrastructure of the future. This paper explores the
role of the broker in two split computing scenarios. By abstracting the
complexities of various infrastructures, the broker proves to be a versatile
solution applicable not only to cloud environments but also to networks and
beyond. Additionally, a detailed discussion of a proof-of-concept
implementation provides insights into the broker's actual architectural
framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代硬件环境日益异构，现有锁解决方案通常针对特定硬件设计，未能充分利用异构环境中的资源。

Method: 提出锁模块化方法，将锁分解为独立模块并分配到合适的硬件组件上。

Result: 该方法能够根据硬件特性分配锁模块，最大化资源利用并减少性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 锁模块化是一种有效的设计原则，适用于异构硬件环境中的锁管理。

Abstract: Modern hardware environments are becoming increasingly heterogeneous, leading
to the emergence of applications specifically designed to exploit this
heterogeneity. Efficiently adopting locks in these applications poses distinct
challenges. The uneven distribution of resources in such environments can
create bottlenecks for lock operations, severely hindering application
performance. Existing solutions are often tailored to specific types of
hardware, which underutilizes resources on other components within
heterogeneous environments.
  This paper introduces a new design principle: decomposing locks across
hardware components to fully utilize unevenly distributed resources in
heterogeneous environments. Following this principle, we propose lock
modularization, a systematic approach that decomposes a lock into independent
modules and assigns them to appropriate hardware components. This approach
aligns the resource requirements of lock modules with the attributes of
specific hardware components, maximizing strengths while minimizing weaknesses.

Abstract: Messaging systems are essential for efficiently transferring large volumes of
data, ensuring rapid response times and high-throughput communication. The
state-of-the-art on messaging systems mainly focuses on the performance
evaluation of brokered messaging systems, which use an intermediate broker to
guarantee reliability and quality of service. However, over the past decade,
brokerless messaging systems have emerged, eliminating the single point of
failure and trading off reliability guarantees for higher performance. Still,
the state-of-the-art on evaluating the performance of brokerless systems is
scarce. In this work, we solely focus on brokerless messaging systems. First,
we perform a qualitative analysis of several possible candidates, to find the
most promising ones. We then design and implement an extensive open-source
benchmarking suite to systematically and fairly evaluate the performance of the
chosen libraries, namely, ZeroMQ, NanoMsg, and NanoMsg-Next-Generation (NNG).
We evaluate these libraries considering different metrics and workload
conditions, and provide useful insights into their limitations. Our analysis
enables practitioners to select the most suitable library for their
requirements.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦学习（FL）的实时电力消耗监测方法，通过优化FL训练解决非独立同分布数据和计算成本问题，展示了指数加权损失的优点，并在大规模客户数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过物联网（IoT）实时监测城市和微电网的电力消耗有助于预测未来需求和优化电网运营，但将用户级数据上传至云端可能暴露活动模式。联邦学习（FL）作为一种隐私敏感的协作训练方法，能够保留数据在边缘设备上，但面临非独立同分布数据和大规模客户的计算挑战。

Result: 提出的方法在预测准确性上优于基线模型（如ARIMA和针对单个消费者的DNN），同时显著降低了训练成本，展示了其在大规模应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过优化FL训练，论文成功实现了高精度的电力需求预测，同时解决了隐私和计算成本问题，为城市和微电网的实时监测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of power consumption in cities and micro-grids through
the Internet of Things (IoT) can help forecast future demand and optimize grid
operations. But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for
predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns.
Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training
approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data
locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges
exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID)
data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to
1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several
optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand
forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a
high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the
benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it
further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these
strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from
the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and
a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods
over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are
not scalable.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在金融技术（如CBDCs）中软件质量认证的挑战，并提倡使用形式化方法确保系统正确性，尤其是离线支付。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算机能力强大，但软件质量认证在理论上存在不可行性，而金融技术中的小错误可能导致严重后果，因此需要可靠方法。

Method: 提出使用形式化方法来验证CBDCs软件基础设施的操作弹性，特别是针对离线支付。

Result: 形式化方法可以为计算系统的正确性提供断言，尽管无法完全克服理论上的局限性。

Conclusion: 在CBDCs等金融技术中，形式化方法是确保软件基础设施可靠性的关键工具，尤其是针对离线支付场景。

Abstract: Information and communication technologies are by now employed in most
activities, including economics and finance. Despite the extraordinary power of
modern computers and the vast amount of memory, some results of theoretical
computer science imply the impossibility of certifying software quality in
general. With the exception of safety-critical systems, this has primarily
concerned the information processed by confined systems, with limited
socio-economic consequences. In the emerging era of technologies for exchanging
digital money and tokenized assets over the Internet - such as central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs) - even a minor bug could trigger a financial
collapse. Although the aforementioned impossibility results cannot be overcome
in an absolute sense, there exist formal methods that can provide assertions of
computing systems correctness. We advocate their use to validate the
operational resilience of software infrastructures enabling CBDCs, with special
emphasis on offline payments as they constitute a very critical issue.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 开发了Iris RESTful Server，支持高性能的WSI文件流式传输，兼容DICOMweb WADO-RS API，并集成到OpenSeaDragon中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态HTTP服务器无法流式传输高分辨率WSI文件的问题，提升病理学家的图像渲染体验和系统管理效率。

Method: 使用C++和Boost Beast HTTP/Asio库开发RESTful服务器，兼容DICOMweb WADO-RS API，并扩展OpenSeaDragon以支持新API。

Result: 单实例每秒可处理5000个瓦片请求，延迟中位数为21毫秒，并提供了开发工具和部署指南。

Conclusion: Iris RESTful Server为WSI工作流提供了高效、安全的解决方案，并简化了现有系统的集成。

Abstract: The Iris File Extension (IFE) is a low overhead performance-oriented whole
slide image (WSI) file format designed to improve the image rendering
experience for pathologists and simplify image management for system
administrators. However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers
cannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the
IFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as
browser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based
rendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI)
for compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. In order to address
this limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP
server with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS
API. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop
the public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance.
Testing shows that a single instance can handle over 5000 tile requests per
second with a median latency of 21 ms on a private network. We also developed
and merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful
API, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in
replacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure
cross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed
deployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and the public
examples.restful.irisdigitialpathology.org subdomain is provided as a
development tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G网络的异构性和动态性增强，需要更高效的自动化管理方法。意图驱动网络（IDN）通过将高层意图转化为优化策略来解决这一问题，而大语言模型（LLM）可以进一步提升这一过程的智能化和适应性。

Method: 提出了一种分层学习驱动的IDN架构，将生成式AI（GenAI）应用于意图处理、验证和执行三个阶段，并通过基于最新GenAI架构Mamba的案例研究验证其有效性。

Result: 案例研究表明，提出的GenAI驱动的IDN架构通过智能自动化显著提升了网络性能，优于传统IDN架构。

Conclusion: 本文为6G网络中基于LLM的IDN架构提供了全面综述，并通过分层框架展示了GenAI在多阶段应用的潜力，为未来网络自动化管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the emergence of 6G, mobile networks are becoming increasingly
heterogeneous and dynamic, necessitating advanced automation for efficient
management. Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating
high-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can
enhance this process by understanding complex human instructions to enable
adaptive, intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI
(GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated
Radio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This
article provides such a survey, along with a case study on a hierarchical
learning-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key
stages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. Unlike most
existing approaches that apply GenAI in the form of LLMs for intent processing
only, we propose a hierarchical framework that introduces GenAI across all
three stages of IDN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDN
management architecture, we present a case study based on the latest GenAI
architecture named Mamba. The case study shows how the proposed GenAI-driven
architecture enhances network performance through intelligent automation,
surpassing the performance of the conventional IDN architectures.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提路由策略优于现有方法，接近理论上限，并展示了在系统参数设计和无人机网络中的应用。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和策略为THz通信系统提供了高效、可扩展的性能评估和优化工具。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication offers a promising solution for high-throughput
wireless systems. However, the severe path loss of THz signals raises concerns
about its effectiveness compared to radio frequency (RF) communication. In this
article, we establish the first stochastic geometry (SG)-based analytical
framework for routing in THz systems. We develop a stepwise optimization
approach to maximize throughput, including power allocation, relay selection,
and number of hops design. Analytical expressions for throughput and coverage
probability are derived under the SG framework, enabling low complexity and
scalable performance evaluation. Numerical results show that the proposed
stepwise-optimal routing strategies not only outperform existing SG-based
methods but also approach the ideal upper bound. Moreover, we compare the
throughput and coverage performance of THz and RF routing and demonstrate the
applications of the proposed analytical framework and routing strategies in
system parameter design and unmanned aerial vehicle networks.

Motivation: 现有基于集中训练和分散执行（CTDE）的MARL方法在现实应用中存在集中训练依赖和信息收集开销大的问题。

Method: 采用完全去中心化的MARL架构，基于共识的信息交换，设计基于actor-critic网络的算法，仅交换局部奖励以减少通信开销。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提算法显著优于其他基线方法，提升了RA网络性能。

Conclusion: 完全去中心化的MARL架构在优化RA性能方面具有实际应用潜力，且理论证明了全局收敛性。

Abstract: With wireless devices increasingly forming a unified smart network for
seamless, user-friendly operations, random access (RA) medium access control
(MAC) design is considered a key solution for handling unpredictable data
traffic from multiple terminals. However, it remains challenging to design an
effective RA-based MAC protocol to minimize collisions and ensure transmission
fairness across the devices. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) approaches with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE)
have been proposed to optimize RA performance, their reliance on centralized
training and the significant overhead required for information collection can
make real-world applications unrealistic. In this work, we adopt a fully
decentralized MARL architecture, where policy learning does not rely on
centralized tasks but leverages consensus-based information exchanges across
devices. We design our MARL algorithm over an actor-critic (AC) network and
propose exchanging only local rewards to minimize communication overhead.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof of global convergence for our
approach. Numerical experiments show that our proposed MARL algorithm can
significantly improve RA network performance compared to other baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IPv6的普及，了解其对互联网审查的影响变得重要，但目前研究主要集中在IPv4上。

Method: 通过全球范围内的HTTP、DNS和TLS协议测量，比较IPv4和IPv6的审查差异。

Result: 发现IPv6审查能力不如IPv4全面和可靠，存在新的规避审查机会。

Conclusion: IPv6为规避审查提供了新途径，未来需要开发利用IPv6技术的工具。

Abstract: Internet censorship continues to impact billions of people worldwide, and
measurement of it remains an important focus of research. However, most
Internet censorship measurements have focused solely on the IPv4 Internet
infrastructure. Yet, more clients and servers are available over IPv6:
According to Google, over a third of their users now have native IPv6 access.
Given the slow-but-steady rate of IPv6 adoption, it is important to understand
its impact on censorship. In this paper, we measure and analyze how censorship
differs over IPv6 compared to the well-studied IPv4 censorship systems in use
today. We perform a comprehensive global study of censorship across an array of
commonly censored protocols, including HTTP, DNS, and TLS, on both IPv4 and
IPv6, and compare the results. We find that there are several differences in
how countries censor IPv6 traffic, both in terms of IPv6 resources, and in
where and what blocklists or technologies are deployed on IPv6 networks. Many
of these differences are not all-or-nothing: we find that most censors have
some capacity to block in IPv6, but are less comprehensive or less reliable
compared to their IPv4 censorship systems. Our results suggest that IPv6 offers
new areas for censorship circumvention researchers to explore, providing
potentially new ways to evade censors. As more users gain access to IPv6
addresses and networks, there will be a need for tools that take advantage of
IPv6 techniques and infrastructure to bypass censorship.

Motivation: 随着IPv6的普及，尚不清楚其审查系统是否与IPv4同样有效，因此需要研究IPv6的DNS审查情况。

Method: 利用新技术发现IPv6开放解析器，发送2000多万次DNS请求，测量解析器、网络和国家层面的屏蔽率及被屏蔽域名特征。

Result: 几乎所有审查者都支持IPv6屏蔽，但政策不一致且效果不如IPv4，IPv6审查资源投入不足。

Conclusion: IPv6审查效果较差，为规避审查提供了新机会，审查者需投入更多资源以匹配IPv4的审查水平。

Abstract: Internet censorship impacts large segments of the Internet, but so far, prior
work has focused almost exclusively on performing measurements using IPv4. As
the Internet grows, and more users connect, IPv6 is increasingly supported and
available to users and servers alike. But despite this steady growth, it
remains unclear if the information control systems that implement censorship
(firewalls, deep packet inspection, DNS injection, etc) are as effective with
IPv6 traffic as they are with IPv4. In this paper, we perform the first global
measurement of DNS censorship on the IPv6 Internet. Leveraging a recent
technique that allows us to discover IPv6-capable open resolvers (along with
their corresponding IPv4 address), we send over 20 million A and AAAA DNS
requests to DNS resolvers worldwide, and measure the rate at which they block,
at the resolver, network, and country level as well examine the characteristics
of blocked domains. We observe that while nearly all censors support blocking
IPv6, their policies are inconsistent with and frequently less effective than
their IPv4 censorship infrastructure. Our results suggest that supporting IPv6
censorship is not all-or-nothing: many censors support it, but poorly. As a
result, these censors may have to expend additional resources to bring IPv6
censorship up to parity with IPv4. In the meantime, this affords censorship
circumvention researchers a new opportunity to exploit these differences to
evade detection and blocking.

Conclusion: 语义和任务导向的通信范式显著提升了V2X网络的可扩展性，为6G时代的通信系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The design of communication systems has traditionally focused on the reliable
and timely delivery of data. However, the scalability challenges faced by the
evolution to a 6G-driven society demand new communication paradigms that
carefully curate the content being transmitted. This paper envisions a joint
semantic and task-oriented communication paradigm where Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) transmit only the information necessary to convey
the desired meaning that is relevant to the intended receivers based on the
communication context. The V2X domain offers a unique environment for the
development of the envisioned semantic and task-oriented communications
paradigm, as CAVs are native semantic devices, and the V2X domain is rich in
contextual information. This contextual information can be leveraged to
estimate the relevance that information may have for the intended receivers. We
illustrate and quantitatively evaluate the potential benefits of semantic and
task-oriented V2X communications. Numerical results show that by focusing on
the transmission of the most relevant information for the intended receivers,
semantic and task-oriented V2X communications can achieve a two-fold
improvement in communication efficiency, which will significantly benefit the
scalability of V2X networks.

Conclusion: SECOPA方法在IC-UASNs中实现了公平有效的通信和鲁棒性，为不完美条件下的网络性能优化提供了解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fair-effective communication and robustness in
imperfect and energy-constrained underwater acoustic sensor networks
(IC-UASNs). Specifically, we investigate the impact of unexpected node
malfunctions on the network performance under the time-varying acoustic
channels. Each node is expected to satisfy Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements. However, achieving individual QoS requirements may interfere with
other concurrent communications. Underwater nodes rely excessively on the
rationality of other underwater nodes when guided by fully cooperative
approaches, making it difficult to seek a trade-off between individual QoS and
global fair-effective communications under imperfect conditions. Therefore,
this paper presents a SEmi-COoperative Power Allocation approach (SECOPA) that
achieves fair-effective communication and robustness in IC-UASNs. The approach
is distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and the
objectives are twofold. On the one hand, each intelligent node individually
decides the transmission power to simultaneously optimize individual and global
performance. On the other hand, advanced training algorithms are developed to
provide imperfect environments for training robust models that can adapt to the
time-varying acoustic channels and handle unexpected node failures in the
network. Numerical results are presented to validate our proposed approach.

Motivation: 在密集的5G及更高频段部署中，IAB至关重要，尤其是在毫米波频段光纤回传不可行的情况下，需要高效的动态调度和资源分配方法。

Result: 在96种动态拓扑中，调度准确率达到99.84%，吞吐量比基线提高了20.90%。

Conclusion: 该框架高效且适应性强，适用于动态和资源受限的部署环境，能够快速调度链路并自主协调回传。

Abstract: Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) is critical for dense 5G and beyond
deployments, especially in mmWave bands where fiber backhaul is infeasible. We
propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for joint link
scheduling and resource slicing in dynamic, interference-prone IAB networks.
Our method integrates a greedy Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) scheduler to
activate access and backhaul links based on traffic and topology, with a
multi-agent DDQN allocator for bandwidth and antenna assignment across network
slices. This decentralized approach respects strict antenna constraints and
supports concurrent scheduling across heterogeneous links. Evaluations across
96 dynamic topologies show 99.84 percent scheduling accuracy and 20.90 percent
throughput improvement over baselines. The framework's efficient operation and
adaptability make it suitable for dynamic and resource-constrained deployments,
where fast link scheduling and autonomous backhaul coordination are vital.

Conclusion: ICRL-JSA为能量受限和不可靠的UWSNs提供了一种有效的通信优化方法。

Abstract: Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) stand as promising technologies
facilitating diverse underwater applications. However, the major design issues
of the considered system are the severely limited energy supply and unexpected
node malfunctions. This paper aims to provide fair, efficient, and reliable
(FER) communication to the imperfect and energy-constrained UWSNs (IC-UWSNs).
Therefore, we formulate a FER-communication optimization problem (FERCOP) and
propose ICRL-JSA to solve the formulated problem. ICRL-JSA is a deep
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based optimizer for IC-UWSNs through
joint link scheduling and power allocation, which automatically learns
scheduling algorithms without human intervention. However, conventional RL
methods are unable to address the challenges posed by underwater environments
and IC-UWSNs. To construct ICRL-JSA, we integrate deep Q-network into IC-UWSNs
and propose an advanced training mechanism to deal with complex acoustic
channels, limited energy supplies, and unexpected node malfunctions. Simulation
results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ICRL-JSA scheme with an
advanced training mechanism compared to various benchmark algorithms.

Motivation: 传统变换器架构无法有效处理6G O-RAN中的超高频、非平稳时间序列数据，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 结合回声状态网络（ESN）和掩码自编码技术，通过无监督预训练和轻量级微调，实现高效的时间序列建模。

Result: 在O-RAN KPI预测任务中，RA-MAT实现了低于0.06的均方误差（MSE）。

Conclusion: RA-MAT为6G网络中的实时基础分析提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Next-generation open radio access networks (O-RAN) continuously stream tens
of key performance indicators (KPIs) together with raw in-phase/quadrature (IQ)
samples, yielding ultra-high-dimensional, non-stationary time series that
overwhelm conventional transformer architectures. We introduce a
reservoir-augmented masked autoencoding transformer (RA-MAT). This time series
foundation model employs echo state network (ESN) computing with masked
autoencoding to satisfy the stringent latency, energy efficiency, and
scalability requirements of 6G O-RAN testing. A fixed, randomly initialized ESN
rapidly projects each temporal patch into a rich dynamical embedding without
backpropagation through time, converting the quadratic self-attention
bottleneck into a lightweight linear operation. These embeddings drive a
patch-wise masked autoencoder that reconstructs 30% randomly masked patches,
compelling the encoder to capture both local dynamics and long-range structure
from unlabeled data. After self-supervised pre-training, RA-MAT is fine-tuned
with a shallow task head while keeping the reservoir and most transformer
layers frozen, enabling low-footprint adaptation to diverse downstream tasks
such as O-RAN KPI forecasting. In a comprehensive O-RAN KPI case study, RA-MAT
achieved sub-0.06 mean squared error (MSE) on several continuous and discrete
KPIs. This work positions RA-MAT as a practical pathway toward real-time,
foundation-level analytics in future 6G networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多节点同时传输数据时的资源限制问题，利用建设性干扰实现高效数据收集。

Method: 使用粗粒度拓扑信息选择网络子集，通过子模优化算法确定传感器激活位置和时间，最小化预测误差。

Result: 在真实测试环境中验证了STAIR框架的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: STAIR是一种高效、可扩展的无线传感器网络框架，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: A new class of Wireless Sensor Network has emerged whereby multiple nodes
transmit data simultaneously, exploiting constructive interference to enable
data collection frameworks with low energy usage and latency. This paper
presents STAIR (Spatio-Temporal Activation for Intelligent Relaying), a
scalable, resilient framework for Wireless Sensor Networks that leverages
constructive interference and operates effectively under stringent resource
constraints. Using constructive interference requires all nodes to transmit the
same packet at the same time, thus, only one source node can send data per time
slot. STAIR uses coarse-grained topology information to flood a selected subset
of the network, relaying sensor readings from individual nodes during their
allocated time slots. A submodular optimisation algorithm with proven quality
bounds determines near-optimal sensor activation locations and times, aiming to
minimise the sum of mean squared prediction errors from a multiple multivariate
linear regression model, which is used to estimate values at unselected
locations and times. This framework has been extensively validated on a
real-world testbed deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LEARN-GDM的优化框架，通过深度强化学习动态分配生成扩散模型（GDMs）在移动边缘网络中的计算资源，以解决实时部署的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成扩散模型（GDMs）在复杂数据生成任务中表现出色，但其迭代和资源密集的推理过程限制了在实时和移动环境中的部署。

Method: 提出LEARN-GDM算法，结合贪婪多址接入方案和基于D3QL的服务放置策略，动态分配去噪块并减少推理步骤。

Result: 仿真表明，该框架在可扩展性和延迟弹性方面优于传统的固定链长放置策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为边缘支持的生成AI提供了适应性解决方案，为分布式环境中的语义网络和协同推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have emerged as key components of
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), offering unparalleled
expressiveness and controllability for complex data generation tasks. However,
their deployment in real-time and mobile environments remains challenging due
to the iterative and resource-intensive nature of the inference process.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a unified optimization
framework that jointly tackles service placement and multiple access control
for GDMs in mobile edge networks. We propose LEARN-GDM, a Deep Reinforcement
Learning-based algorithm that dynamically partitions denoising blocks across
heterogeneous edge nodes, while accounting for latent transmission costs and
enabling adaptive reduction of inference steps. Our approach integrates a
greedy multiple access scheme with a Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning
(D3QL)-based service placement, allowing for scalable, adaptable, and
resource-efficient operation under stringent quality of service requirements.
Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in
terms of scalability and latency resilience compared to conventional monolithic
and fixed chain-length placement strategies. This work advances the state of
the art in edge-enabled GenAI by offering an adaptable solution for GDM
services orchestration, paving the way for future extensions toward semantic
networking and co-inference across distributed environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件驱动程序的执行一致性验证是一个核心问题，需要一种形式化的方法来确保程序的正确性。

Method: 提出了基于执行图的公理语义方法，并将其与操作语义等价性证明。

Result: 证明了事件驱动一致性问题是NP完全的，但在无嵌套发布的情况下可在多项式时间内解决。

Conclusion: 通过原型工具的实验验证了方法的有效性，为事件驱动程序的验证提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Event-driven programming is a popular paradigm where the flow of execution is
controlled by two features: (1) shared memory and (2) sending and receiving of
messages between multiple handler threads (just called handler). Each handler
has a mailbox (modelled as a queue) for receiving messages, with the constraint
that the handler processes its messages sequentially. Executions of messages by
different handlers may be interleaved. A central problem in this setting is
checking whether a candidate execution is consistent with the semantics of
event-driven programs. In this paper, we propose an axiomatic semantics for
eventdriven programs based on the standard notion of traces (also known as
execution graphs). We prove the equivalence of axiomatic and operational
semantics. This allows us to rephrase the consistency problem axiomatically,
resulting in the event-driven consistency problem: checking whether a given
trace is consistent. We analyze the computational complexity of this problem
and show that it is NP-complete, even when the number of handler threads is
bounded. We then identify a tractable fragment: in the absence of nested
posting, where handlers do not post new messages while processing a message,
consistency checking can be performed in polynomial time. Finally, we implement
our approach in a prototype tool and report on experimental results on a wide
range of benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了GitHub上长期分叉（变体）的补丁集成问题，提出了一种名为RePatch的解决方案，能够通过重构感知的方式提高补丁集成成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期分叉（变体）在独立开发过程中会出现代码结构漂移，导致补丁集成困难，传统工具如Git cherry-pick因语法差异失败率高。

Method: RePatch扩展了RefMerge框架，支持非对称补丁传输，通过反转重构操作对齐补丁上下文，再应用补丁并重放变换。

Result: 在478个补丁请求中，Git cherry-pick失败率为64.4%，而RePatch成功集成了52.8%的失败补丁。

Conclusion: 结果表明，基于语义推理的工具在变体补丁传播中优于语法工具，RePatch为解决结构漂移问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While most forks on platforms like GitHub are short-lived and used for social
collaboration, a smaller but impactful subset evolve into long-lived forks,
referred to here as variants, that maintain independent development
trajectories. Integrating bug-fix patches across such divergent variants poses
challenges due to structural drift, including refactorings that rename,
relocate, or reorganize code elements and obscure semantic correspondence. This
paper presents an empirical study of patch integration failures in 14 divergent
pair of variants and introduces RePatch, a refactoring-aware integration system
for Java repositories. RePatch extends the RefMerge framework, originally
designed for symmetric merges, by supporting asymmetric patch transfer. RePatch
inverts refactorings in both the source and target to realign the patch
context, applies the patch, and replays the transformations to preserve the
intent of the variant. In our evaluation of 478 bug-fix pull requests, Git
cherry-pick fails in 64.4% of cases due to structural misalignments, while
RePatch successfully integrates 52.8% of the previously failing patches. These
results highlight the limitations of syntax-based tools and the need for
semantic reasoning in variant-aware patch propagation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建准确、全面且无歧义的验收标准在用户界面密集型应用中具有挑战性，因为仅依赖文本需求难以捕捉领域知识和视觉上下文。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，结合多模态需求数据（文本和视觉UI信息）生成验收标准，并通过工业案例研究进行系统评估。

Result: 结果表明，多模态信息的整合显著提升了生成的ACs的质量，减少了人工工作量，并更准确地捕捉了利益相关者的意图。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG技术在优化软件验证流程和提高开发效率方面具有显著潜力，研究还公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: Acceptance criteria (ACs) play a critical role in software development by
clearly defining the conditions under which a software feature satisfies
stakeholder expectations. However, manually creating accurate, comprehensive,
and unambiguous acceptance criteria is challenging, particularly in user
interface-intensive applications, due to the reliance on domain-specific
knowledge and visual context that is not always captured by textual
requirements alone. To address these challenges, we propose RAGcceptance M2RE,
a novel approach that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
generate acceptance criteria from multi-modal requirements data, including both
textual documentation and visual UI information. We systematically evaluated
our approach in an industrial case study involving an education-focused
software system used by approximately 100,000 users. The results indicate that
integrating multi-modal information significantly enhances the relevance,
correctness, and comprehensibility of the generated ACs. Moreover, practitioner
evaluations confirm that our approach effectively reduces manual effort,
captures nuanced stakeholder intent, and provides valuable criteria that domain
experts may overlook, demonstrating practical utility and significant potential
for industry adoption. This research underscores the potential of multi-modal
RAG techniques in streamlining software validation processes and improving
development efficiency. We also make our implementation and a dataset
available.

TL;DR: IRENE是一个基于LLM的框架，通过整合规则和语义提升C代码到Rust的翻译质量，解决了现有方法在语法规则和语义一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如静态规则或直接提示）在C到Rust的翻译中难以兼顾语法规则和语义一致性，IRENE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: IRENE包含三个模块：规则增强检索模块、结构化摘要模块和错误驱动翻译模块，分别优化规则处理、语义理解和翻译迭代。

Result: 在xCodeEval和HW-Bench数据集上测试，IRENE显著提升了翻译准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: IRENE通过整合规则和语义，有效提升了C到Rust的自动化翻译质量。

Abstract: Automated translation of legacy C code into Rust aims to ensure memory safety
while reducing the burden of manual migration. Early approaches in code
translation rely on static rule-based methods, but they suffer from limited
coverage due to dependence on predefined rule patterns. Recent works regard the
task as a sequence-to-sequence problem by leveraging large language models
(LLMs). Although these LLM-based methods are capable of reducing unsafe code
blocks, the translated code often exhibits issues in following Rust rules and
maintaining semantic consistency. On one hand, existing methods adopt a direct
prompting strategy to translate the C code, which struggles to accommodate the
syntactic rules between C and Rust. On the other hand, this strategy makes it
difficult for LLMs to accurately capture the semantics of complex code. To
address these challenges, we propose IRENE, an LLM-based framework that
Integrates RulEs aNd sEmantics to enhance translation. IRENE consists of three
modules: 1) a rule-augmented retrieval module that selects relevant translation
examples based on rules generated from a static analyzer developed by us,
thereby improving the handling of Rust rules; 2) a structured summarization
module that produces a structured summary for guiding LLMs to enhance the
semantic understanding of C code; 3) an error-driven translation module that
leverages compiler diagnostics to iteratively refine translations. We evaluate
IRENE on two datasets (xCodeEval, a public dataset, and HW-Bench, an industrial
dataset provided by Huawei) and eight LLMs, focusing on translation accuracy
and safety.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的应用扩展，自然语言提示的歧义性影响模型输出质量，需要一种更结构化的方法。

Method: 提出CNL-P，结合提示工程和软件工程原则，引入精确语法和语义规范，并开发NL2CNL-P转换工具和语法检查工具。

Result: 实验表明CNL-P显著提升大语言模型输出的质量和一致性。

Conclusion: CNL-P为自然语言为中心的编程范式奠定了基础，弥合了提示工程与传统软件工程的差距。

Abstract: With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they are
increasingly applied in areas like intelligent customer service, code
generation, and knowledge management. Natural language (NL) prompts act as the
``APIs'' for human-LLM interaction. To improve prompt quality, best practices
for prompt engineering (PE) have been developed, including writing guidelines
and templates. Building on this, we propose Controlled NL for Prompt (CNL-P),
which not only incorporates PE best practices but also draws on key principles
from software engineering (SE). CNL-P introduces precise grammar structures and
strict semantic norms, further eliminating NL's ambiguity, allowing for a
declarative but structured and accurate expression of user intent. This helps
LLMs better interpret and execute the prompts, leading to more consistent and
higher-quality outputs. We also introduce an NL2CNL-P conversion tool based on
LLMs, enabling users to write prompts in NL, which are then transformed into
CNL-P format, thus lowering the learning curve of CNL-P. In particular, we
develop a linting tool that checks CNL-P prompts for syntactic and semantic
accuracy, applying static analysis techniques to NL for the first time.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CNL-P enhances the quality of LLM
responses through the novel and organic synergy of PE and SE. We believe that
CNL-P can bridge the gap between emerging PE and traditional SE, laying the
foundation for a new programming paradigm centered around NL.

Motivation: 理解方法级代码变更对性能演化的影响，验证开发者的直觉假设。

Method: 对15个开源Java项目的739次提交进行大规模实证研究，使用JMH进行性能测量和统计分析方法级变更的影响。

Result: 32.7%的变更对性能有显著影响，回归比改进多1.3倍；算法变更改进潜力大但回归风险高；资深开发者变更更稳定。

Conclusion: 建议将自动化性能测试集成到持续集成流程中，以应对性能不稳定性。

Abstract: Performance is a critical quality attribute in software development, yet the
impact of method-level code changes on performance evolution remains poorly
understood. While developers often make intuitive assumptions about which types
of modifications are likely to cause performance regressions or improvements,
these beliefs lack empirical validation at a fine-grained level. We conducted a
large-scale empirical study analyzing performance evolution in 15 mature
open-source Java projects hosted on GitHub. Our analysis encompassed 739
commits containing 1,499 method-level code changes, using Java Microbenchmark
Harness (JMH) for precise performance measurement and rigorous statistical
analysis to quantify both the significance and magnitude of performance
variations. We employed bytecode instrumentation to capture method-specific
execution metrics and systematically analyzed four key aspects: temporal
performance patterns, code change type correlations, developer and complexity
factors, and domain-size interactions. Our findings reveal that 32.7% of
method-level changes result in measurable performance impacts, with regressions
occurring 1.3 times more frequently than improvements. Contrary to conventional
wisdom, we found no significant differences in performance impact distributions
across code change categories, challenging risk-stratified development
strategies. Algorithmic changes demonstrate the highest improvement potential
but carry substantial regression risk. Senior developers produce more stable
changes with fewer extreme variations, while code complexity correlates with
increased regression likelihood. Domain-size interactions reveal significant
patterns, with web server + small projects exhibiting the highest performance
instability. Our study provides empirical evidence for integrating automated
performance testing into continuous integration pipelines.

Result: 在用户研究中，CLARITY帮助用户更快且更有信心地识别警告的根本原因，且模拟显示仅需11.8次交互即可对齐规则。

Conclusion: CLARITY的主动学习总结方法显著提升了交互式警告理解的效率。

Abstract: Programmers using bug-finding tools often review their reported warnings one
by one. Based on the insight that identifying recurring themes and
relationships can enhance the cognitive process of sensemaking, we propose
CLARITY, which supports interpreting tool-generated warnings through
interactive inquiry. CLARITY derives summary rules for custom grouping of
related warnings with active feedback. As users mark warnings as interesting or
uninteresting, CLARITY's rule inference algorithm surfaces common symptoms,
highlighting structural similarities in containment, subtyping, invoked
methods, accessed fields, and expressions.
  We demonstrate CLARITY on Infer and SpotBugs warnings across two mature Java
projects. In a within-subject user study with 14 participants, users
articulated root causes for similar uninteresting warnings faster and with more
confidence using CLARITY. We observed significant individual variation in
desired grouping, reinforcing the need for customizable sensemaking. Simulation
shows that with rule-level feedback, only 11.8 interactions are needed on
average to align all inferred rules with a simulated user's labels (vs. 17.8
without). Our evaluation suggests that CLARITY's active learning-based
summarization enhances interactive warning sensemaking.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在软件开发中的广泛应用，需要更严谨的评估其在复杂代码生成任务中的表现。现有基准存在数据污染和测试不严谨的问题。

Method: CODE2BENCH通过三个创新点构建基准：1) 自动化动态更新以减少数据污染；2) 基于范围图的依赖分析，分类任务；3) 属性测试生成严谨测试套件。

Result: 构建了CODE2BENCH-2505基准，包含1,163个任务，评估16个LLMs发现模型在跨语言复杂逻辑任务中表现较差，但在Python任务中较强。

Conclusion: CODE2BENCH提供了一种抗污染、语言无关的动态基准构建方法，为LLMs在真实软件开发任务中的全面评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, rigorously evaluating their performance on complex,
real-world code generation tasks has become essential. However, existing
benchmarks often suffer from data contamination and limited test rigor,
constraining their ability to reveal model failures effectively. To address
these, we present CODE2BENCH, a end-to-end pipeline for dynamically
constructing robust and contamination-resistant benchmarks from real-world
GitHub repositories. Specifically, CODE2BENCH introduces three key innovations:
(1) Automated Dynamism, achieved through periodic ingestion of recent code to
minimize training data contamination; (2) Scope Graph-based dependency
analysis, which enables structured classification of functions into benchmark
instances with controlled dependency levels (distinguishing between
Self-Contained (SC) tasks for cross-language evaluation and Weakly
Self-Contained (WSC) tasks involving permitted library usage); and (3)
Property-Based Testing (PBT) for the automated synthesis of rigorous test
suites to enable thorough functional verification. Using this pipeline, we
construct CODE2BENCH-2505, the first benchmark derived from 880 recent Python
projects spanning diverse domains, comprising 1,163 code generation tasks with
100% average branch coverage on ground-truth implementations. Extensive
evaluation of 16 LLMs using CODE2BENCH-2505 reveals that models consistently
struggle with SC tasks requiring complex, non-standard logic and cross-language
transfer, while showing relatively stronger performance on WSC tasks in Python.
Our work introduces a contamination-resistant, language-agnostic methodology
for dynamic benchmark construction, offering a principled foundation for the
comprehensive and realistic evaluation of LLMs on real-world software
development tasks.

Motivation: 现有污点分析工具缺乏对终端用户调试的支持，无法有效回答why、why-not和what-if问题，且可视化方式难以全局分析多源和汇点的连接性。

Method: 提出TraceLens，一种问答式调试界面，支持用户提问并执行假设性分析，以调试不同连接假设对结果的影响。

Result: 用户研究表明，TraceLens用户平均准确率比CodeQL高21%，心理需求降低45%，且对识别相关流更有信心。

Conclusion: TraceLens通过问答式交互和假设性分析，显著提升了污点分析的调试能力和用户体验。

Abstract: Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of
potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries.
Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are
missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis.
Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging
capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about
dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and
models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data
flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing
taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global
impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks.
  Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be
significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first
end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It
enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the
existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the
global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative
what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity
assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows
that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average,
compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand
(NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using
TraceLens.

Conclusion: Mo2oM通过软聚类有效优化微服务分解，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Modern software systems are increasingly shifting from monolithic
architectures to microservices to enhance scalability, maintainability, and
deployment flexibility. Existing microservice extraction methods typically rely
on hard clustering, assigning each software component to a single microservice.
This approach often increases inter-service coupling and reduces intra-service
cohesion. We propose Mo2oM (Monolithic to Overlapping Microservices), a
framework that formulates microservice extraction as a soft clustering problem,
allowing components to belong probabilistically to multiple microservices. This
approach is inspired by expert-driven decompositions, where practitioners
intentionally replicate certain software components across services to reduce
communication overhead. Mo2oM combines deep semantic embeddings with structural
dependencies extracted from methodcall graphs to capture both functional and
architectural relationships. A graph neural network-based soft clustering
algorithm then generates the final set of microservices. We evaluate Mo2oM on
four open-source monolithic benchmarks and compare it against eight
state-of-the-art baselines. Our results demonstrate that Mo2oM achieves
improvements of up to 40.97% in structural modularity (balancing cohesion and
coupling), 58% in inter-service call percentage (communication overhead),
26.16% in interface number (modularity and decoupling), and 38.96% in
non-extreme distribution (service size balance) across all benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DigiTraffic提供了大量实时道路传感器数据，但高效利用这些数据需要深入理解数据质量、预处理和机器学习工具。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 通过分析DigiTraffic的道路天气相关属性，提出了一种数据预处理和利用的方法，并构建了一个基于简单路由应用的个性化道路推荐引擎。

Result: 基于真实数据验证，该方法能够有效识别并为三种不同驾驶员档案推荐个性化路线。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过合理的数据处理和方法设计，可以高效利用大规模道路数据实现个性化推荐应用。

Abstract: Digitraffic, Finland's open road data interface, provides access to
nationwide road sensors with more than 2,300 real-time attributes from 1,814
stations. However, efficiently utilizing such a versatile data API for a
practical application requires a deeper understanding of the data qualities,
preprocessing phases, and machine learning tools. This paper discusses the
challenges of large-scale road weather and traffic data. We go through the
road-weather-related attributes from DigiTraffic as a practical example of
processes required to work with such a dataset. In addition, we provide a
methodology for efficient data utilization for the target application, a
personalized road recommendation engine based on a simple routing application.
We validate our solution based on real-world data, showing we can efficiently
identify and recommend personalized routes for three different driver profiles.

TL;DR: 论文提出SHIELDA框架，用于结构化处理LLM驱动代理工作流中的异常，通过分类和预定义模式实现跨阶段恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常处理方法对执行阶段异常处理不足，无法追溯到推理阶段的根本原因，且恢复逻辑脆弱。

Method: 提出SHIELDA框架，包括异常分类器、处理模式注册表和结构化执行器，实现异常根因链接和可组合策略。

Result: 通过AutoPR代理案例验证，SHIELDA能有效实现跨阶段异常恢复。

Conclusion: SHIELDA为LLM代理工作流提供了一种模块化、结构化的异常处理解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agentic systems are software systems powered by
LLMs that autonomously reason, plan, and execute multi-step workflows to
achieve human goals, rather than merely executing predefined steps. During
execution, these workflows frequently encounter exceptions. Existing exception
handling solutions often treat exceptions superficially, failing to trace
execution-phase exceptions to their reasoning-phase root causes. Furthermore,
their recovery logic is brittle, lacking structured escalation pathways when
initial attempts fail. To tackle these challenges, we first present a
comprehensive taxonomy of 36 exception types across 12 agent artifacts.
Building on this, we propose SHIELDA (Structured Handling of Exceptions in
LLM-Driven Agentic Workflows), a modular runtime exception handling framework
for LLM agentic workflows. SHIELDA uses an exception classifier to select a
predefined exception handling pattern from a handling pattern registry. These
patterns are then executed via a structured handling executor, comprising local
handling, flow control, and state recovery, to enable phase-aware recovery by
linking exceptions to their root causes and facilitating composable strategies.
We validate SHIELDA's effectiveness through a case study on the AutoPR agent,
demonstrating effective, cross-phase recovery from a reasoning-induced
exception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开发者如何与CBAs交互，以及CBAs未能满足开发者需求的原因，以改进其设计和实用性。

Method: 通过用户研究（n=16）和访谈，分析开发者使用CBAs时的提示策略和满意度，并调查21个商业CBAs的能力。

Result: 开发者对生成代码的满意度较低（平均2.8分），主要不满源于功能、代码质量和沟通问题。研究还识别了六项挑战和五项工作流障碍。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CBAs的局限性，并提出了改进设计的机会，以提升其效率和实用性。

Abstract: Recent AI code assistants have significantly improved their ability to
process more complex contexts and generate entire codebases based on a textual
description, compared to the popular snippet-level generation. These codebase
AI assistants (CBAs) can also extend or adapt codebases, allowing users to
focus on higher-level design and deployment decisions. While prior work has
extensively studied the impact of snippet-level code generation, this new class
of codebase generation models is relatively unexplored. Despite initial
anecdotal reports of excitement about these agents, they remain less frequently
adopted compared to snippet-level code assistants. To utilize CBAs better, we
need to understand how developers interact with CBAs, and how and why CBAs fall
short of developers' needs. In this paper, we explored these gaps through a
counterbalanced user study and interview with (n = 16) students and developers
working on coding tasks with CBAs. We found that participants varied the
information in their prompts, like problem description (48% of prompts),
required functionality (98% of prompts), code structure (48% of prompts), and
their prompt writing process. Despite various strategies, the overall
satisfaction score with generated codebases remained low (mean = 2.8, median =
3, on a scale of one to five). Participants mentioned functionality as the most
common factor for dissatisfaction (77% of instances), alongside poor code
quality (42% of instances) and communication issues (25% of instances). We
delve deeper into participants' dissatisfaction to identify six underlying
challenges that participants faced when using CBAs, and extracted five barriers
to incorporating CBAs into their workflows. Finally, we surveyed 21 commercial
CBAs to compare their capabilities with participant challenges and present
design opportunities for more efficient and useful CBAs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python缺乏成熟的形式化验证工具，而现有转换工具复杂且低效。PyVeritas旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过LLMs将Python代码转换为C，再利用C的模型检查工具进行验证和错误定位。

Result: 实验表明，LLM转换准确率可达80-90%，支持小型Python程序的验证和错误诊断。

Conclusion: PyVeritas为Python程序提供了高效的形式化验证和错误定位方法。

Abstract: Python has become the dominant language for general-purpose programming, yet
it lacks robust tools for formal verification. In contrast, programmers working
in languages such as C benefit from mature model checkers, for example CBMC,
which enable exhaustive symbolic reasoning and fault localisation. The inherent
complexity of Python, coupled with the verbosity and low-level nature of
existing transpilers (e.g., Cython), have historically limited the
applicability of formal verification to Python programs.
  In this paper, we propose PyVeritas, a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for high-level transpilation from Python to C, followed
by bounded model checking and MaxSAT-based fault localisation in the generated
C code. PyVeritas enables verification and bug localisation for Python code
using existing model checking tools for C. Our empirical evaluation on two
Python benchmarks demonstrates that LLM-based transpilation can achieve a high
degree of accuracy, up to 80--90% for some LLMs, enabling effective development
environment that supports assertion-based verification and interpretable fault
diagnosis for small yet non-trivial Python programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社会碳成本估计中存在异常值，需通过更合理的约束方法去除。

Method: 提出概念性截尾方法，基于支付意愿或碳税上限约束社会碳成本。

Result: 成功去除高异常值，且方法随经济脱碳速度调整。

Conclusion: 概念性截尾方法有效且灵活，适用于不同政策背景。

Abstract: There are many published estimates of the social cost of carbon. Some are
clear outliers, the result of poorly constrained models. Percentile winsorizing
is an option, but I here propose conceptual winsorizing: The social cost of
carbon is either a willingness to pay, which cannot exceed the ability to pay,
or a proposed carbon tax, which cannot raise more revenue than all other taxes
combined. Conceptual winsorizing successfully removes high outliers. It
slackens as economies decarbonize, slowly without climate policy, faster with.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂设计（如非二元、非吸收性处理）中识别动态处理效应，以评估实际政策效果并扩展至其他政策情景。

Method: 基于无预期和平行趋势假设识别事件研究效应；引入随机系数分布滞后线性模型以简化估计。

Result: 事件研究效应可用于评估实际政策，但解释性有限；随机系数模型提供了更简单的估计方法。

Conclusion: 随机系数模型为动态处理效应的识别和估计提供了更实用的框架，适用于复杂设计。

Abstract: This paper considers the identification of dynamic treatment effects with
panel data, in complex designs where the treatment may not be binary and may
not be absorbing. We first show that under no-anticipation and parallel-trends
assumptions, we can identify event-study effects comparing outcomes under the
actual treatment path and under the status-quo path where all units would have
kept their period-one treatment throughout the panel. Those effects can be
helpful to evaluate ex-post the policies that effectively took place, and once
properly normalized they estimate weighted averages of marginal effects of the
current and lagged treatments on the outcome. Yet, they may still be hard to
interpret, and they cannot be used to evaluate the effects of other policies
than the ones that were conducted. To make progress, we impose another
restriction, namely a random coefficients distributed-lag linear model, where
effects remain constant over time. Under this model, the usual distributed-lag
two-way-fixed-effects regression may be misleading. Instead, we show that this
random coefficients model can be estimated simply. We illustrate our findings
by revisiting Gentzkow et al. (2011).

Conclusion: 亚马逊MTA通过实验与模型的结合，提升了广告效果归因的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Amazon's new Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) solution allows advertisers to
measure how each touchpoint across the marketing funnel contributes to a
conversion. This gives advertisers a more comprehensive view of their Amazon
Ads performance across objectives when multiple ads influence shopping
decisions. Amazon MTA uses a combination of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
and machine learning (ML) models to allocate credit for Amazon conversions
across Amazon Ads touchpoints in proportion to their value, i.e., their likely
contribution to shopping decisions. ML models trained purely on observational
data are easy to scale and can yield precise predictions, but the models might
produce biased estimates of ad effects. RCTs yield unbiased ad effects but can
be noisy. Our MTA methodology combines experiments, ML models, and Amazon's
shopping signals in a thoughtful manner to inform attribution credit
allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推断方法难以捕捉空间溢出效应的动态演变，尤其是在局部干预逐渐影响全局经济时。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用DDPM与边界检测方法，将空间溢出效应建模为Lévy过程，并通过CUSUM序列检测识别临界阈值。

Result: 在日本都道府县的AI采用案例中，发现Lévy跳跃出现在约35公里空间尺度，全局均衡效应将局部均衡估计放大了42%。

Conclusion: 该框架首次提供了识别空间溢出效应何时需要全局均衡分析的严格方法，对政策评估具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for causal inference in spatial
economics that explicitly models the stochastic transition from partial to
general equilibrium effects. We develop a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Model (DDPM) integrated with boundary detection methods from stochastic process
theory to identify when and how treatment effects propagate beyond local
markets. Our approach treats the evolution of spatial spillovers as a L\'evy
process with jump-diffusion dynamics, where the first passage time to critical
thresholds indicates regime shifts from partial to general equilibrium. Using
CUSUM-based sequential detection, we identify the spatial and temporal
boundaries at which local interventions become systemic. Applied to AI adoption
across Japanese prefectures, we find that treatment effects exhibit L\'evy
jumps at approximately 35km spatial scales, with general equilibrium effects
amplifying partial equilibrium estimates by 42\%. Monte Carlo simulations show
that ignoring these stochastic boundaries leads to underestimation of treatment
effects by 28-67\%, with particular severity in densely connected economic
regions. Our framework provides the first rigorous method for determining when
spatial spillovers necessitate general equilibrium analysis, offering crucial
guidance for policy evaluation in interconnected economies.

Result: 刺激支票导致加密货币外流短期显著增加，财政溢出效应上限为2.52%。

Conclusion: 通过汇款渠道的财政溢出效应规模可能较小。

Abstract: This paper examines fiscal policy spillovers through informal international
financial channels, using the US stimulus checks as a positive, sudden, and
direct fiscal shock. I utilize granular, transaction-level cryptocurrency data
combined with an algorithm to probabilistically identify cross-border "crypto
vehicle" transactions to construct bilateral cryptocurrency flows between
countries. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I compare cryptocurrency
outflows between the US and other high-income countries and find a sharp but
temporary increase in cryptocurrency outflows as a result of the direct
stimulus. I quantify the fiscal spillover relative to expenditure and place an
upper bound of 2.52% through this channel. This implies that fiscal spillovers
through remittance channels are likely modest in size.

Abstract: Brand equity and vertical integration are focal, strategic elements of a
franchise system that can profoundly influence franchise performance. Despite
the recognized importance of these two strategic levers and the longstanding
research interest in the topic, our understanding of the interplay between
brand equity and vertical integration (company ownership of outlets) in a
franchise system remains incomplete. In this study, we revisit the
five-decade-old question of how brand equity affects vertical integration in a
franchise system and present some novel, nuanced insights into the topic.
Evidence from a Bayesian Panel Vector Autoregressive model on a large panel
data set shows that brand equity has a powerful, lagging inverse effect on
vertical integration, such that higher brand equity leads to less downstream
vertical integration in a franchise system. Reverse causality analyses identify
a less pronounced but present reciprocal effect. Boundary conditions analyses
reveal that the negative effect of brand equity on vertical integration is
weaker in franchise systems with international presence and in retail-focused
(vs. service-focused) franchises, and stronger in franchise systems with more
financial resources. These findings (a) challenge traditional views (e.g.,
transaction cost theory, resource-based view, ownership redirection hypothesis)
on the topic by demonstrating a negative effect for brand equity on vertical
integration in franchise systems and showing that greater financial resources
amplify this effect, and (b) shed new light on the intricate dynamics (temporal
causation, reverse causation) and contingencies of this debated effect.
Managerially, this research draws attention to the underrecognized strategic
benefit of brand equity in mitigating channel governance issues and advise
against unnecessary vertical integration, especially when brand equity is
robust.

Conclusion: 提出供应链韧性框架，强调GVC参与度、功能定位和再耦合能力，对贸易政策和产业战略有重要启示。

Abstract: US-China trade tensions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine
conflict have disrupted and reshaped global supply chains. Existing studies
caution that these tensions may not meaningfully reduce U.S. dependence on
China-linked supply chains. This study examines the drivers of this unmet
reallocation under overlapping geopolitical and public health disruptions. It
investigates how these shocks jointly reconfigured bilateral trade and global
value chain (GVC) participation and positioning among the U.S., China, and
major trading partners during 2016-2023. Using monthly bilateral trade data
across all sectors and multi-regional input-output tables for GVC
decomposition, we combine a multi-period event-study with structural analysis
to evaluate trade-flow disruptions and shifts in participation and functional
positioning within GVCs. We find that China's exports remained robust, expanded
across global markets, and sustained a rise in GVC participation, becoming more
embedded in upstream segments through increased intermediate shipments to Asia
and Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. imports increasingly shifted toward "China+1"
partners, especially ASEAN, whose trade structures remain closely tied to
Chinese upstream supply chains. These strengthening triangular relationships
reveal how global reallocation and GVCs have evolved around the U.S. and China
across successive shocks. Based on the evidence, we propose a supply chain
resilience framework defined by three interacting dimensions: the level of GVC
participation, the functional position within the value chain, and a country's
capacity to re-couple in the post-shock landscape, conditioned by market
diversification, economic complexity, and institutional capability. These
findings carry significant implications for trade policy and industrial
strategy in an era of geopolitical and geoeconomic fragmentation.

Conclusion: 宏观审慎政策对信贷结构有显著影响，但需与货币政策协调以实现更全面的效果。

Abstract: The global financial crisis (GFC) triggered the use of macroprudential
policies imposed on the banking sector. Using bank-level panel data for Israel
for the period 2004-2019, we find that domestic macroprudential measures
changed the composition of bank credit growth but did not affect the total
credit growth rate. Specifically, we show that macroprudential measures
targeted at the housing sector moderated housing credit growth but tended to
increase business credit growth. We also find that accommodative monetary
policy surprises tended to increase bank credit growth before the GFC. We show
that accommodative monetary policy surprises increased consumer credit when
interacting with macroprudential policies targeting the housing market.
Accommodative monetary policy interacted with nonhousing macroprudential
measures to increase total credit.

Abstract: Post-growth has emerged as an umbrella term for various sustainability
visions that advocate the pursuit of environmental sustainability, social
equity, and human wellbeing, while questioning the continued pursuit of
economic growth. Although there are increasing calls to include post-growth
scenarios in high-level assessments, a coherent framework with what is required
to model post-growth adequately remains absent. This article addresses this gap
by: (1) identifying the minimum requirements for post-growth models, and (2)
establishing a set of model elements for representing specific policy themes.
Drawing on a survey of modellers and on relevant post-growth literature, we
develop a framework of minimum requirements for post-growth modelling that
integrates three spheres: biophysical, economic, and social, and links them to
post-growth goals. Within the biophysical sphere, we argue that embeddedness
requires the inclusion of resource use and pollution, environmental limits, and
feedback mechanisms from the environment onto society. Within the economic
sphere, models should disaggregate households, incorporate limits to
technological change and decoupling, include different types of government
interventions, and calculate GDP or output endogenously. Within the social
sphere, models should represent time use, material and non-material need
satisfiers, and the affordability of essential goods and services. Specific
policies and transformation scenarios require additional features, such as
sectoral disaggregation or representation of the financial system. Our
framework guides the development of models that can simulate both post-growth
and pro-growth policies and scenarios, an urgently needed tool for informing
policymakers and stakeholders about the full range of options for pursuing
sustainability, equity, and wellbeing.

Motivation: 揭示Markowitz模型在交易量波动时的局限性，提出更贴近实际市场的投资组合收益和方差计算方法。

Method: 通过分析投资者不交易证券时的市场交易数据，构建时间序列模型，推导投资组合收益和方差的真实依赖关系。

Result: 发现Markowitz方差可能显著高估或低估实际市场方差，交易量波动是关键影响因素。

Conclusion: Markowitz模型在交易量恒定时有效，但实际应用中需考虑交易量波动，市场方差更准确。

Abstract: In his famous paper, Markowitz (1952) derived the dependence of portfolio
random returns on the random returns of its securities. This result allowed
Markowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that
Markowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for
portfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation
of the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the
securities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show
this, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his
portfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his
securities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio
as with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and
variance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities
describe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the
dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and
on the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random
volumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the
consecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation
for the portfolio's random returns. The market-based variance of the portfolio
accounts for the effects of random fluctuations of the volumes of the
consecutive trades. The use of Markowitz variance may give significantly higher
or lower estimates than market-based portfolio variance.

evidence of discontinuities in the distribution of relative income within
households in Latin America. Similar to high-income countries, we observe a
sharp drop at the 50% threshold, where the wife earns more than the husband,
but the discontinuity is up to five times larger and has increased over time.
These patterns are robust to excluding equal earners, self-employed
individuals, or couples in the same occupation/industry. Discontinuities
persist across subgroups, including couples with or without children, married
or unmarried partners, and those with older wives or female household heads. We
also find comparable discontinuities in Brazil and Panama, as well as among
some same-sex couples. Moreover, women who are primary earners continue to
supply more non-market labor than their male partners, although the gap is
narrower than in households where the woman is the secondary earner.

TL;DR: 研究发现，男性远程工作机会增加会显著提高其配偶的就业率，主要原因是家庭内育儿时间的重新分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨远程工作对家庭内劳动力供给的影响，尤其是男性远程工作机会增加对其配偶就业的影响。

Method: 利用COVID-19前后不同职业远程工作暴露程度的变化，分析女性就业率的变化，并结合时间使用日记和育儿问卷调查。

Result: 女性就业率提高了2个百分点（相当于疫情前水平的4%），男性在家工作部分弥补了配偶的育儿时间。

Conclusion: 研究强调了家庭内溢出效应和谈判在远程工作对劳动力市场影响中的重要性。

Abstract: We study how increases in remote work opportunities for men affect their
spouses' labor supply. Exploiting variation in the change in work-from-home
(WFH) exposure across occupations before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, we
find that women whose husbands experienced larger WFH increases are over 2
percentage points more likely to be employed, equivalent to a 4% rise relative
to pre-pandemic levels. Evidence from time-use diaries and childcare
questionnaires suggests these effects are driven by intra-household
reallocation of child-caring time: women are less likely to engage in primary
childcare activities, while men working at home partially compensate by
covering more for their spouse. These results highlight the role of
intra-household spillovers and bargaining in shaping the labor market
consequences of remote work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在决策理论中统一描述熵，并探讨混合过程本身的价值。

Method: 引入过程混合集，扩展传统混合集的定义，应用冯·诺依曼-摩根斯坦公理。

Result: 证明熵可以作为过程价值的表示，揭示了多选项选择中漂移扩散模型的扩展困难。

Conclusion: 熵在决策过程中具有内在价值，为多选项选择模型提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: The paper characterizes the Shannon (1948) and Tsallis (1988) entropies in a
standard framework of decision theory, mixture sets. Procedural mixture sets
are introduced as a variant of mixture sets in which it is not necessarily true
that a mixture of two identical elements yields the same element. This allows
the process of mixing itself to have an intrinsic value. The paper proves the
surprising result that simply imposing the standard axioms of von
Neumann-Morgenstern on preferences on a procedural mixture set yields the
entropy as a representation of procedural value. An application of the theorem
to decision processes and the relation between choice probabilities and
decision times elucidates the difficulty of extending the drift-diffusion model
to multi-alternative choice.

Motivation: 探讨在代理人基数估值独立且非同分布的情况下，匿名投票机制的设计及其性能。

Method: 分析二元社会选择环境中的投票机制，比较序数多数规则和基数机制在不同代理人数量下的表现。

Result: 两个代理人时，序数多数规则总是最优；三个及以上代理人时，基数机制可能更优。

Conclusion: 代理人数量影响投票机制的选择，基数机制在复杂环境中可能更具优势。

Abstract: We study the design of voting mechanisms in a binary social choice
environment where agents' cardinal valuations are independent but not
necessarily identically distributed. The mechanism must be anonymous -- the
outcome is invariant to permutations of the reported values. We show that if
there are two agents then expected welfare is always maximized by an ordinal
majority rule, but with three or more agents there are environments in which
cardinal mechanisms that take into account preference intensities outperform
any ordinal mechanism.

Method: 提出了一种轻量级方法，整合解剖学知识和基于规则的拓扑约束，用于冠状动脉自动标记。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为冠状动脉自动标记提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Method: 采用体素空间方法，结合多模态患者数据（如MRI和治疗信息），预测未来的新增大T2（NET2）病灶。

Result: 在2131名患者的3D MRI数据集上验证，模型能准确预测六种不同治疗方案的NET2病灶，并展示出临床应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了因果性图像生成模型在MS数据驱动预后中的潜力。

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在医学影像任务中常产生幻觉（自信但错误的输出），可能误导临床决策，因此需要系统研究其错误模式及原因。

Method: 研究从两个方向分析幻觉：图像到文本（生成影像报告）和文本到图像（生成医学影像），使用专家标准评估输出的错误（如事实不一致和解剖不准确）。

Result: 发现两种任务中均存在常见的幻觉模式，并探讨了模型架构和训练数据等因素对错误的影响。

Conclusion: 通过系统研究，为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time novel view synthesis with high
visual fidelity, but its substantial storage requirements hinder practical
deployment, prompting state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS methods to incorporate
compression modules. However, these 3DGS generative compression techniques
introduce unique distortions lacking systematic quality assessment research. To
this end, we establish 3DGS-VBench, a large-scale Video Quality Assessment
(VQA) Dataset and Benchmark with 660 compressed 3DGS models and video sequences
generated from 11 scenes across 6 SOTA 3DGS compression algorithms with
systematically designed parameter levels. With annotations from 50
participants, we obtained MOS scores with outlier removal and validated dataset
reliability. We benchmark 6 3DGS compression algorithms on storage efficiency
and visual quality, and evaluate 15 quality assessment metrics across multiple
paradigms. Our work enables specialized VQA model training for 3DGS, serving as
a catalyst for compression and quality assessment research. The dataset is

Conclusion: SAGCNet通过结合切片间关系和3D空间信息，显著提升了缺失切片的合成效果，为MRI数据补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

Result: 在200个基因的实验中，HaDM-ST在空间保真度和基因级一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HaDM-ST通过结合H&E图像和低分辨率ST，显著提升了高分辨率ST预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and
gene-level coherence in high-resolution ST predictions.

Result: EfficientNetV2S模型准确率达93.65%，结合HITL系统后进一步提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 人机协作方法为AI辅助医疗诊断提供了高效、高精度的新方向。

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent

quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are essential to human health, and their precise
morphological analysis is important for diagnosing hematological disorders.
Despite the promise of foundation models in medical diagnostics, comprehensive
AI solutions for RBC analysis remain scarce. We present RedDino, a
self-supervised foundation model designed for RBC image analysis. RedDino uses
an RBC-specific adaptation of the DINOv2 self-supervised learning framework and
is trained on a curated dataset of 1.25 million RBC images from diverse
acquisition modalities and sources. Extensive evaluations show that RedDino
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on RBC shape classification.
Through assessments including linear probing and nearest neighbor
classification, we confirm its strong feature representations and
generalization ability. Our main contributions are: (1) a foundation model
tailored for RBC analysis, (2) ablation studies exploring DINOv2 configurations
for RBC modeling, and (3) a detailed evaluation of generalization performance.
RedDino addresses key challenges in computational hematology by capturing
nuanced morphological features, advancing the development of reliable
diagnostic tools. The source code and pretrained models for RedDino are
available at https://github.com/Snarci/RedDino, and the pretrained models can
be downloaded from our Hugging Face collection at

Conclusion: ALDEN通过解剖感知设计，显著提升了低剂量CT去噪的准确性和解剖结构保留能力。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence
parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image
synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

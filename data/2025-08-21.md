### [1] [Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14214)
*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在情感刺激评估方面与人类的一致性，发现GPT-4o在多个情感维度上与人类评分高度相关，但在唤醒度维度上一致性较低，且LLM评分比人类更加同质化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中的应用日益广泛，需要了解这些模型如何评估情感刺激，以确定它们是否适合作为人类代理或与人类互动。模型在情感评估方面与人类行为的一致性可以指导LLM在某些角色或交互中的有效性。

Method: 使用先前由人类评分的词汇和图像数据集，让多个流行的LLM进行相同的评分任务，比较LLM与人类在情感内容评估上的一致性。

Result: GPT-4o在大多数评分维度上与人类参与者非常相似（许多情况下r=0.9或更高），但唤醒度评分的一致性较差，而快乐评分的一致性最高。LLM在五类情感框架（快乐、愤怒、悲伤、恐惧、厌恶）中的一致性优于二维组织（唤醒度和效价）。LLM评分比人类评分更加同质化。

Conclusion: 这些结果描述了LLM代理如何解释情感刺激，并突出了生物智能和人工智能在关键行为领域的相似性和差异，为LLM在情感相关应用中的适用性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

### [2] [Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14294)
*Maria Leonor Pacheco,Fabio Somenzi,Dananjay Srinivas,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合决策程序和大型语言模型的神经符号方法，用于解释复杂的决策序列，并以Hitori谜题为例展示了该方法的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种灵活的方法来解释包含局部约束和连接性约束的复杂决策序列，结合SAT求解器和LLM的优势

Method: 开发了一个神经符号工具，结合SAT求解器处理局部约束的解析证明，使用LLM生成视觉化解释来处理连接性约束

Result: 实现了辅助人类解决Hitori谜题的工具，并通过实验证明了其有效性

Conclusion: 神经符号方法成功结合了决策程序和LLM的优势，为复杂决策序列的解释提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

### [3] [Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)
*Beinuo Yang,Qishen Zhou,Junyi Li,Xingchen Su,Simon Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ORThought框架，通过思维链推理应用专家级优化建模原则来自动化优化建模过程，解决了现有LLM方法在优化建模中的三大局限性：高错误率、评估范围窄和计算效率低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化建模过程耗时且容易出错，严重依赖领域专家。虽然大语言模型通过自然语言理解和推理能力显示出解决这些挑战的潜力，但现有方法存在高错误率（达42%）、评估范围窄（仅考虑最优值）以及计算效率低（依赖多智能体系统或模型微调）三大局限性。

Method: 首先通过系统错误校正和更全面的标注增强现有数据集；引入LogiOR物流领域新基准，包含更复杂问题和标准化标注；提出ORThought框架，利用思维链推理应用专家级优化建模原则来自动化优化建模过程。

Result: 通过广泛实证评估，ORThought优于现有方法（包括多智能体框架），在复杂优化问题上具有特别显著的优势。

Conclusion: 提供了方法的系统分析，识别了关键成功因素和失败模式，为基于LLM的优化建模未来研究提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

### [4] [The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)
*Qiang Zhang,Pei Yan,Yijia Xu,Chuanpo Fu,Yong Fang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出网络行为生命周期模型和A4A范式，分析人类与AI代理在5个维度的行为差异，为解决人机协作中的信任和责任问题提供理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在网络环境中越来越像人类行为，导致信任、责任、伦理和安全等方面的挑战，需要系统性的行为分析框架。

Method: 提出网络行为生命周期模型（6阶段分析）和A4A范式，建立人类-代理行为差异模型（HABD），从决策机制、执行效率等5个维度进行对比分析。

Result: 通过红队渗透和蓝队防御等实际案例验证了模型的有效性，为安全可信的人机协作提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文为未来动态认知治理架构、行为差异量化和元治理协议栈等研究方向提供了技术路线图，推动安全可信的人机协作发展。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

### [5] [Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564)
*Luca Annese,Sabrina Patania,Silvia Serino,Tom Foulsham,Silvia Rossi,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用规划器生成的转换解决方案图来创建结构化示例，以提升基于LLM的智能体在视角感知任务中的表现，但发现仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要主动感知、协作推理和视角感知（理解其他智能体能看到或知道什么）的任务中仍面临挑战，研究旨在通过结构化示例改善LLM智能体的视角感知能力。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理流程，从Fast Downward规划器生成的转换解决方案图中提取三种示例类型：最优目标路径(G型)、信息节点路径(E型)和对比替代行动的逐步最优决策序列(L型)，并通过LLM将这些解决方案转换为"思考-行动"示例。

Result: L型示例略微减少了澄清请求和总体行动步骤，但未能带来一致性的改进。智能体在需要基本注意力过滤的任务中表现成功，但在需要心理化遮挡空间或权衡认知行动成本的场景中表现挣扎。

Conclusion: 仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角感知，需要明确的信念跟踪、成本建模和更丰富的环境来支持基于LLM的智能体实现社会性协作。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

### [6] [LeanGeo: Formalizing Competitional Geometry problems in Lean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14644)
*Chendong Song,Zihan Wang,Frederick Pu,Haiming Wang,Xiaohan Lin,Junqi Liu,Jia Li,Zhengying Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanGeo是一个基于Lean 4定理证明器的统一几何形式化系统，包含高级几何定理库和LeanGeo-Bench基准测试，用于解决竞赛级几何问题并验证LLM的几何推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何求解系统无法在统一框架下表达问题，难以与其他数学领域集成，且几何证明依赖直观图表，验证困难。

Method: 在Lean 4定理证明器中构建LeanGeo系统，包含全面的高级几何定理库，与Mathlib无缝集成，并创建LeanGeo-Bench基准测试集（包含IMO等竞赛题目）。

Result: 系统能够形式化和解决竞赛级几何问题，实现对几何证明的严格验证，并评估了现有大语言模型在该基准上的表现和局限性。

Conclusion: LeanGeo为几何推理提供了统一的形式化框架，揭示了当前AI在几何推理方面的不足，需要进一步推进自动化几何推理技术的发展。

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

### [7] [Entropy-Constrained Strategy Optimization in Urban Floods: A Multi-Agent Framework with LLM and Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654)
*Peilin Ji,Xiao Xue,Simeng Wang,Wenhao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了H-J分层多智能体框架，通过知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，解决极端降雨条件下城市应急调度中的多目标权衡、动态环境适应和LLM策略稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端城市降雨事件频发导致交通拥堵和服务中断，现有方法在感知、全局优化和多智能体协调方面存在不足，特别是LLM生成的策略存在语义不稳定和执行不一致的问题。

Method: H-J分层多智能体框架，整合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，建立从多源感知到策略执行和持续优化的闭环管道。

Result: 在真实城市拓扑和降雨数据上的实验表明，H-J在交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性方面优于基于规则和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知和知识约束的LLM方法在增强城市洪水响应韧性方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

*Ziyang Luo,Zhiqi Shen,Wenzhuo Yang,Zirui Zhao,Prathyusha Jwalapuram,Amrita Saha,Doyen Sahoo,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Junnan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP-Universe是首个专门为评估LLM与真实MCP服务器交互能力而设计的综合基准测试，涵盖6个核心领域和11个不同服务器，揭示当前SOTA模型在长程推理和未知工具使用方面存在显著性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简单，无法捕捉真实应用中的挑战，如长程推理和大规模未知工具空间的使用，需要更全面的评估标准。

Method: 开发MCP-Universe基准测试，包含6个核心领域和11个MCP服务器，采用执行式评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器和动态评估器）进行严格评估。

Result: 即使是SOTA模型如GPT-5(43.72%)、Grok-4(33.33%)和Claude-4.0-Sonnet(29.44%)也表现出显著性能限制，企业级代理表现不优于标准ReAct框架。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了LLM在真实MCP环境中的重大挑战，提供了可扩展的开源评估框架，促进MCP生态系统的创新发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

*Swantje Plambeck,Ali Salamati,Eyke Huellermeier,Goerschwin Fey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于PAC学习框架的数据驱动方法，通过主动学习范式估计CPS系统在有限时间范围内的安全概率，并提供概率置信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS系统需要强大模型进行验证和诊断，但合适模型往往难以手动提取，数据驱动方法为此提供解决方案

Method: 将CPS离散抽象为Mealy机，采用主动学习范式，在初始数据集基础上引导采样新数据，基于PAC学习框架估计安全概率

Result: 方法在自动车道保持系统案例中得到验证，能够确定系统在n个时间步内的安全概率并提供额外置信度

Conclusion: 该方法建立了离散逻辑与概率可达性分析之间的联系，为CPS系统安全分析提供了数据驱动的解决方案

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

### [10] [Privileged Self-Access Matters for Introspection in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14802)
*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI模型是否能够内省，提出了比现有"轻量级"定义更"厚重"的内省定义，并通过实验证明LLMs虽然表现出轻量级内省能力，但无法满足更严格的内省标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型能否内省是一个重要的实践问题，但目前缺乏对"内省"的共识定义。作者旨在提出一个更严格、更有意义的内省定义。

Method: 作者从现有的"轻量级"内省定义出发，提出了一个更"厚重"的定义：内省是通过比第三方可用方法更可靠且计算成本相当或更低的过程获取内部状态信息。通过让LLMs推理其内部温度参数的实验来验证。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs虽然能够表现出轻量级内省的表象，但无法实现作者提出的更严格意义上的有意义内省。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的内省定义来准确评估AI模型的内省能力，当前LLMs的内省能力有限，无法满足更高质量的内省标准。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

### [11] [Confidence Estimation for Text-to-SQL in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14056)
*Sepideh Entezari Maleki,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在文本到SQL任务中的置信度估计方法，比较了黑盒和白盒策略，发现基于一致性的黑盒方法和SQL语法感知的白盒方法效果最佳，执行结果可进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问黄金答案的情况下，评估文本到SQL模型生成SQL查询的可靠性，特别是在大语言模型权重和梯度访问受限的约束条件下。

Method: 探索黑盒和白盒置信度估计策略，包括基于一致性的方法和SQL语法感知方法，并利用查询执行结果作为补充信号。

Result: 基于一致性的方法在黑盒模型中表现最优，SQL语法感知方法在白盒设置中具有优势，执行结果能有效提升两种方法的性能。

Conclusion: 置信度估计对于文本到SQL任务至关重要，结合一致性检查、语法感知和执行结果的多策略方法能提供更可靠的置信度评估。

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

*Admitos Passadakis,Yingjin Song,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 将视觉叙事视为图像描述的超集，先通过视觉-语言模型生成图像描述，再用语言-语言方法转换为连贯故事，该方法加速训练并提高故事质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡视觉叙事的两个关键方面：既要基于图像序列又要保持叙事连贯性，解决现有方法在这两者之间的权衡问题

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 使用视觉-语言模型为输入图像生成描述；2) 使用语言-语言方法将这些描述转换为连贯的叙事故事

Result: 集成图像描述和叙事到统一框架对生成故事质量有积极影响，相比先前研究加速了训练时间，框架易于重用和复现

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效平衡了视觉叙事的接地性和连贯性要求，同时提出了新的ideality度量标准来模拟与理想模型的接近程度和人类相似性

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

gaps in sociolinguistic diversity. Drawing on health-related psychometric
tasks, we collect a dataset of 2,170 free-text responses from Kenyan speakers.
The data exhibits tribal influences, urban vernacular, code-mixing, and
loanwords. We develop a structured taxonomy and use it as a lens for examining
model prediction errors across pre-trained and instruction-tuned language
models. Our findings advance culturally grounded evaluation frameworks and

*Yiran Rex Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文基于LLM注释的英汉新闻语料库，从功能块角度分析了英汉新闻在状语成分顺序上的差异，发现英语偏向核心信息先行、功能块后置，汉语偏向背景先行、功能块前置的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索英汉新闻在功能块成分顺序上的差异，分析其位置偏好和分布模式，为对比语言学研究提供新的实证支持。

Method: 基于大语言模型注释的可比英汉新闻语料库，从功能块角度对状语成分顺序进行对比分析。

Result: 1、英语新闻偏向核心信息先行、功能块后置，汉语偏向背景先行、功能块前置；2、SVO结构中汉语前置偏向更显著；3、功能块共现时两种语言都显示高灵活性。

Conclusion: 词序具有系统性偏好和动态适应性，为英汉信息结构对比研究提供了新的实证支持。

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and

*Badrinath Ramakrishnan,Akshaya Balaji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLM微调过程中的数据记忆化隐私风险，提出了多层隐私保护框架，通过四种技术将数据泄露率从60-75%降至0%，同时保持94.7%的模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中容易记忆训练数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，需要有效的保护机制。

Method: 提出了包含语义数据去重、差分隐私生成、基于熵的过滤和基于模式的内容过滤的四层隐私保护框架，并在GPT-2、Phi-3和Gemma-2等模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验显示微调重复敏感数据使隐私泄露率从基线0-5%增至60-75%，而提出的保护方法能将泄露率降至0%，同时保持94.7%的原始模型效用。

Conclusion: 该多层隐私保护框架能有效解决LLM微调中的数据记忆化问题，在几乎完全消除隐私泄露的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型中信息收集和传播的机制，重点关注标点符号的计算重要性以及不同推理规则的差异处理方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中信息如何在不同层间收集和传播，特别是标点符号作为注意力汇聚点和记忆辅助工具的作用，以及不同推理规则的处理差异。

Method: 使用基于干预的技术，在GPT-2、DeepSeek和Gemma模型中评估标点符号的必要性和充分性；通过互换干预和层交换实验研究条件语句和全称量词的处理方式。

Result: 发现模型间存在显著差异：GPT-2中多个层的标点符号既必要又充分，DeepSeek中程度较轻，Gemma中完全不成立；条件语句和全称量词的处理方式存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM中标点符号使用和推理的内部机制，为模型可解释性提供了新的见解，表明不同模型在处理相同元素时存在显著差异。

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [18] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLLMQuant是一个专门为扩散式大语言模型设计的后训练量化框架，解决了现有PTQ方法在DLLMs上的精度下降问题，通过时间-掩码自适应采样、交互感知激活量化和确定性引导量化三项技术显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(DLLMs)在非自回归文本生成方面表现出色，但直接应用现有的后训练量化方法会导致严重的精度下降和泛化性能降低，需要专门针对DLLMs特性的量化解决方案。

Method: 提出DLLMQuant框架，包含三项核心技术：1)时间-掩码自适应采样(TMAS)考虑时间和掩码因素；2)交互感知激活量化(IA-AQ)利用双向注意力交互信号动态分配量化资源；3)确定性引导量化(CGQ)整合掩码状态和token分数作为误差补偿的关键权重标准。

Result: 实验表明DLLMQuant在保持效率的同时实现了显著的性能提升，解决了现有PTQ方法在DLLMs上精度下降的问题。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant成功解决了扩散式大语言模型量化中的核心挑战，为DLLMs的高效部署提供了有效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了MMReview基准，用于评估大语言模型和多模态大语言模型在学术论文评审中的表现，涵盖多学科和多模态内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术出版物快速增长，同行评审变得重要但耗时。现有LLM辅助评审缺乏统一评估基准，特别是在处理多模态内容（如图表）时缺乏全面评估标准。

Method: 构建包含240篇论文的多学科多模态基准数据集，涵盖17个研究领域和4大学科门类。设计了13个任务，分为4个核心类别：逐步评审生成、结果制定、人类偏好对齐和对抗性输入鲁棒性。

Result: 对16个开源模型和5个先进闭源模型进行了广泛实验，证明了基准的全面性。

Conclusion: MMReview为自动化同行评审系统的开发建立了标准化基础，是推动该领域发展的重要一步。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPad是一种无需训练的方法，通过滑动窗口和距离衰减dropout策略减少扩散大语言模型的计算冗余，实现最高61.4倍的加速，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的大语言模型在文本生成时存在高计算开销问题，因为每一步都需要预测所有未来后缀词元，但只保留其中一小部分，造成大量冗余计算。

Method: 提出Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad)方法，包含两种策略：(1)滑动窗口保持固定长度的后缀窗口；(2)距离衰减dropout在注意力计算前确定性地移除远处后缀词元。该方法与现有优化技术兼容且易于实现。

Result: 在LLaDA-1.5和Dream模型上的多基准测试表明，DPad相比原始dLLMs实现最高61.4倍的加速，同时保持相当的准确性。

Conclusion: DPad展示了在高效和可扩展的长序列推理方面的潜力，为扩散大语言模型的实际应用提供了实用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了文本分类推理中模型准确性与能耗的权衡，发现最佳准确率模型也能实现能源高效，而大型语言模型能耗更高但准确率更低。执行时间可作为能耗的有效代理指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在NLP任务中的广泛应用，能效和可持续性问题日益突出。先前研究主要关注训练阶段的能耗，推理阶段的能耗研究相对不足。

Method: 通过实证分析，在不同模型架构和硬件配置下系统评估文本分类推理的准确性与能耗关系，分析模型类型、大小和硬件规格对能耗的影响。

Result: 研究发现最佳准确率模型也能实现能源高效，大型LLMs能耗显著更高但分类准确率更低。推理能耗存在巨大差异（<mWh到>kWh），且与模型运行时间强相关。

Conclusion: 执行时间可作为能耗的有效代理指标，这些发现为可持续AI发展提供了实用见解，帮助研究者、从业者和政策制定者在NLP应用中平衡性能与资源效率。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着研究人员越来越多地使用LLM作为写作助手，生成高质量的研究论文引言仍然具有挑战性且至关重要。需要系统评估LLM在这方面的能力。

Method: 从NAACL 2025和ICLR 2025论文中构建新数据集，评估5个最先进模型（包括开源和闭源系统），使用多维度评估框架结合自动化指标和LLM作为评判者的评估。

Result: LLaMA-4 Maverick在大多数指标上表现最优，特别是在语义相似性和忠实度方面。三样本提示方法始终优于少样本方法。

Conclusion: 研究为开发有效的研究写作助手提供了实用见解，并为LLM辅助学术写作设定了现实期望，所有代码和数据集将公开以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

TL;DR: 通过多语言激活平均法从LLM中提取概念语义，利用稀疏自编码器分离语言特异性信息，提高概念关系识别的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中语义与语法、语言特异性信息纠缠的问题，实现更纯粹的概念语义表示

Method: 使用OWL本体类生成英文文本，翻译成法文和中文，通过Gemma 2B LLM和稀疏自编码器获取概念激活，对多语言激活进行平均得到概念平均值

Result: 概念平均值比单语言激活更能准确反映本体类之间的真实关系

Conclusion: 多语言激活平均是一种有效的新技术，能够更精确地解释LLM内部网络状态的概念语义

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Method: 构建GRILE基准测试，包含来自罗马尼亚国家评估、学士学位考试和大学入学考试的1151道选择题，评估7个多语言和罗马尼亚语专用LLM的答题准确性和语言解释质量。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro达到83%准确率，但大多数开源模型低于65%，48%的解释存在事实性或教学性错误。错误分析显示在形态学和最新DOOM3拼写规范应用方面存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了低资源教育NLP的可信性挑战，GRILE为可控解释生成和评估提供了新的测试平台，所有数据、代码和演示均已公开以促进未来研究。

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合规则形态分析和统计子词分割的混合分词框架，特别针对形态丰富和黏着语言，在土耳其语上取得了最佳分词效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法（如BPE和WordPiece）主要依赖频率统计，在处理形态丰富和黏着语言时效果不佳，因为它们忽略了语言结构信息。

Method: 采用混合分词框架：结合基于规则的形态分析（音位归一化、词根-词缀词典）和统计子词分割（BPE），使用共享标识符处理音位变体，添加特殊标记处理空格和大小写。

Result: 在TR-MMLU基准测试中，该分词器实现了最高的土耳其语分词百分比（90.29%）和纯分词百分比（85.8%），相比LLaMA、Gemma和GPT的分词器产生更语言学意义明确的分词结果。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然以土耳其语为例展示，但具有语言独立性，可适配其他语言，为构建更可解释和有效的多语言NLP系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word

model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但容易产生看似合理但包含事实错误的幻觉内容，需要一种无需外部知识的实用检测和缓解方案

Method: 采用细粒度跨模型一致性检查策略，通过比较不同模型对语义等价提示的响应来发现不准确内容，并使用针对性缓解技术精确修正问题片段

Result: 在FELM数据集上幻觉检测F1分数提升6-39%，在GPQA-diamond数据集上应用Llama 4 Maverick和Claude 4 Sonnet时答案准确率提升7-8个百分点

Conclusion: Finch-Zk为生产LLM系统提供了实用的、可部署的事实可靠性保障机制，通过跨模型一致性检查有效增强输出的事实准确性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如细调模型或示例提示存在训练成本高、示例不一致导致模型调用行为错误的问题。

Method: 构建含不同函数调用行为的语料库，使用对比学习框架训练BAR，采用自定义正负对和双负对比损失来稳健检索行为一致的示例。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了错误函数调用，同时保持了高任务性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为工具增强的大语言模型提供了成本效益高的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ZPD-SCA基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在判断中文阅读理解材料与学生认知能力匹配度方面的表现，发现LLMs在零样本学习中表现不佳，但在上下文学习中有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在教育应用中显示出潜力，但其评估阅读材料与学生认知发展阶段匹配度的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在中文教育背景下缺乏针对不同年龄段学生的阅读理解难度评估研究。

Method: 引入ZPD-SCA基准测试，由60名特级教师（全国前0.15%的在职教师）进行标注，评估LLMs在零样本学习和上下文学习两种场景下的表现。

Result: LLMs在零样本学习中表现较差（Qwen-max和GLM甚至低于随机猜测概率），但在提供上下文示例后性能显著提升，部分模型准确率接近零样本基准的两倍。最佳模型仍存在系统性方向偏差，且不同体裁间性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LLMs具备评估阅读难度的新兴能力，但在教育对齐判断方面存在局限性。ZPD-SCA基准可为认知对齐教育应用中评估和改进LLMs提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在关键决策领域的部署增加，需要确保其置信度估计与实际正确性相符。现有校准方法大多需要额外监督或参数更新。

Method: 建立结构化交互循环，通过基于预测置信度与正确性对齐的反馈，结合反馈驱动提示和自然语言性能总结，动态改进模型校准。

Result: 在多个模型和游戏配置上的广泛实验显示评估指标持续改善。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的提示策略是LLM校准的有效方法，展示了通过自然语言交互实现校准的潜力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEPTH框架通过依赖感知句子简化和双层层次化精炼，有效减少LLM在关系抽取中的幻觉问题，在6个基准测试中平均幻觉率降至7.0%，F1分数提升17.2%

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注关系分类，但LLM在判断关系是否存在时容易产生幻觉，特别是在复杂句子结构和语义情况下，这会损害知识图谱的完整性和下游应用的可靠性

Method: 提出DEPTH框架，包含两个阶段：1) Grounding模块利用最短依赖路径提取关系，将句子蒸馏为最小但连贯的关系上下文；2) Refinement模块聚合所有局部预测并基于句子整体理解进行修正。还引入因果驱动的奖励模型来缓解奖励黑客问题

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DEPTH将平均幻觉率降低到7.0%，同时比最先进的基线方法平均F1分数提高了17.2%

Conclusion: DEPTH框架通过依赖感知简化和层次化精炼有效解决了LLM在关系抽取中的幻觉问题，显著提升了关系抽取的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型在个体呈现范式下难以识别自身生成文本，提出了隐式领域意识概念和认知外科框架来唤醒模型的自我识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在成对呈现范式下能可靠识别自身生成文本，但在个体呈现范式下性能急剧下降，这种现象的原因尚未被系统分析。

Method: 提出认知外科框架，包含四个主要模块：表示提取、领域构建、作者判别和认知编辑，通过唤醒模型的隐式领域意识来提升性能。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提升了三种不同大语言模型在个体呈现范式下的性能，平均准确率分别达到83.25%、66.19%和88.01%。

Conclusion: 隐式领域意识是LLMs自我识别能力的关键，认知外科框架能有效唤醒这种能力，为理解LLMs的内部表征机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model

Motivation: 当前基于transformer的规则链方法在可解释性和推理任务扩展性方面存在局限，无法支持溯因推理或矛盾识别等任务。

Result: 在三个流行的推理数据集上，该方法能够以高准确率识别和提取自然语言论证的逻辑结构。

Conclusion: RLS方法显著扩展了推理能力，支持任意深度的推理、实时错误修正和交互式讨论，同时提高了可解释性。

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

Conclusion: EmoTale是一个有效的丹麦语和英语情感语音语料库，其质量与现有DES数据集相当，自监督学习方法在情感识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based

Motivation: 南乌兹别克语虽有500万使用者，但在自然语言处理领域中表现不足，需要建立资源支持该语言的研究开发

Method: 构建997句FLORES+测试集、39,994句平行语料（来自词典、文学和网络），对NLLB-200模型进行微调，并提出阿拉伯文字半空格字符恢复的后处理方法

Result: 开发了南乌兹别克语的语料集、模型和工具，后处理方法能够改善词法边界处理，所有资源公开发布

Conclusion: 该研究为南乌兹别克语和其他低资源语言提供了重要的NLP资源支持，有助于推动这些语言的机器翻译和语言处理研究

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present
new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence
FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web
sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a
post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which
improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools
are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other
low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 提出基于概念向量投影的连续情感评分方法，用于多语言文学文本的细粒度情感分析，在英语和丹麦语文本上优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词典工具在文学文本情感分析中表现不佳，特别是对低资源语言；而Transformer模型通常输出粗粒度的分类标签，限制了细粒度分析。文学文本中的比喻语言、风格模糊性和情感唤起策略带来了独特挑战。

Method: 基于概念向量投影的连续情感评分方法，在多语言文学数据上训练，能够更有效地捕捉跨体裁、语言和历史时期的细腻情感表达。

Result: 在英语和丹麦语文本上优于现有工具，生成的情感分数分布与人类评分高度匹配，实现了更准确的分析和文学情感弧建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为文学文本情感分析提供了更有效的解决方案，特别适用于处理多语言和跨历史时期的文学作品的细腻情感表达。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

*Omar Naim,Swarnadeep Bhar,Jérôme Bolte,Nicholas Asher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为scaled signed averaging (SSA)的新评分函数来替代Softmax，解决了LLM在上下文学习中处理一阶量词和线性函数时的局限性，显著提升了相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在类比学习（上下文学习）方面表现出色，但近期研究发现其在处理一阶量词（如all、some）和线性函数的上下文学习时存在局限性。Softmax作为注意力机制中的评分函数被认为是导致这些限制的因素之一。

Method: 提出了scaled signed averaging (SSA)作为Softmax的替代方案。在编码器-解码器和仅解码器transformer模型上评估了SSA的性能，并与基于Softmax的模型进行了比较。

Result: 实证结果显示，SSA在目标任务上的性能显著提升。使用SSA的transformer模型在各种语言探测任务上的表现达到或超过了基于Softmax的对应模型。

Conclusion: SSA作为一种新的评分函数，有效解决了Softmax在特定上下文学习任务中的局限性，为改进语言模型的类比学习能力提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

TL;DR: ShizhenGPT是首个专门为中医设计的多模态大语言模型，通过构建大规模多模态数据集（文本、图像、音频、生理信号）解决了中医数据稀缺和诊断多模态特性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在中医领域应用受限，主要因为高质量中医数据稀缺以及中医诊断固有的多模态特性（望闻问切），这些感官丰富的模态超出了传统LLM的能力范围。

Method: 构建了迄今最大的中医数据集（100GB+文本和200GB+多模态数据），包括120万张图像、200小时音频和生理信号。ShizhenGPT经过预训练和指令调优，实现了深度中医知识和多模态推理能力。

Result: 实验表明ShizhenGPT在可比规模的LLM中表现优异，能与更大的专有模型竞争。在中医视觉理解方面领先现有多模态LLM，并在声音、脉搏、气味和视觉等多模态感知方面展现统一能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为中医领域的整体多模态感知和诊断开辟了新途径，数据集、模型和代码均已公开，有望推动该领域的进一步探索。

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用切词器在菜谱生成任务中无法保留关键结构和数值精度的问题，提高域特定性的生成质量。

Method: 使用细调的GPT-2大模型(774M)对比GPT-2小模型(124M)和LSTM/RNN基线，采用包含23个常用分数标记和结构标记的目标切词策略。

Result: 大型转换器模型在BERTScore(F1)上相比最佳循环基线提高20%以上(0.92 vs 0.72)，语言混淆度降低69.8%，在流畅性、连贯性、语义相关性和多样性指标上都有显著改善。

Conclusion: 该研究为菜谱生成领域打下坚实基础，虽然在事实准确性方面仍面临挑战，但为集成实际约束和多模态输入的高级研究排阵了路。

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

TL;DR: LMTransplant是一种新的文本增强方法，通过LLM的"移植-再生"策略，在保持原文核心属性的同时生成更多样化和创造性的内容级变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法主要关注词汇层面的改写，语义变化有限。LLMs虽然能通过知识涌现能力增强文本，但在控制输出风格和结构方面仍存在挑战，需要复杂的提示工程。

Method: 提出LMTransplant范式，采用"移植-再生"策略：将种子文本嵌入到LLM扩展的上下文中，然后让LLM基于扩展上下文重新生成变体版本。

Result: 在多个文本相关任务中评估显示，LMTransplant性能优于现有文本增强方法，并且在增强数据规模增长时表现出优异的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LMTransplant通过充分利用LLMs中嵌入的知识，能够生成更多样化和创造性的内容级变体，同时保持原始文本的核心属性，是一种有效的文本增强新范式。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在多语言环境下的一致性和逻辑基础对齐能力，这是当前研究中比较缺少的领域。

Method: 构建了一个受控的多语言自然语言推理评估框架，通过生成合成的逻辑基础前提-假设对，并将其翻译成语言类型学多样的语言。设计包括单语言和混合语言（代码切换）条件的测试。

Result: 代码切换不会降低性能，反而有时能提高性能，这表明翻译导致的词汇变化可能作为正则化信号。通过嵌入相似性分析和跨语言对齐可视化验证了语义保持的保真性。

Conclusion: 研究曝露了当前大语言模型跨语言推理的潜力和脆弱性，并确认代码切换为提高多语言健壮性的有望手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

TL;DR: TransLLM是一个统一的基础框架，通过可学习的提示组合将时空建模与大型语言模型集成，解决了现有方法在交通领域任务中的局限性。

Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：小规模深度学习模型任务特定且数据饥渴，限制了跨场景的泛化能力；而大型语言模型虽然通过自然语言接口提供灵活性，但在结构化时空数据和交通领域的数值推理方面存在困难。

Method: 采用轻量级时空编码器通过扩张时间卷积和双邻接图注意力网络捕获复杂依赖关系，通过结构化嵌入与LLMs无缝接口。新颖的实例级提示路由机制通过强化学习训练，基于输入特征动态个性化提示。

Result: 在7个数据集和3个任务上的实验表明，TransLLM在监督和零样本设置中都表现出卓越的有效性。与10个基线模型相比，在回归和规划问题上都提供了有竞争力的性能，显示出强大的泛化和跨任务适应性。

Conclusion: TransLLM框架成功地将时空建模与大型语言模型集成，通过动态个性化提示机制解决了交通领域多任务学习的挑战，为城市交通系统的智能化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 电子健康记录冗长、嘈杂且冗余，传统大语言模型无法处理超长临床笔记，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 提出三个可复现的临床任务，测试三种最先进LLM在不同上下文量下的表现，比较目标文本检索与最近临床笔记两种方法

Result: RAG方法性能接近或超过使用最近笔记，且接近使用完整上下文的性能，同时显著减少输入token数量

Conclusion: 即使新模型能处理更长文本，RAG仍是一种竞争性强且高效的方法

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的推理过程主要基于英语，缺乏对其他语言推理能力的系统研究。为了促进公平的多语言推理研究，需要探索长链思维推理在不同语言间的迁移效果和机制。

Method: 构建了两个流行英语推理数据集的翻译版本，对Qwen 2.5 (7B)和Qwen 3 (8B)模型进行微调，系统研究了法语、日语、拉脱维亚语和斯瓦希里语的长链思维生成。

Result: 1) 英语作为枢纽语言的效果因语言而异：对法语无益，对日语和拉脱维亚语有益，对斯瓦希里语不足；2) 多语言预训练缩小但未消除跨语言性能差距，仅用1k数据微调即可在斯瓦希里语上提升30%以上；3) 数据质量与规模的权衡具有语言依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究明确了长链思维推理跨语言迁移的条件和原因，提供了翻译数据集以促进公平的多语言推理研究，为多语言AI系统的开发提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)在自然语言生成任务中展现出潜力，但其大规模参数和高资源需求使得在边缘设备上部署困难。虽然PTQ技术已广泛应用于自回归LLMs压缩，但在dLLMs中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 识别激活异常值问题，实施最先进的PTQ方法，从四个维度(比特宽度、量化方法、任务类别、模型类型)进行综合评估。

Result: 发现激活异常值对低比特量化构成关键挑战，通过多角度评估提供了dLLMs在不同配置下的量化行为实践洞察。

Conclusion: 研究为未来高效dLLMs部署研究奠定了基础，所有代码和实验设置将开源以支持社区发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

Motivation: 研究各种Kantorovich算子的近似性能，以便在图像处理中根据图像的不均匀特性选择最合适的算子，因为不同算子在不同图像特征上表现各异。

Method: 采用样本Kantorovich(SK)、高斯、双边和阈值波级基算子进行分析，通过测量误差、均方误差(MSE)、斑点指数(SI)、斑点压制指数(SSI)等数学参数在不同分辨率水平下评估算子性能。

Result: 通过数值示例和2D Shepp-Logan幻影图像的区域分析，验证了基础近似定理(FTA)，并发现不同算子在不同图像特征上表现异常，某些算子对特定特征效果好而另一些效果差。

Conclusion: 因图像的非理想性质(非均匀特性)，各种算子在研究图像不同特征时都有其独特价值，需要根据具体应用场景选择最合适的算子。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

Method: 使用修改的FastPose模型处理自定义的工业相关手势数据集，测试LSTM和Transformer编码器两种时间背榜，并在四种训练范式下评估：集中式、本地化、联邦学习加权平均和联邦集成学习。

Result: 在全局测试集上，联邦学习Transformer比集中式训练提高了12.4%，联邦集成学习提高了16.3%。在未见的外部客户上，联邦学习和联邦集成分别超过集中式准确率52.6%和58.3%。

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅保护隐私，还显著提升了跨用户的模型通用性，是异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私意识的动作识别的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法在测试时忽略了显式的思维链推理，限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力

Method: 提出统一的强化学习奖励机制，涵盖句子级、边界框级和分割级线索，鼓励模型生成信息丰富的思维链推理同时提升掩码质量

Result: 在RefCOCO系列基准测试中平均cIoU达到81.2%，比强基线方法GLaMM提升高达5.6%

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理为文本提示分割提供了强大的先验，为构建更通用的Segment Anything模型提供了实用路径

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中物体尺度变化是一个基本挑战，同类物体可能有不同大小，且感知大小还受相机距离影响。这些变化是局部性的，即同一图像中不同物体的尺度变化可能不同

Method: 提出深度均衡规范化器(DEC)，可以轻松集成到现有网络架构中，并能适配预训练模型，提高模型的局部尺度等变性

Result: 在竞争性的ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提升了四个流行预训练深度网络(ViT、DeiT、Swin、BEiT)的模型性能和局部尺度一致性

Conclusion: DEC是一种有效的处理尺度变化的方法，能够显著提升现有模型的性能和尺度一致性

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Conclusion: CLIPSym成功利用视觉语言模型的语义理解能力来提升对称性检测性能，证明了预训练模型在几何视觉任务中的价值。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统CNN在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限，需要新的范式来处理图像中的关系数据，GCN与Voronoi图的结合提供了这种可能性

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著减少了预处理时间并提高了分类准确率，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了现有最优模型

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的整合为图像分类提供了新途径，NVGCN比常规GCN更快，为计算机视觉和非结构化数据领域的图基学习范式开辟了新方向

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了不同数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变分级中保形预测器性能的影响，发现样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）不仅能提高预测精度，还能产生更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在高风险医疗任务（如糖尿病视网膜病变分级）中需要可靠的不确定性量化。虽然保形预测能提供统计保证的预测集，但标准训练实践（如数据增强）与这些保证有效性之间的相互作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估两种骨干架构（ResNet-50和CoaT）在五种增强方案下的表现：无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix，分析对保形指标（经验覆盖率、平均预测集大小和正确效率）的下游影响。

Result: 样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。相反，CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要将增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计，以构建真正值得信赖的医疗影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital

complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [69] [Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别间空间关系的损失函数(ICR loss)，利用大物体指导小物体检测，解决了IoU损失对小物体梯度更新不足的问题，在车牌检测任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based损失函数在处理小物体时存在梯度更新不足的问题，因为小物体的IoU梯度非常平缓，导致训练过程中小物体的学习效率低下。

Method: 利用类别间的空间关系（如车牌必须依附在汽车上），当预测的小物体边界框不在其相关的大物体内部时，添加与重叠面积成反比的惩罚损失，通过大物体来指导小物体的学习。

Result: 在SVMLP数据集上，YOLOv12-T和UAV-DETR的mAP50分别提升了10.3%和1.6%，无需额外超参数调优。

Conclusion: ICR损失函数可以轻松集成到现有的IoU-based损失中，有效提升小物体检测性能，特别是利用类别间空间关系来增强深层特征图中的潜在信息。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results for the LSFB and DiSPLaY

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了一个新的微观镜图像数据集，用于自动化分析细胞对化疗药Taxol的响应，并提出了基线模型ResAttention-KNN来进行浓度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Taxol效果检测方法需要专业设备和复杂的样品处理，成本高且不适合高速通量分析。同时缺乏公开的自动化细胞形态分析数据集。

Method: 构建了C6脑研细胞经过不同Taxol浓度处理后的微视镜图像数据集。提出ResAttention-KNN基线模型，结合ResNet-50、卷积注意力模块和k近邻分类器。

Result: 创建了公开的Taxol细胞响应图像数据集，并提供了一个有效的浓度分类基线模型，为未来研究设立了标准。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Taxol自动化细胞形态分析数据集的空白，提供的数据集和模型实现将有助于推动视觉基图医学分析领域的可复现性研究。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRC-Pose是一个基于深度学习的类别级物体姿态估计框架，通过对比学习保持6D姿态连续性，在旋转和平移分量上分别处理，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中优于现有深度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有类别级物体姿态估计方法仅依赖6D姿态作为监督信号，未能显式捕捉姿态的内在连续性，导致预测不一致和对未见姿态泛化能力下降。

Method: 提出HRC-Pose深度框架，解耦物体姿态为旋转和平移分量分别编码，引入基于6D姿态感知层次排序方案的对比学习策略，设计分别处理旋转感知和平移感知嵌入的姿态估计模块。

Result: 实验表明HRC-Pose成功学习到连续特征空间，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中一致优于现有深度方法，并能实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过对比学习有效解决了姿态连续性问题，展示了在真实世界应用中的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Motivation: 解决情感可控说话人脸生成的两个关键挑战：如何有效建模与特定情感相关的多模态关系，以及如何利用这种关系合成保持身份特征的情感视频。

Method: 采用两种预训练策略解耦音频为独立组件并量化视频为视觉标记组合；提出情感锚点表示将情感信息整合到视觉标记中；使用自回归变换器建模视觉标记的全局分布并预测索引序列。

Result: 在MEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上都表现出优越性能，能够有效控制视频情感并保持身份特征。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了情感可控说话人脸生成的关键问题，通过离散化处理和情感锚点表示实现了高质量的情感视频合成，为多模态情感建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用的多目标跟踪框架，特别针对复杂交通场景中的车辆跟踪，包含遮挡感知重识别和道路结构感知轨迹优化，并在新基准和公开数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪系统主要针对行人跟踪，对其他物体类别的泛化能力有限，需要开发能够处理多种物体类型的通用跟踪框架。

Method: 方法包含两个关键组件：(1)遮挡感知重识别机制，增强对被严重遮挡物体的身份保持；(2)道路结构感知轨迹优化策略，利用车道方向、人行横道、道路边界等语义场景先验来改善轨迹连续性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于通用的多类跟踪，在传统基准测试中也表现出色，证明了其在通用目标跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的粗到细点运动网络(TCFNet)，用于正颌手术规划中的密集面骨点云变换，通过两阶段网络结构解决传统方法和现有深度学习方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物力学模拟方法计算耗时、数据处理繁琐且精度低，现有深度学习方法无法处理大规模点云、感受野有限导致噪声点，且需要复杂的预处理和后处理操作。

Method: 采用端到端框架，第一阶段使用Transformer网络，第二阶段使用局部信息聚合网络(LIA-Net)，两者相互增强生成精确点运动路径。LIA-Net通过建模局部几何结构补偿Transformer网络的邻域精度损失，并利用门控循环单元引导局部位移。

Result: 在收集的数据集上与现有最先进方法相比，TCFNet获得了优异的评估指标和可视化结果。

Conclusion: TCFNet能够有效学习面骨点云变换的复杂对应关系，为计算机辅助手术模拟提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法通过复杂激活函数来缓解频谱偏差，但带来了显著的硬件开销问题。

Method: 提出QuadINR方法，使用分段二次激活函数，利用其傅里叶级数中的丰富谐波内容来增强高频信号表达能力，并通过NTK分析验证。开发了统一的N级流水线框架来实现各种激活函数的高效硬件实现。

Result: 在图像和视频实验中，QuadINR相比现有方法PSNR提升达2.06dB，面积仅1914μm²，动态功耗6.14mW，资源消耗降低97%，功耗降低97%，延迟改善93%。

Conclusion: QuadINR在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了硬件开销，为隐式神经表示的硬件实现提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by
up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着空间转录组技术分辨率不断提高（如Visium HD达到8um），传统逐点回归方法变得低效且不稳定，高分辨率ST数据的极端稀疏性和低表达水平也给预测和评估带来了挑战。

Method: 提出Img2ST-Net框架，将HD ST数据建模为超像素表示，将图像到组学推断任务重新表述为具有数百或数千个输出通道的超内容图像生成问题，采用全卷积架构并行生成密集的HD基因表达图谱。

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为大规模高效准确的空间转录组推断提供了原则性解决方案，为下一代稳健且分辨率感知的ST建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

TL;DR: CTA-Flux是一种适配器方法，通过多模态扩散变换器直接控制Flux主干网络，使英文训练的文本生成图像模型能够更好地理解和生成中文语义内容，显著提升图像质量和文化真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux等基于英文语料训练的文本生成图像模型在处理非英文提示词时表现不佳，特别是由于训练数据中的语言和文化偏见。现有方法如翻译或双语微调无法充分处理文化特定语义，影响图像真实性和质量。

Method: 采用MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT)直接控制Flux主干网络，而不是使用类似ControlNet的架构。这种方法显著减少了参数量，同时增强了对中文语义的理解能力。

Result: 实证评估表明CTA-Flux支持中英文提示词，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义忠实度方面都表现出色，同时保持与现有插件的兼容性。

Conclusion: CTA-Flux通过创新的适配器方法有效解决了英文中心TTI模型对中文语义理解不足的问题，在不完全重新训练模型的情况下显著提升了生成图像的文化真实性和质量。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Motivation: 现有的去摩尔纹方法在处理空间变化强度、大尺度结构、通道依赖统计和时序波动等方面存在局限，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出MoCHA-former模型，包含解耦摩尔纹自适应去摩尔纹(DMAD)和时空自适应去摩尔纹(STAD)两个核心组件，使用Moiré Decoupling Block分离摩尔纹和内容，通过Moiré Conditioning Block进行针对性恢复，并引入空间融合块和特征通道注意力来处理大尺度结构和通道依赖性。

Result: 在两个视频数据集(RAW和sRGB域)上的评估显示，MoCHA-former在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上均超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过创新的解耦和自适应机制，有效解决了相机拍摄屏幕时摩尔纹去除的多个挑战性问题，在定量和定性评估中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过结合扩散模型和超图卷积网络，有效提升了复杂姿态下的3D人体姿态估计精度，具有良好的实用性和适应性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种基于频率调节的扩散驱动输入适应方法，通过在去噪过程中保持任务相关的语义信息来解决测试时适应中的知识遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时适应方法在平衡领域迁移适应和任务相关知识保持方面存在挑战，适应领域迁移可能导致任务相关知识的遗忘。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，使用训练好的轻量级Y形频率预测网络(Y-FPN)从噪声图像中分离高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强方法，在扩散驱动框架中通过频率先验条件化反向步骤来保持语义信息。

Result: 在15种损坏类型和三个数据集上的语义分割和单目深度估计任务中达到了最先进的平均性能，并能通过FOCUS去噪图像生成伪标签来补充现有模型适应方法。

Conclusion: FOCUS有效解决了测试时适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，不仅能提升独立性能，还能通过伪标签监督增强现有模型适应方法的性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

TL;DR: MUSE是一个统一的文本到图像合成框架，通过串联交叉注意力机制实现布局可控的多主体合成，解决了现有方法在空间精度和身份保持方面的双重挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在多主体组合合成中难以同时实现精确的空间控制和身份保持，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出MUSE框架，采用串联交叉注意力(CCA)机制将布局规范与文本指导无缝集成，通过显式语义空间扩展实现双向模态对齐，并使用渐进式两阶段训练策略分解学习目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，MUSE能够实现零样本端到端生成，在空间准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有解决方案，推进了可控图像合成的前沿。

Conclusion: MUSE通过创新的CCA机制和训练策略，成功解决了布局可控多主体合成的关键挑战，为可控图像合成提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: 农业场景存在光照不均、遮挡和视野受限等独特挑战，现有3D高斯泼溅方法在农业领域应用不足，需要多模态数据来增强鲁棒性和植物学洞察

Method: 创建包含NIR、RGB、文本元数据、深度和LiDAR的多模态数据集；提出NIRSplat架构，使用跨注意力机制和3D点位置编码，整合多种模态数据

Conclusion: 通过整合NIR数据和植被指数等元数据，显著提升了农业场景3D重建的鲁棒性和上下文理解能力，为农业应用提供了有效的多模态解决方案

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Method: 提出域提示机制（可学习域特定向量）和并行交叉注意力模块（对齐前向和后向BiLSTM状态）

Result: 在多个跨文化跨语言基准上达到SOTA，NoXi-J测试集CCC提升0.45，获得MultiMediate'25挑战赛第一名

Conclusion: DAPA框架有效提升了对话参与度估计的跨域泛化能力和交互动态建模效果

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

TL;DR: D^3-Talker提出了一种新颖的3D说话头合成方法，通过构建静态3D高斯属性场并利用音频和面部运动信号独立控制两个不同的高斯属性变形场，实现通用变形和个性化变形的解耦，在有限训练数据下实现高质量渲染和准确的音频-唇部同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D说话头合成方法需要大量训练视频且难以处理音频中与唇部运动无关的信息，导致在少量训练帧下唇部同步效果差和图像质量不佳的问题。

Method: 构建静态3D高斯属性场，使用音频和面部运动信号分别控制两个独立的变形场；设计相似性对比损失函数实现更彻底的解耦；集成粗到细模块优化渲染图像质量。

Result: 大量实验表明D^3-Talker在有限训练数据下，在高保真渲染和准确的音频-唇部同步方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦变形预测和图像细化，有效解决了小样本3D说话头合成的挑战，实现了更好的视觉效果和同步精度。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Ouroboros框架通过单步扩散模型和循环一致性机制，有效解决了正向和逆向渲染的协同问题，在性能和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Motivation: 传统统计和数据驱动方法依赖大量标注数据且适应性有限，基础模型的感知能力为工业异常检测提供了新机遇

Method: 利用基础模型的多模态和推理能力，设计专门提示模板集成领域知识，包含预处理模块将用户输入转换为有效系统提示

Conclusion: PB-IAD框架通过语义指令实现高性能异常检测，特别适合动态生产环境中的数据稀疏场景，具有用户友好和灵活定制特点

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

Result: 在VBench指标和新提出的DreamSwapV-Benchmark上的综合实验验证，DreamSwapV优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamSwapV提供了一个有效的视频主题替换解决方案，通过多条件融合和自适应掩码策略实现了高质量的主题定制化替换。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing

Conclusion: Vivid-VR通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，有效解决了视频修复中的分布漂移问题，显著提升了生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

Conclusion: UST-SSM成功将SSM扩展到点云视频，解决了时空无序性问题，为点云视频动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is

TL;DR: SATURN是一个轻量级的文本到图像生成模型扩展，通过将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，在保持VAR-CLIP主干网络冻结的情况下，仅微调VAR变换器，显著提升了复杂提示下的布局和对象关系准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在照片级渲染方面表现出色，但在处理复杂提示的布局和对象关系时存在困难。场景图提供了自然的结构先验，但之前的图引导方法依赖于繁重的GAN或扩散管道，在速度和保真度方面落后于现代自回归架构。

Method: SATURN是VAR-CLIP的轻量级扩展，将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，使冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干能够解释图结构，同时仅微调VAR变换器。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，SATURN将FID从56.45%降低到21.62%，将Inception Score从16.03提高到24.78，优于SG2IM和SGDiff等先前方法，且无需额外模块或多阶段训练。

Conclusion: SATURN有效地将结构感知与最先进的自回归保真度相结合，在对象计数保真度和空间关系准确性方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art

TL;DR: ScenGE是一个通过大语言模型生成安全关键场景的框架，能够推理新颖的对抗性案例并用复杂交通流进行放大，相比现有方法能发现更多严重碰撞案例


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶安全评估主要依赖预定义的威胁模式或基于规则的策略，难以暴露多样化和不可预见的故障模式，需要更有效的场景生成方法

Method: 采用Meta-Scenario Generation使用大语言模型推理对抗性agent行为，然后通过Complex Scenario Evolution使用背景车辆放大核心威胁，构建对抗协作图优化关键agent轨迹

Result: 在多个基于强化学习的AV模型上实验显示，ScenGE比最先进基线平均多发现31.96%的严重碰撞案例，且能应用于大模型AV系统，对抗训练可提升模型鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该框架生成的场景既合理又关键，通过真实世界车辆测试和人类评估验证，为建立公众信任和确保安全部署迈出了关键一步

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE是一个自适应全玻片图像编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域，将编码时间减少三倍以上，同时保持或超越全量处理的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全玻片图像（WSI）由于千兆像素级的规模，需要处理数万到数十万个高分辨率图像块，导致预处理和训练时间长达数天甚至数周，成为实际部署中的主要瓶颈。

Method: WISE-FUSE利用病理领域视觉语言模型和大语言模型，首先通过知识蒸馏机制计算低分辨率图像块与类别特定文本描述的相似度分数，基于这些分数选择信息丰富的区域子集进行高分辨率编码，并与文本嵌入融合以增强诊断上下文。

Result: 广泛实验表明，WISE-FUSE将WSI编码时间减少了三倍以上，同时实现了与全量图像块处理相当或更优的诊断性能。

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE为计算病理学提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，有效解决了全玻片图像编码的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车载摄像头拍摄的车牌图像因低分辨率、运动模糊和眩光等问题导致的识别困难，现有生成模型无法可靠恢复此类低质量图像

Method: 使用先进的光流估计器进行帧对齐，设计算法检测和校正错误的光流估计，利用车牌图像序列的时空一致性

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上显著优于8个最新恢复模型，识别准确率达到86.44%，远超单帧LPR(14.04%)和多帧LPR(82.55%)

Conclusion: MF-LPR²框架通过多帧信息聚合有效解决了低质量车牌图像的恢复和识别问题，同时保持了输入图像的证据内容完整性

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用文档内字符形状冗余的无监督OCR后处理方法，通过扩展高斯混合模型和统计测试来校正OCR输出并改进聚类效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OCR系统在处理低质量文档时表现不佳，特别是印刷文档的域间变异性高而域内变异性低，未能充分利用文档内部的冗余信息

Method: 使用扩展高斯混合模型(GMM)，交替执行期望最大化(EM)算法和簇内重新对齐过程，结合正态性统计测试来校正OCR输出

Result: 在多种退化程度的文档上验证有效，包括乌拉圭军事档案和17-20世纪欧洲报纸等历史文献

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用文档内部字符形状的冗余性，提升低质量文档的OCR识别精度

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Motivation: 现有的学习型医学图像配准方法需要大量训练数据，限制了临床采用。为了克服这一限制，需要开发无需训练的方法

Method: 使用冻结的DINOv3编码器提取特征，在测试时通过优化特征空间中的变形场来实现图像配准，无需额外训练

Result: 在腹部MR-CT配准中达到最佳Dice分数0.790，最低HD95距离4.9±5.0，最低SDLogJ 0.08±0.02；在ACDC心脏MRI中DSC提升至0.769，SDLogJ降至0.11，HD95降至4.8

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间中进行测试时优化，为无需额外训练的临床配准提供了实用且通用的解决方案

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法无法同时提供定制化的光照控制并保持内容完整性，特别是在从参考图像向目标图像迁移复杂光照效果方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用两个微调的扩散模型进行生成式解耦，准确分离图像内容和光照效果，构建百万级图像-内容-光照三元组数据集；采用IC-Light作为生成模型，将参考光照图像作为额外条件信号进行训练。

Result: TransLight成功实现了跨不同图像的光照效果迁移，提供了比现有技术更定制化的光照控制，在光照和谐化和编辑方面开辟了新方向。

Conclusion: 该方法通过彻底解耦参考图像中的光照效果，赋予TransLight高度灵活的光照控制能力，为实际光照风格化需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Method: 使用残差向量量化(RVQ)技术，在离散姿态码潜在表示上增加连续运动特征，保持可解释性和可操控性的同时抓取细微运动特征。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，FID指标从0.041降到0.015，Top-1 R-Precision从0.508提升到0.510，定性分析证明了运动编辑的可控制性。

Conclusion: 方法有效结合了姿态码的优点和连续特征的表达能力，显著提升了文本到运动生成的质量和控制性。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Method: 为每个概念分配一个原型，通过学习使原型编码相似局部区域，利用基础模型确保原型与相关概念的相关性，用原型辅助学习识别每个概念应预测的正确局部区域

Result: 实验结果表明LCBM能有效识别图像中的存在概念，在保持可比分类性能的同时展现出改进的定位能力

Conclusion: LCBM框架通过原型学习和基础模型利用，成功解决了概念定位问题，实现了准确的空间概念定位

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal

future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Conclusion: GOGS框架有效解决了高光物体逆向渲染中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的几何和材质重建，为复杂光照条件下的真实感渲染提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Conclusion: HistAug提供了一种快速高效的增强方法，能够显著提升MIL模型性能，特别是在数据稀缺场景下，同时保持了变换的语义控制能力

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 烟雾呈现复杂的时空动力学特征，受照明变化、流动动力学和环境噪声影响，传统检测器可靠性低，需要高保真度早期预警系统

Method: 提出双阶段不确定性知识Shifted Windows Transformer框架：1)使用四色定理受启的双相水平零分段变分模型进行光流估计；2)通过高斯混合模型融合外观线索；3)多尺度不确定性估计头进行两阶段学习

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了视觉提示方法在增量目标检测(IOD)中的应用，发现在复杂域增量学习设置下，单纯的提示方法表现不佳，但与少量数据回放结合后能获得最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉提示方法在增量图像分类中表现出色，但尚未有研究将其应用于增量目标检测，需要验证其通用性和有效性。

Method: 在复杂域增量学习设置下分析三种不同的提示方法，并与多种基线方法进行比较，同时测试提示长度和初始化策略。

Result: 测试的提示方法在该设置下表现不佳，但将视觉提示与少量先前数据回放相结合的方法获得了最佳结果。

Conclusion: 研究为推进提示方法在增量目标检测中的应用提供了有价值的见解，表明结合数据回放是有效的实践策略。

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMTrack是首个直接在标准RGB视频上进行端到端多目标跟踪的深度SNN框架，通过自适应尺度感知的归一化Wasserstein距离损失和TrackTrack身份模块，在多个数据集上达到与ANN方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然脉冲神经网络(SNN)在低功耗计算方面具有巨大潜力，但目前在视觉任务中的应用主要局限于图像分类、目标检测和事件跟踪，而在传统RGB视频流中直接训练的SNN在复杂时序任务如多目标跟踪方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SMTrack框架，包含：1) 自适应尺度感知归一化Wasserstein距离损失(Asa-NWDLoss)，通过计算训练批次中平均目标大小并动态调整归一化因子来提升小目标检测性能；2) TrackTrack身份模块用于关联阶段，保持目标轨迹的鲁棒性和一致性。

Result: 在BEE24、MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛评估表明，SMTrack达到了与领先的ANN基MOT方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: SMTrack推进了在复杂场景中基于SNN的鲁棒准确跟踪技术，为SNN在RGB视频多目标跟踪任务中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频编辑面临维持全局一致性和时间连贯性的挑战，现有方法在分钟级序列中容易出现结构漂移或时间伪影。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，将任务解耦为稀疏锚点帧编辑和中间帧插值，通过渐进去噪过程强制结构一致性，并利用多模态指导保持时间动态。

Result: 大量实验表明，AnchorSync能够产生连贯、高保真度的编辑效果，在视觉质量和时间稳定性方面超越先前方法。

Conclusion: AnchorSync通过创新的解耦方法和多模态指导，有效解决了长视频编辑中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的长时视频编辑。

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

TL;DR: PerSense是一个无需训练、模型无关的单样本密集图像实例分割框架，通过密度图生成候选点提示并过滤假阳性。PerSense++增强版本增加了多样性感知范例选择、混合提示生成和无关掩码拒绝模块，在密集场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集视觉场景中的分割面临遮挡、背景杂乱和尺度变化等挑战，需要开发专门的处理方法来提高实例分割在密集环境中的性能。

Method: 使用Instance Detection Module通过密度图生成实例级候选点提示，Point Prompt Selection Module通过自适应阈值和空间门控过滤假阳性。PerSense++增加了多样性感知范例选择、混合IDM（结合轮廓和峰值提示生成）以及Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module。

Conclusion: PerSense框架为密集图像中的个性化实例分割提供了有效的解决方案，PerSense++通过额外的增强组件进一步提高了在杂乱场景中的鲁棒性，并为此任务建立了专用基准数据集PerSense-D。

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS是一个处理严重运动模糊图像的3D高斯泼溅框架，无需依赖清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，通过深度学习SfM和概率分布建模实现直接从模糊输入重建场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在严重运动模糊情况下是不现实的假设，COLMAP初始化方法也会因特征对应不可靠而失败。

Method: 整合VGGSfM深度学习SfM管道、3DGS-MCMC概率分布建模初始化、相机轨迹与高斯参数联合优化，以及GeMS-E版本的事件去模糊渐进细化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，是首个直接从严重模糊输入处理极端运动模糊的3DGS框架。

Conclusion: GeMS框架成功解决了从极端运动模糊图像直接进行3D重建的挑战，无需依赖清晰图像，为处理严重模糊场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于模型驱动的方法，通过联合知识转移和保持来训练视觉基础模型，避免了对大规模标签数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决以数据为中心方法开发视觉基础模型所需的大规模高质量标签数据和高端GPU资源问题，充分利用现有开源领域特定模型的知识价值。

Method: 在共享隐藏空间中统一多个领域特定的领域模型，通过知识保持策略和adapter模块集成一个通用模型的知识，避免分布差异导致的知识转移不均衡问题。

Result: 在四个核心视觉任务（图像分类、目标检测、语义分割和实例分割）上超过了现有的数据为中心模型，能够提供可通用的视觉特征并同时支持多个下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过统一和聚合现有模型，可以在不需大规模标签数据训练的情况下构建功能强大的通用视觉基础模型，继承各专业模型的知识优势。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

*Jiaxin Wei,Stefan Leutenegger,Simon Schaefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSFix3D是一个新颖框架，通过将扩散模型的先验知识蒸馏到3D表示中，改善3D高斯溅射在极端视角或部分观测区域的渲染质量，同时保持与观测场景细节的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在新视角合成方面有显著进展，但在极端新视角或部分观测区域生成高质量渲染仍具挑战性。扩散模型具有强大的生成能力，但依赖文本提示且缺乏特定场景信息感知，阻碍了准确的3D重建任务。

Method: 提出GSFix3D框架，核心是GSFixer（通过定制微调协议获得的潜在扩散模型），可同时利用网格和3D高斯来适应不同重建方法的环境和伪影类型。还提出随机掩码增强策略，使GSFixer能够合理修复缺失区域。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，GSFix3D和GSFixer实现了最先进的性能，仅需在捕获数据上进行最少的场景特定微调。真实世界测试进一步证实其对潜在姿态错误的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D通过将扩散模型先验知识与3D表示相结合，有效解决了3D高斯溅射在约束不足区域的视觉保真度问题，为未见相机姿态提供了鲁棒的新视角修复能力。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像具有传感器特异性和照明特异性，导致在不同传感器和照明条件下需要重复采集数据。需要开发能够进行照明增强和传感器映射的方法来减轻数据采集负担。

Method: 构建了首个这类数据集，包含390种照明条件、4种相机和18个场景。使用可调光谱的自定义光箱进行采集。提出了轻量级神经网络方法来实现照明增强和传感器映射。

Result: 方法在照明和传感器映射任务上超过了竞争方法。在神经ISP训练任务上也证明了其应用价值。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决RAW图像的传感器和照明特异性问题提供了有效的方法，通过轻量级网络实现了高效的照明增强和传感器映射，显著减轻了深度学习方法对大量数据采集的依赖。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依靠单纯AIS系统获取船舶位置信息时遇到的设备可靠性、数据操控和传输延迟等问题

Method: 使用YOLOX-X对象检测网络从RGB图像中检测船舶，然后通过对比同体素法（homography）和视点-n-点方法（PnP）将AIS数据与图像坐标对齐，生成3D边界框表示6D姿势

Result: PnP方法比同体素法抛影误差显著降低，YOLOX-X模型在IoU阈值0.5时达到0.80 mAP，成功创建包含3753张图像的BONK-pose数据集

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动生成高质量的6D姿势估计数据集，为海上船舶监测和姿势估计领域提供了新的数据解决方案

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Motivation: 传统相机在高速运动场景下存在帧率限制和运动模糊问题，而事件相机具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围的优势，但RGB相机在单次姿态估计方面更具优势

Method: 提出事件光流算法进行物体运动测量，实现6-DoF速度跟踪器，将跟踪的速度与低频全局姿态估计器输出的姿态进行积分融合

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上测试验证，证明方法在高速运动场景下的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了事件相机和RGB相机的各自优势，有效解决了高速物体6-DoF姿态跟踪的挑战

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的对抗框架有效缓解了医院偏差，医院检测和特征空间可视化分析进一步证实了方法的有效性，为病理基础模型的临床部署提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Motivation: 现有技术需要大量逐场景优化来确保多视角一致性或生成一致的编辑输入视图，Tinker旨在从少量图像实现鲁棒的多视角一致编辑

Method: 包含两个核心组件：(1)参考多视角编辑器实现精确的参考驱动编辑；(2)任意视角到视频合成器利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验进行高质量场景补全和新视角生成

Result: 在编辑、新视角合成和渲染增强任务上达到最先进性能，显著降低了通用3D内容创建的障碍

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展、零样本3D编辑迈出的关键一步

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频-文本检索框架，通过细粒度特征学习和推理管道改进性能，无需额外训练即可显著提升检索准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流媒体爆炸式增长带来高精度和低训练成本的挑战，现有方法依赖大规模预训练导致计算需求大，且视频文本的细粒度信息未被充分探索

Method: 采用粗到细的目标函数理解视频-文本对的语义信息，包括对比学习和匹配学习；通过粒度感知表示模块获取细粒度训练数据；提出包含投票机制和匹配熵度量的推理管道

Result: 在四个基准测试中优于先前方法，推理管道在MSR-VTT数据集上Recall@1提升2.1%，在DiDeMo数据集上提升1.6%

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度特征学习和创新的推理管道有效提升了视频-文本检索性能，同时避免了额外的预训练成本

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在道路分割中存在延迟高和计算量大的问题，事件相机提供了低功耗感知的替代方案，但缺乏预训练权重和标注数据

Method: 使用纯事件计算和概率注意力机制，采用基于事件的自监督学习来避免对大量标注数据的依赖

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上实现了最先进的性能，仅需极少量标注事件数据

Conclusion: EventSSEG方法充分利用了事件相机的优势，有效解决了事件标注数据稀缺的问题，为自动驾驶提供了低延迟、低计算的道路分割解决方案

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Motivation: 理解腿脂的变化对于检测类型2糖尿病和其他腿脂疾病至关重要，需要建立腿脂大小和形状的正常老化趋势作为参考基准。

Method: 分析了3533名患者的腹部CT或MRI扫描，使用自动化方法分割腿脂并提取13个形态特征。通过比较CT和MRI测量结果，建立正常形态模式，并使用GAMLSS回归模型分析类型2糖尿病对腿脂形态的影响。

Result: 在调整混杂因素后，13个形态特征中有10个在类型2糖尿病患者中显示出显著不同的老化趋势（p < 0.05），证实腿脂在糖尿病患者中更小。MRI与CT的测量结果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了腿脂在类型2糖尿病中的形态改变证据，确认腿脂体积缩小，并建立了大规模临床正常腿脂形态参考数据库。

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

Motivation: 现有基于骨架的动作识别对比学习方法仅依赖单一骨架结构，限制了在不同数据集间的泛化能力，无法处理多样化的关节结构和解剖学覆盖

Method: 提出MS-CLR自监督框架，从同一序列中提取多个骨架结构并对其姿态表示进行对齐，采用统一的表示方案适配ST-GCN架构处理不同关节布局和尺度的骨架

Conclusion: 多骨架对比学习能够有效学习结构不变性和捕捉多样解剖学线索，产生更具表达力和泛化能力的特征表示

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Conclusion: 统一的关节化表示在可扩展物理建模方面具有巨大潜力，能够有效处理复杂多部件关节物体的重建问题，为数字孪生和交互环境建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

Conclusion: 该算法在该场景下达到了最优性能，显著提升了枚举时序k-核的效率

Abstract: We address the problem of enumerating all temporal k-cores given a query time
range and a temporal graph, which suffers from poor efficiency and scalability
in the state-of-the-art solution. Motivated by an existing concept called core
times, we propose a novel algorithm to compute all temporal $k$-cores based on
core times and prove that the algorithmic running time is bounded by the size
of all resulting temporal k-cores, which is optimal in this scenario.
Meanwhile, we show that the cost of computing core times is much lower, which
demonstrates the close relevance between our overall running time and the
result size.

Conclusion: 本文成功解决了HIN中带大小约束的社区搜索问题，提出的算法框架和优化技术能够有效处理这一NP难问题，为实际应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of community search in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is
to identify a set of closely related target nodes that includes a query target
node. In practice, a size constraint is often imposed due to limited resources,
which has been overlooked by most existing HIN community search works. In this
paper, we introduce the size-bounded community search problem to HIN data.
Specifically, we propose a refined (k, P)-truss model to measure community
cohesiveness, aiming to identify the most cohesive community of size s that
contains the query node. We prove that this problem is NP-hard. To solve this
problem, we develop a novel B\&B framework that efficiently generates target
node sets of size s. We then tailor novel bounding, branching, total ordering,
and candidate reduction optimisations, which enable the framework to
efficiently lead to an optimum result. We also design a heuristic algorithm
leveraging structural properties of HINs to efficiently obtain a high-quality
initial solution, which serves as a global lower bound to further enhance the
above optimisations. Building upon these, we propose two exact algorithms that
enumerate combinations of edges and nodes, respectively. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed methods.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了完整的溯源多项式理论实现，具有数据库无关性，支持复杂查询操作，在性能和扩展性方面表现优异

Abstract: In today's data-driven ecosystems, ensuring data integrity, traceability and
accountability is important. Provenance polynomials constitute a powerful
formalism for tracing the origin and the derivations made to produce database
query results. Despite their theoretical expressiveness, current
implementations have limitations in handling aggregations and nested queries,
and some of them and tightly coupled to a single Database Management System
(DBMS), hindering interoperability and broader applicability.
  This paper presents a query rewriting-based approach for annotating
Structured Query Language (SQL) queries with provenance polynomials. The
proposed methods are DBMS-independent and support
Select-Projection-Join-Union-Aggregation (SPJUA) operations and nested queries,
through recursive propagation of provenance annotations. This constitutes the
first full implementation of semiring-based theory for provenance polynomials
extended with semimodule structures. It also presents an experimental
evaluation to assess the validity of the proposed methods and compare the
performance against state-of-the-art systems using benchmark data and queries.
The results indicate that our solution delivers a comprehensive implementation
of the theoretical formalisms proposed in the literature, and demonstrates
improved performance and scalability, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: 证明了有限可见度机器人群体能够在异步环境下有效部署形成最小顶点覆盖，为分布式机器人系统的图覆盖问题提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility,
it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices
satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper
affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite
visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal
vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special
vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially.
Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of
vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous
($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the
\emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for
general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We
establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time
complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one
for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for
multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the
number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on
trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present
two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors
with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.

Conclusion: 成功将可审计性扩展到多写入者寄存器和其他共享对象，提供了高效的实现方案，并建立了与其他访问控制对象的关系，增强了数据审计的实用性。

Abstract: Auditability allows to track operations performed on a shared object,
recording who accessed which information. This gives data owners more control
on their data. Initially studied in the context of single-writer registers,
this work extends the notion of auditability to other shared objects, and
studies their properties.
  We start by moving from single-writer to multi-writer registers, and provide
an implementation of an auditable $n$-writer $m$-reader read / write register,
with $O(n+m)$ step complexity. This implementation uses $(m+n)$-sliding
registers, which have consensus number $m+n$. We show that this consensus
number is necessary. The implementation extends naturally to support an
auditable load-linked / store-conditional (LL/SC) shared object. LL/SC is a
primitive that supports efficient implementation of many shared objects.
Finally, we relate auditable registers to other access control objects, by
implementing an anti-flickering deny list from auditable registers.

Motivation: 旨在建立不依赖于逻辑或类型理论的数学基础，以"有限序列"为核心概念，为数学和计算提供新的公理化基础。

Method: 开发空间理论，通过自同态半环研究空间，从纯数据底物中"有机生长"出各种数学对象，包括自然数、整数、有理数、布尔空间、矩阵代数等。

Conclusion: 该框架为数学和计算提供了新的基础方向，展示了从纯数据中构建丰富数学结构的潜力，为理论和探索开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In a previous work, "pure data" is proposed as an axiomatic foundation for
mathematics and computing, based on "finite sequence" as the foundational
concept rather than based on logic or type. Within this framework, objects with
mathematical meaning are "data" and collections of mathematical objects must
then be associative data, called a "space." A space is then the basic
collection in this framework analogous to sets in Set Theory or objects in
Category Theory. A theory of spaces is developed,where spaces are studied via
their semiring of endomorphisms. To illustrate these concepts, and as a way of
exploring the implications of the framework, pure data spaces are "grown
organically" from the substrate of pure data with minimal combinatoric
definitions. Familiar objects from classical mathematics emerge this way,
including natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, boolean spaces, matrix
algebras, Gaussian Integers, Quaternions, and non-associative algebras like the
Integer Octonions. Insights from these examples are discussed with a view
towards new directions in theory and new exploration.

Conclusion: SSSP-Del算法成功解决了动态图SSSP查询的挑战，能够高效处理大规模动态图中的边变化并提供低延迟查询

Abstract: Modern graphs are both large and dynamic, presenting significant challenges
for fundamental queries, such as the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
problem. Naively recomputing the SSSP tree after each topology change is
prohibitively expensive, causing on-demand computation to suffer from high
latency. Existing dynamic SSSP algorithms often cannot simultaneously handle
both edge additions and deletions, operate in distributed memory, and provide
low-latency query results. To address these challenges, this paper presents
SSSP-Del, a new vertex-centric, asynchronous, and fully distributed algorithm
for dynamic SSSP. Operating in a shared-nothing architecture, our algorithm
processes streams of both edge insertions and deletions. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation on large real-world and synthetic graphs with millions
of vertices, and provide a thorough analysis by evaluating result latency,
solution stability, and throughput.

Abstract: Blockchain networks offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability
for managing critical data but encounter scalability problems as the number of
network members and transaction issuers grows. Sharding is considered a
promising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing
blockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of
availability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data
unavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded
blockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of
multiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local
chain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism
across multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph
(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable
efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or
cross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively
executes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high
parallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,
PyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions
in the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to
mitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to
lower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,
demonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and
2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical
sharded blockchain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种支付通道网络(PCN)的拓扑设计和交易路由优化算法，通过O(p)近似算法最小化通道创建成本和交易拒绝成本，并在特定条件下将近似比提升至O(√p)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支付通道网络虽然能缓解区块链可扩展性问题，但需要精心设计网络拓扑以最大化交易吞吐量，同时用户需要做出最优的交易转发决策来延长通道寿命

Method: 考虑p个参与方的交易序列，设计PCN拓扑和通道容量，为每个交易做出接受或拒绝决策。提出O(p)近似算法，在特定交易分布假设下将近似比降至O(√p)

Result: 开发了理论近似算法，并通过在闪电网络环境下的实证研究验证了假设和方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该工作为PCN拓扑设计和交易路由提供了有效的近似算法解决方案，能够显著降低运营成本并提高网络效率

Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising technology that alleviates
blockchain scalability by shifting the transaction load from the blockchain to
the PCN. Nevertheless, the network topology has to be carefully designed to
maximise the transaction throughput in PCNs. Additionally, users in PCNs also
have to make optimal decisions on which transactions to forward and which to
reject to prolong the lifetime of their channels. In this work, we consider an
input sequence of transactions over $p$ parties. Each transaction consists of a
transaction size, source, and target, and can be either accepted or rejected
(entailing a cost). The goal is to design a PCN topology among the $p$
cooperating parties, along with the channel capacities, and then output a
decision for each transaction in the sequence to minimise the cost of creating
and augmenting channels, as well as the cost of rejecting transactions. Our
main contribution is an $\mathcal{O}(p)$ approximation algorithm for the
problem with $p$ parties. We further show that with some assumptions on the
distribution of transactions, we can reduce the approximation ratio to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{p})$. We complement our theoretical analysis with an
empirical study of our assumptions and approach in the context of the Lightning
Network.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该研究分析了科学工作流的碳排放问题，展示了碳感知工作流执行的潜力，通过时间转移和资源缩放等方法可显著减少碳排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学工作流通常计算密集且运行时间长，导致大量能源消耗和碳排放，但现有碳感知计算方法很少专门针对科学工作流，而科学工作流具有延迟容忍、可中断、可扩展和异构等特点，为碳感知计算提供了重要机会

Method: 使用平均和边际碳强度数据估算七个真实Nextflow工作流在不同集群基础设施上的碳足迹，系统评估碳感知时间转移、暂停恢复工作流的影响，应用资源缩放到工作流和工作流任务

Result: 时间转移能够减少超过80%的碳排放，资源缩放能够减少67%的碳排放

Conclusion: 科学工作流的碳感知执行具有巨大潜力，时间转移和资源缩放是有效的碳减排策略，可为科学计算提供更环保的解决方案

Abstract: Scientific workflows are widely used to automate scientific data analysis and
often involve computationally intensive processing of large datasets on compute
clusters. As such, their execution tends to be long-running and
resource-intensive, resulting in substantial energy consumption and, depending
on the energy mix, carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a wealth of carbon-aware
computing methods have been proposed, yet little work has focused specifically
on scientific workflows, even though they present a substantial opportunity for
carbon-aware computing because they are often significantly delay tolerant,
efficiently interruptible, highly scalable and widely heterogeneous. In this
study, we first exemplify the problem of carbon emissions associated with
running scientific workflows, and then show the potential for carbon-aware
workflow execution. For this, we estimate the carbon footprint of seven
real-world Nextflow workflows executed on different cluster infrastructures
using both average and marginal carbon intensity data. Furthermore, we
systematically evaluate the impact of carbon-aware temporal shifting, and the
pausing and resuming of the workflow. Moreover, we apply resource scaling to
workflows and workflow tasks. Finally, we report the potential reduction in
overall carbon emissions, with temporal shifting capable of decreasing
emissions by over 80%, and resource scaling capable of decreasing emissions by
67%.

Motivation: 现有的DAG-based拜占庭原子广播协议通常依赖可靠广播和公共硬币原语，这些原语会增加协议的复杂性和开销。Black Marlin旨在消除这些依赖，同时保持最优性能

Method: 基于有向无环图(DAG)设计的新型拜占庭原子广播协议，在部分同步网络设置中运行，避免了传统协议中的可靠广播和公共硬币原语

Conclusion: Black Marlin协议成功证明了在无需可靠广播和公共硬币原语的情况下，仍能实现拜占庭原子广播的最优性能，为分布式系统协议设计提供了新的思路

Abstract: We introduce Black Marlin, the first Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based
Byzantine atomic broadcast protocol in a partially synchronous setting that
successfully forgoes the reliable broadcast and common coin primitives. Black
Marlin achieves the optimal latency of 3 rounds of communication (4.25 with
Byzantine faults) while maintaining optimal communication and amortized
communication complexities. We present a formal security analysis of the
protocol, accompanied by empirical evidence that Black Marlin outperforms
state-of-the-art DAG-based protocols in both throughput and latency.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了MOHAF框架，一种分布式多目标资源分配机制，在IoT环境中联合优化成本、服务质量、能效和公平性，相比传统方法显著提升了分配效率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT生态系统快速发展，传统集中式机制和单目标拍卖模型难以在动态分布式环境中实现平衡的系统性能，需要解决异构资源高效分配问题。

Method: 采用分层聚类降低计算复杂度，结合贪心次模优化策略保证(1-1/e)近似比，并引入动态定价机制实时适应资源利用率。

Result: 在Google集群数据上测试显示，MOHAF分配效率(0.263)显著优于Greedy(0.185)、First-Price(0.138)和Random(0.101)方法，同时实现完美公平性(Jain指数=1.000)。

Conclusion: MOHAF具有近线性可扩展性、理论保证和强大实证性能，为大规模IoT部署提供了实用且适应性强的解决方案，有效协调效率、公平性和可持续性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the
challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic,
distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and
single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost
minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system
performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction
Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly
optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness.
MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity
with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e)
approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to
resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality.
Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553
requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency
(0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101)
auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation
studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining
balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical
guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and
adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling
efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.

*Benedikt Pittl,Werner Mach,Erich Schikuta*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文分析了云虚拟机组合的成本优化策略，发现通过从不同市场空间购买异构虚拟机组合，并在运行时迁移虚拟机，可以显著降低成本。研究基于亚马逊定价数据和Bitbrains数据中心真实使用数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云提供商推出新型虚拟机交易方式（如Virtustream的muVMs），消费者需要从多个市场空间购买虚拟机组合（云组合）。行业需要最佳实践来指导如何创建最优组合以降低成本。

Method: 使用亚马逊的定价数据和Bitbrains数据中心的真实虚拟机使用数据集进行分析，验证时使用了来自不同应用领域的第二个Bitbrains数据集。

Result: 研究发现：1）只有创建异构组合（从不同市场空间购买虚拟机）才能达到成本最优；2）运行时迁移虚拟机具有成本效益，特别是对运行6小时到1年的虚拟机；3）大多数虚拟机资源从未被充分利用，存在巨大成本优化潜力。

Conclusion: 云虚拟机组合的成本优化需要通过跨市场空间的异构采购和运行时迁移策略来实现，未来在资源利用率方面还有显著的优化空间。

Abstract: In recent years, cloud providers have introduced novel approaches for trading
virtual machines. For example, Virtustream introduced so-called muVMs to charge
cloud computing resources while other providers such as Google, Microsoft, or
Amazon re-invented their marketspaces. Today, the market leader Amazon runs six
marketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of
virtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces
and providers. An industry-relevant field of research is to identify best
practices and guidelines on how such optimal portfolios are created. In the
paper at hand, a cost analysis of cloud portfolios is presented. Therefore,
pricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization
dataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can
only be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines
are purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of
migrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is
presented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines
of cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year. The paper further
shows that most of the resources of virtual machines are never utilized by
consumers, which represents a significant future potential for cost
optimization. For the validation of the results, a second dataset of the
Bitbrains datacenter was used, which contains utility data of virtual machines
from a different domain of application.

Abstract: Streaming videos from resource-constrained front-end devices over networks to
resource-rich cloud servers has long been a common practice for surveillance
and analytics. Most existing live video analytics (LVA) systems, however, have
been built over terrestrial networks, limiting their applications during
natural disasters and in remote areas that desperately call for real-time
visual data delivery and scene analysis. With the recent advent of space
networking, in particular, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations such
as Starlink, high-speed truly global Internet access is becoming available and
affordable. This paper examines the challenges and potentials of LVA over
modern LEO satellite networking (LSN). Using Starlink as the testbed, we have
carried out extensive in-the-wild measurements to gain insights into its
achievable performance for LVA. The results reveal that the uplink bottleneck
in today's LSN, together with the volatile network conditions, can
significantly affect the service quality of LVA and necessitate prompt
adaptation. We accordingly develop StarStream, a novel LSN-adaptive streaming
framework for LVA. At its core, StarStream is empowered by a Transformer-based
network performance predictor tailored for LSN and a content-aware
configuration optimizer. We discuss a series of key design and implementation
issues of StarStream and demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority through
trace-driven experiments with real-world network and video processing data.

Conclusion: OmniSense通过SRoI预测和自适应模型缩放，有效解决了360度视频分析的计算和网络资源挑战，实现了高精度低延迟的在线分析

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we
present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video
analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the
significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end
latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping
the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

Conclusion: LEAD为分布式键值系统中的高效数据检索提供了一个强大、可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are pivotal in numerous high-impact key-value
applications built on distributed networked systems, offering a decentralized
architecture that avoids single points of failure and improves data
availability. Despite their widespread utility, DHTs face substantial
challenges in handling range queries, which are crucial for applications such
as LLM serving, distributed storage, databases, content delivery networks, and
blockchains. To address this limitation, we present LEAD, a novel system
incorporating learned models within DHT structures to significantly optimize
range query performance. LEAD utilizes a recursive machine learning model to
map and retrieve data across a distributed system while preserving the inherent
order of data. LEAD includes the designs to minimize range query latency and
message cost while maintaining high scalability and resilience to network
churn. Our comprehensive evaluations, conducted in both testbed implementation
and simulations, demonstrate that LEAD achieves tremendous advantages in system
efficiency compared to existing range query methods in large-scale distributed
systems, reducing query latency and message cost by 80% to 90%+. Furthermore,
LEAD exhibits remarkable scalability and robustness against system churn,
providing a robust, scalable solution for efficient data retrieval in

Method: 开发数据驱动的预测流量工程算法，利用历史路由数据和对应链路速率数据直接生成路由配置更新

Result: 在真实网络拓扑和流量矩阵上的数值实验表明，DeeP-TE算法能够实现接近最优的控制效果，且路由变化显著低于基线方法

Conclusion: DeeP-TE算法通过数据驱动方法有效解决了自适应路由的挑战，在保持高性能的同时减少了路由波动

Abstract: Routing configurations of a network should constantly adapt to traffic
variations to achieve good network performance. Adaptive routing faces two main
challenges: 1) how to accurately measure/estimate time-varying traffic
matrices? 2) how to control the network and application performance degradation
caused by frequent route changes? In this paper, we develop a novel
data-enabled predictive traffic engineering (DeeP-TE) algorithm that minimizes
the network congestion by gracefully adapting routing configurations over time.
Our control algorithm can generate routing updates directly from the historical
routing data and the corresponding link rate data, without direct traffic
matrix measurement or estimation. Numerical experiments on real network
topologies with real traffic matrices demonstrate that the proposed DeeP-TE
routing adaptation algorithm can achieve close-to-optimal control effectiveness
with significantly lower routing variations than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Ensuring uninterrupted data flow in modern networks requires robust
fault-tolerant mechanisms, especially in environments where reliability and
responsiveness are critical. This paper presents the design and simulation of a
fault-tolerant network switching system using Python-based algorithms. A
simulated enterprise-level Local Area Network (LAN) was modeled using NetworkX
to represent switch-router interconnectivity with redundant links. Fault
scenarios, including link failure and congestion, were injected using Scapy,
while automatic failover and rerouting were implemented via custom Python
logic. The system demonstrates resilience by dynamically detecting path
failures, redistributing network traffic through redundant links, and
minimizing downtime. Performance evaluations reveal significant improvements in
packet delivery continuity, faster recovery times, and reduced packet loss
compared to non-fault-tolerant baselines. The implementation provides a
scalable and lightweight approach to integrating fault-tolerance features into
mid-scale networks, with potential application in enterprise information

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large-scale Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite
constellations has introduced unprecedented opportunities for global
connectivity. However, routing efficiency and inter-shell communication remain
key challenges in multi-shell architectures. This paper investigates the
structural properties and network dynamics of a representative six-shell
mega-constellation composed of 10,956 satellites and 198 gateway stations
(GSs). Leveraging tools from complex network analysis, we identify several
critical findings: (1) the constellation exhibits strong small-world
characteristics, enabling efficient routing despite large network diameters;
(2) GS relays play a pivotal role in enhancing inter-shell connectivity by
bridging otherwise disconnected components; (3) feeder links significantly
reduce average path length, making long-haul communication more feasible; (4)
betweenness analysis reveals load imbalances among GSs, indicating the need for
traffic-aware management strategies; (5) the architecture offers excellent
spatial coverage and resilience, maintaining connectivity and low routing costs
even under GS failures. These insights not only explain the design rationale
behind current mega-constellations like SpaceX Starlink, but also provide
valuable guidance for the evolution of future satellite network
infrastructures.

Motivation: 为了满足uRLLC应用严格的可靠性和延迟要求，需要在移动边缘计算环境中优化VNF放置，最大化网络服务提供商的收益。

Method: 采用近似随机舍入方法解决NP难优化问题，并提出贪心启发式方法处理资源约束违反问题。

Result: 随机舍入和贪心方法分别达到最优解的5%和10%以内，相比现有不考虑可用性要求的方法性能显著提升。原型实现显示冗余VNF放置改善了包传输率和延迟。

Conclusion: 研究强调了uRLLC应用中可用性和资源效率之间的权衡，提出的方法能有效满足严格的服务质量要求。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the virtual network function (VNF) placement problem
in mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled 5G networks to meet the stringent
reliability and latency requirements of uRLLC applications. We pose it as a
constrained optimization problem, which is NP-hard, to maximize the total
reward obtained by a network service provider by serving uRLLC service
requests. We propose an approximated randomized rounding approach to solve the
NP-hard optimization problem in polynomial time. We prove that the proposed
randomized approach achieves performance guarantees while violating the
resource constraints boundedly. Furthermore, we present a greedy-heuristic
approach to tackle the violations of resource constraints.
  Simulation results show that the proposed randomized rounding and greedy
approaches achieve a total reward which is within 5% and 10% of the optimal
solution, respectively. Furthermore, we compare the proposed greedy approach
with the existing schemes that do not consider the availability requirements.
We observe that the existing schemes perform poorly in terms of total reward,
as negligence to the availability requirements negatively impacts the number of
successfully served requests. These findings highlight the trade-off between
availability and resource efficiency in latency-sensitive uRLLC applications.
We also implement a software prototype of a 5G network using open-source
software platforms with redundant placement of VNFs. The results on packet
delivery ratio and latency obtained from the prototype implementation are also
improved in the redundant VNFs with different failure probabilities.

### [148] [Adaptive Network Selection for Latency-Aware V2X Systems under Varying Network and Vehicle Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14471)
*Muhammad Z. Haq,Nadia N. Qadri,Omer Chughtai,Sadiq A. Ahmad,Waqas Khalid,Heejung Yu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ANS-V2X是一个自适应网络选择框架，专为车辆密度变化和异构网络条件下的低延迟V2X系统设计，能够在15毫秒内完成决策，实现接近最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆环境需要低延迟高吞吐量通信，但实时网络选择面临多种应用需求和多种无线接入技术共存的挑战，现有方法要么计算时间过长，要么需要大量训练。

Method: 采用启发式驱动方法，考虑应用敏感性、延迟、计算负载和方向性约束，将车辆分配到不同网络，并与MILP最优解和Q学习方法进行对比。

Result: ANS-V2X实现接近最优性能（与MILP-V2X相差5-10%），执行时间减少85%以上，决策时间低于15毫秒，在动态场景中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架适合在延迟关键的V2X系统中进行实时边缘级部署，在保证性能的同时大幅提升决策效率。

Abstract: This paper presents ANS-V2X, an Adaptive Network Selection framework tailored
for latency-aware V2X systems operating under varying vehicle densities and
heterogeneous network conditions. Modern vehicular environments demand
low-latency and high-throughput communication, yet real-time network selection
is hindered by diverse application requirements and the coexistence of multiple
Radio Access Technologies (RATs) such as 4G, 5G, and ad hoc links. ANS-V2X
employs a heuristic-driven approach to assign vehicles to networks by
considering application sensitivity, latency, computational load, and
directionality constraints. The framework is benchmarked against a
Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for optimal solutions and a
Q-learning-based method representing reinforcement learning. Simulation results
demonstrate that ANS-V2X achieves near-optimal performance, typically within 5
to 10% of the utility achieved by MILP-V2X, while reducing execution time by
more than 85%. Although MILP-V2X offers globally optimal results, its
computation time often exceeds 100 milliseconds, making it unsuitable for
real-time applications. The Q-learning-based method is more adaptable but
requires extensive training and converges slowly in dynamic scenarios. In
contrast, ANS-V2X completes decisions in under 15 milliseconds and consistently
delivers lower latency than both alternatives. This confirms its suitability
for real-time, edge-level deployment in latency-critical V2X systems

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多层级无人机辅助边缘计算系统，通过调整任务优先级、资源分配和路径规划，在保证能量稳定性的同时最小化任务执行延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低空网络中轻量级无人机(L-UAVs)在耐久性和计算资源方面的限制，通过高级无人机(H-UAV)作为移动备份服务器来提升系统性能。

Method: 使用Lyapunov优化技术将问题解耦成一系列确定性问题，根据实时能量状态自适应调整任务延迟和能耗的优先级，包括任务分配、计算资源分配和无人机轨迹规划。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该方法能够为L-UAVs节省26%以上的传输能耗，并且在能量稳定性方面显示出更优异的性能。

Conclusion: 该多层级无人机辅助边缘计算系统通过动态优先级调整和资源管理，有效地解决了轻量级无人机的耐久性和计算资源限制问题，实现了任务执行效率和能量稳定性的平衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-tier UAV-assisted edge computing system
designed for low-altitude networks. The system comprises vehicle users,
lightweight Low-Tier UAVs (L-UAVs), and High-Tier UAV (H-UAV). L-UAVs function
as small-scale edge servers positioned closer to vehicle users, while the
H-UAV, equipped with more powerful server and larger-capacity battery, serves
as mobile backup server to address the limitations in endurance and computing
resources of L-UAVs. The primary objective is to minimize task execution delays
while ensuring long-term energy stability for L-UAVs. To address this
challenge, the problem is first decoupled into a series of deterministic
problems for each time slot using Lyapunov optimization. The priorities of task
delay and energy consumption for L-UAVs are adaptively adjusted based on
real-time energy status. The optimization tasks include assignment of tasks,
allocation of computing resources, and trajectory planning for both L-UAVs and
H-UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a
reduction of at least 26% in transmission energy for L-UAVs and exhibits
superior energy stability compared to existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉和深度强化学习的移动传感器自主部署策略，通过多智能体协作实现覆盖最大化，相比传统方法显著提升覆盖率和能效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无线传感器网络依赖预设部署导致覆盖重叠和能效低下，移动传感器网络可通过自主部署解决传感器失效和静态覆盖限制问题

Method: 结合实时摄像头系统和深度强化学习，通过检测传感器LED指示灯评估覆盖情况，采用多智能体强化学习框架实现分散式协作控制

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了移动无线传感器网络的适应性、能效和鲁棒性，为物联网提供了实用的部署解决方案

Abstract: Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of
the target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial
deployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued
network operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile
Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static
coverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This
paper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously
position themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for
predefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and
evaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor
movement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network
through a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling
decentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a
vision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL
framework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that
adjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to
traditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5%
improvement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22%
decrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach
significantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in
MWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.

Motivation: 无线传感器网络中高效能量管理对延长网络寿命和确保可靠数据传输至关重要，需要动态适应能量分布的自适应路由方案

Method: 使用强化学习（Q-learning）和多智能体系统，每个传感器节点作为自主智能体，基于剩余能量、距离等状态参数选择路由动作，结合MER和MST图算法优化能量消耗和负载均衡

Conclusion: 该方法为能量受限的WSN提供了可扩展和自适应的解决方案，通过强化学习与经典算法的融合实现了优异的能量管理和负载平衡性能

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
to extend network lifetime and ensure reliable data transmission. This paper
presents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head
selection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning
within a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on
the energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an
autonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy,
distance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions
that maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths,
each sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes
to a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of
Charge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient
learning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load
distribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining
signal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or
via a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale
deployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical
graph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing.
Simulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node
survival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it
a scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor
deployments and IoT applications.

*Ryan Tjoa,Poorva Garg,Harrison Goldstein,Todd Millstein,Benjamin Pierce,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了自动调整属性测试生成器权重的方法，通过符号权重和优化目标函数来改进测试输入的分布和多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统属性测试中，用户需要手动调整生成器的权重来获得理想的测试输入分布，这个过程既繁琐又难以达到预期效果，限制了测试的效率和覆盖率

Method: 开发了Loaded Dice离散概率编程系统，支持符号权重和参数学习，通过给定的目标函数自动优化生成器权重，以改善测试用例的分布、多样性和有效性

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效优化生成器分布，在针对多样性和有效性自动调优后，生成器在bug发现方面实现了3.1-7.4倍的加速

Conclusion: 自动化的生成器权重调优技术能够显著提升属性测试的效率，通过优化测试输入分布来更快地发现软件缺陷

Abstract: Property-based testing validates software against an executable specification
by evaluating it on randomly generated inputs. The standard way that PBT users
generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs
through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users
must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual
random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose
individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so
today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be
practically achieved.
  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of
generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an
objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights
that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that
allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity
and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel
discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports
differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for
generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at
optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective
functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks,
demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the
generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.

### [153] [Close is Good Enough: Component-Based Synthesis Modulo Logical Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14614)
*Ashish Mishra,Suresh Jagannathan*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于组件合成的新方法，通过引入精化类型规范和合格树自动机来推理执行路径间的逻辑相似性，从而避免探索语义相似的路径，显著提升了复杂查询的合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于组件合成(CBS)方法在处理具有精确约束的查询时，由于可行解空间稀疏，搜索效率低下。当库方法配备更丰富的规范时，搜索需要处理仅在少数执行路径上成立的约束，这给搜索带来了巨大挑战。

Method: 为库方法配备精化类型规范，在基础类型上添加丰富的逻辑限定符来约束类型接受的值集。使用合格树自动机(QTA)变体进行搜索，智能记录枚举项信息，利用精化类型的子类型约束来推理候选解之间的相似性。

Result: 实现了名为\name的工具，综合评估表明该工具能够合成复杂CBS查询的解决方案，其能力远超现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: 通过引入逻辑相似性推理机制，该方法显著提升了基于组件合成的效率和能力，能够处理传统方法无法解决的复杂合成问题。

Abstract: Component-based synthesis (CBS) aims to generate loop-free programs from a
set of libraries whose methods are annotated with specifications and whose
output must satisfy a set of logical constraints, expressed as a query. The
effectiveness of a CBS algorithm critically depends on the severity of the
constraints imposed by the query. The more exact these constraints are, the
sparser the space of feasible solutions. This maxim also applies when we enrich
the expressiveness of the specifications affixed to library methods. In both
cases, the search must now contend with constraints that may only hold over a
small number of the possible execution paths that can be enumerated by a CBS
procedure.
  In this paper, we address this challenge by equipping CBS search with the
ability to reason about logical similarities among the paths it explores. Our
setting considers library methods equipped with refinement-type specifications
that enrich ordinary base types with a set of rich logical qualifiers to
constrain the set of values accepted by that type. We perform a search over a
tree automata variant called Qualified Tree Automata that intelligently records
information about enumerated terms, leveraging subtyping constraints over the
refinement types associated with these terms to enable reasoning about
similarity among candidate solutions as search proceeds, thereby avoiding
exploration of semantically similar paths.
  We present an implementation of this idea in a tool called \name, and provide
a comprehensive evaluation that demonstrates \name's ability to synthesize
solutions to complex CBS queries that go well-beyond the capabilities of the
existing state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: RealDevWorld是一个新颖的评估框架，用于自动端到端评估LLMs生成生产就绪软件的能力，通过GUI交互模拟和细粒度诊断反馈，解决了现有基准测试无法捕捉运行时动态行为的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖静态检查或二进制通过/失败脚本，无法评估具有图形界面、交互逻辑和动态行为的完整软件应用程序的真实可用性，存在评估盲点。

Method: 提出RealDevWorld框架，包含两个核心组件：RealDevBench（194个多领域开放式软件工程任务集合）和AppEvalPilot（基于代理的GUI交互评估系统），通过模拟真实用户交互来自动评估软件功能正确性、视觉保真度和运行时行为。

Result: 实证结果显示，RealDevWorld实现了0.92的准确率和0.85的人类专家评估相关性，显著减少了对人工评审的依赖，支持可扩展的、与人类对齐的生产级软件评估。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLMs生成生产就绪软件提供了有效、自动且与人类评估对齐的评估方法，填补了当前评估方法的空白，支持细粒度的任务特定诊断反馈。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 代码编写任务规范通常用自然语言表达且可能存在歧义，程序员需要具备识别和解决这些歧义的能力

Method: 基于ARHF（Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback）技术：(1)识别可能产生歧义的特定输入；(2)寻求有限的人类反馈；(3)利用反馈生成解决歧义的代码

Result: 开发并评估了原型系统的有效性

Conclusion: 讨论了此类辅助系统对计算机科学教育的影响

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural
language and may be ambiguous. Programmers must therefore develop the ability
to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

*Yewei Song,Tiezhu Sun,Xunzhu Tang,Prateek Rajput,Tegawende F. Bissyande,Jacques Klein*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于抽象语法树（AST）的结构熵方法，用于评估大型语言模型代码生成的稳定性，无需参考代码或执行测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM代码生成的稳定性对于判断其在真实开发环境中的可靠性至关重要，现有指标如pass@k、BLEU等存在参考依赖和执行依赖的局限性。

Method: 将结构熵概念扩展到程序领域，通过分析AST的深度受限子树的多重集，计算相对频率作为概率分布，使用Jensen-Shannon散度和结构交叉熵比率两种互补指标来度量稳定性。

Result: 在标准代码生成任务上对多个领先LLM进行基准测试，证明AST驱动的结构熵能够揭示模型一致性和鲁棒性的细微差别。

Conclusion: 该方法在O(n,d)时间内运行且无需外部测试，为代码生成评估工具包提供了一个轻量级的补充方案，具有参考无关、语言无关和执行无关的优势。

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成基准测试主要关注功能正确性，忽视了代码质量的其他重要维度，如安全性、可靠性、可读性和可维护性。需要系统评估LLM在多维度代码质量方面的能力。

Method: 使用PythonSecurityEval基准测试，引入基于Bandit和Pylint的迭代静态分析驱动提示算法，通过多次迭代识别和解决代码质量问题。

Result: GPT-4o在十次迭代后取得显著改进：安全问题从>40%降至13%，可读性违规从>80%降至11%，可靠性警告从>50%降至11%。

Conclusion: 静态分析反馈指导下的LLM能够显著提升代码质量，超越单纯的功能正确性，为高质量代码生成提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, achieving high scores on benchmarks such as HumanEval and
MBPP. However, these benchmarks primarily assess functional correctness and
neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability,
readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using
the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static
analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to
identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show
substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability
violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within
ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static
analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional
correctness.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of low-cost environmental sensors and AI-enabled
applications has accelerated the demand for scalable and resilient data
infrastructures, particularly in data-scarce and resource-constrained regions.
This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the AirQo
data pipeline: a modular, cloud-native Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) system
engineered to support both real-time and batch processing of heterogeneous air
quality data across urban deployments in Africa. It is Built using open-source
technologies such as Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, and Google BigQuery. The
pipeline integrates diverse data streams from low-cost sensors, third-party
weather APIs, and reference-grade monitors to enable automated calibration,
forecasting, and accessible analytics. We demonstrate the pipeline's ability to
ingest, transform, and distribute millions of air quality measurements monthly
from over 400 monitoring devices while achieving low latency, high throughput,
and robust data availability, even under constrained power and connectivity
conditions. The paper details key architectural features, including workflow
orchestration, decoupled ingestion layers, machine learning-driven sensor
calibration, and observability frameworks. Performance is evaluated across
operational metrics such as resource utilization, ingestion throughput,
calibration accuracy, and data availability, offering practical insights into
building sustainable environmental data platforms. By open-sourcing the
platform and documenting deployment experiences, this work contributes a
reusable blueprint for similar initiatives seeking to advance environmental
intelligence through data engineering in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的软件结构模式，通过概念和同步机制来提升代码可读性和模块化，以解决LLM编程时代软件难以理解和维护的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM编程器的出现要求重新评估软件结构。当前软件往往缺乏代码与行为的直接对应关系（不可读性），模块化不足，无法满足增量开发、完整性和透明性这三个健壮编程的关键需求。

Method: 提出基于概念和同步的结构模式：概念是完全独立的服务，同步是基于事件的规则来协调概念间交互。使用领域特定语言来表达同步行为，使功能特征能够以细粒度和声明式方式表达。

Result: 通过RealWorld基准测试的案例研究来验证该方法，展示了新结构模式在提升软件可读性和模块化方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 新的概念-同步结构模式能够显著改善软件的可读性和模块化程度，特别适合LLM生成代码的场景，为现代软件开发提供了更健壮的架构方案。

Abstract: The opportunities offered by LLM coders (and their current limitations)
demand a reevaluation of how software is structured. Software today is often
"illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed
behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key
requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small
increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior
increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and
what actions have happened at runtime).
  A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its
elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and
event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for
synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and
declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the
RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.

Conclusion: Preguss通过静态分析与演绎验证的协同，为解决大规模软件硬件系统自动化验证这一终极目标提供了有前景的方法

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is
arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have
recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in
formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to
deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length
limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex,
interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular,
fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal
specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive
verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error
(RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii)
LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We
envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated
verification of large-scale programs.

especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用大语言模型自动生成问答系统组件行为解释的方法，通过分析SPARQL查询输入和RDF三元组输出来提供可理解的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质问答框系统的组件通常使用AI方法，其行为和决策难以解释，给专家和用户带来理解困难。

Method: 利用组件的输入(SPARQL查询)和输出(RDF三元组)数据流作为解释来源，采用模板基础方法(基准线)和大语言模型(自动生成)来生成解释。

Result: 评估显示，通过LLMs生成的解释质量高，大多数情况下超过模板基础方法，获得用户更高评分。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动向人类解释QA组件的行为和决策，以RDF和SPARQL为上下文生成高质量的解释。

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

TL;DR: MERLAN是一个用于规范多模态界面需求的领域特定语言(DSL)，包含元模型、文本语法和原型工具，能够自动生成基于智能体框架的合规系统实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习技术的进步，多模态系统日益普及，但缺乏适合多模态交互特性的需求规范语言和方法，导致AI增强系统可能无法满足用户需求。

Method: 提出MERLAN DSL，包括定义元模型、实现ANTLR语法文本语法，并开发原型工具让需求工程师编写需求并自动生成基于智能体框架的系统实现。

Result: 开发了一个完整的需求规范语言和工具链，能够有效支持多模态界面需求的描述和系统实现。

Conclusion: MERLAN为解决多模态系统需求规范挑战提供了有效的语言和方法支持，有助于确保AI增强系统更好地满足用户需求。

Abstract: Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio,
and images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in software systems, enabled by
the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily
define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions,
potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an
open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse
nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced
systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs.
  In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We
present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax
implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements
engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible
implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework
is also provided.

TL;DR: 对5个主流大语言模型生成的Java代码进行静态分析，发现虽然功能正常但存在大量软件缺陷，包括安全漏洞和代码异味，功能测试通过率不能反映代码质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLM生成代码的功能性能，但缺乏对代码质量和安全性的定量分析，需要系统评估LLM生成代码的生产就绪程度

Method: 使用SonarQube对4,442个Java编程作业生成的代码进行静态分析，评估5个主流LLM（Claude Sonnet 4、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2 90B、OpenCoder 8B）的代码质量

Result: 所有模型生成的代码都存在软件缺陷，包括严重安全问题（如硬编码密码、路径遍历漏洞），功能测试通过率与代码质量无直接相关性

Conclusion: LLM生成的代码需要静态分析验证才能用于生产环境，功能基准测试分数不能代表代码质量和安全性，静态分析是检测潜在缺陷的重要工具

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

### [165] [The Hidden Cost of Readability: How Code Formatting Silently Consumes Your LLM Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13666)
*Dangfeng Pan,Zhensu Sun,Cenyuan Zhang,David Lo,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现代码格式化元素（如缩进和换行）对大型语言模型的性能影响有限，移除这些元素可减少24.5%的输入token，显著提升LLM效率而不影响代码生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码格式化元素虽然提高了人类可读性，但对LLM处理可能不必要，反而增加计算成本和响应时间，需要验证这些元素对LLM的实际价值。

Method: 通过在四种编程语言（Java、Python、C++、C#）和十个LLM上进行大规模Fill-in-the-Middle代码补全实验，系统分析格式化元素移除前后的token数量和性能变化。

Result: LLM在格式化代码和非格式化代码上性能相当，平均输入token减少24.5%，输出token减少可忽略不计；通过提示和微调可进一步减少36.1%的输出代码长度。

Conclusion: 代码格式化移除是实用的LLM效率优化策略，开发的双向代码转换工具可无缝集成到现有推理工作流中，兼顾人类可读性和LLM效率。

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆验证与验证是一个复杂但关键的过程，特别是通过模拟确保安全性和覆盖范围。然而实现真实有用的模拟面临重大挑战，需要系统性地识别这些挑战和解决方案

Method: 举办专家研讨会进行头脑风暴识别关键障碍，然后分发调查问卷以整合发现并获得对潜在解决方案的进一步见解

Result: 专家们识别出17个关键挑战及相应解决方案，评估了这些是否代表研究的下一个步骤以及实施障碍。资源不足在解决方案讨论中成为关键需求

Conclusion: 许多已识别的问题已有已知解决方案，可以将重点转向未解决的挑战，并与更广泛的社区分享下一步行动

Abstract: Verification and validation of vehicles is a complex yet critical process,
particularly for ensuring safety and coverage through simulations. However,
achieving realistic and useful simulations comes with significant challenges.
To explore these challenges, we conducted a workshop with experts in the field,
allowing them to brainstorm key obstacles. Following this, we distributed a
survey to consolidate findings and gain further insights into potential
solutions. The experts identified 17 key challenges, along with proposed
solutions, an assessment of whether they represent next steps for research, and
the roadblocks to their implementation. While a lack of resources was not
initially highlighted as a major challenge, utilizing more resources emerged as
a critical necessity when experts discussed solutions. Interestingly, we
expected some of these challenges to have already been addressed or to have
systematic solutions readily available, given the collective expertise in the
field. Many of the identified problems already have known solutions, allowing
us to shift focus towards unresolved challenges and share the next steps with
the broader community.

TL;DR: 本文使用范畴论重新表述货币宏观经济会计理论(MoMaT)，将微观会计一致性提升到宏观层面，通过范畴论的极限和余极限构造验证宏观经济约束和聚合信息。

Motivation: 建立宏观经济会计系统的范畴理论框架，将微观双记账系统组合为宏观会计系统，解决生产者的投入产出支付不同步问题，为社会经济风险分担和GDP共享提供一致性基础。

Method: 采用范畴论作为组合语法和模块系统，通过内函子实现层次化贷款偿还合同的一致性演化，使用极限验证宏观经济层面的约束条件，余极限计算聚合信息。

Result: 理论通过五个部门代理(劳动资源所有者、公司、资本家、银行)的八个宏观经济记账展示稳定收敛，数值模拟验证了MoMaT的稳定性。

Conclusion: 范畴论为货币会计系统提供了严格的数学基础，能够实现经济概念到范畴概念的映射，支持数字孪生系统的跨学科合作。

Abstract: We present a category theoretical formulation of the Monetary Macroeconomic
Accounting Theory (MoMaT) of Men\'endez and Winschel [2025]. We take
macroeconomic (national) accounting systems to be composed from microeconomic
double-entry systems with real and monetary units of accounts. Category theory
is the compositional grammar and module system of mathematics which we use to
lift micro accounting consistency to the macro level. The main function of
money in MoMaT is for the repayment of loans and not for the exchange of goods,
bridging the desynchronisation of input and output payments of producers.
Accordingly, temporal accounting consistency is at the macroeconomic level. We
show that the accounting for macroeconomies organised by a division of labor
can be consistent and stable as a prerequisite for risk and GDP sharing of
societies. We exemplify the theory by five sectoral agents of Labor and
Resource owners, a Company as the productive sector, a Capitalist for profits,
and a Bank as the financial sector providing loans to synchronise the micro and
the macro levels of an economy. The dynamics is described by eight sectoral
macroeconomic bookings in each period demonstrating stable convergence of the
MoMaT in numerical simulations. The categorical program implements a consistent
evolution of hierarchical loan repayment contracts by an endofunctor. The
universal constructions of a limit verify all constraints as the sectoral
investment and learning function at the macroeconomic level. The dual colimit
computes the aggregated informations at the macro level as usual in the
mathematics of transitions from local to global structures. We use visual
diagrams to make complex economic relationships intuitive. This paper is meant
to map economic to categorical concepts to enable interdisciplinary
collaboration for digital twins of monetary accounting systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文建立了一个一般均衡模型，探讨企业在部门间的利润寻求重新分配动态。模型展现了集中优化特性和长期效率，并通过欧盟企业数据进行了实证检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究异质性因素分配下企业在部门间的动态重新分配机制，以及这种分散化决策如何形成整体经济动态和长期效率。

Method: 构建一般均衡模型，使用Wasserstein空间中的梯度流推导聚合动态，并扩展模型包括非对称偏好、部门内外部性、重分配固定成本等。使用2018-2023年欧盟企业数据进行实证分析。

Result: 发现分散化决策可重解为全局优化问题，长期竞争均衡具有效率。实证结果显示部门利润率收敛但劳动生产率差异持续，指向劳动不可移动性，同时未发现显著重分配固定成本。

Conclusion: 分散化的利润寻求行为能够形成效率化的全局动态，甚至在存在外部性时也可能保持效率。劳动市场的不完全调整是影响经济效率的关键因素。

Abstract: We develop a general equilibrium model in which, at each instant, a short-run
competitive equilibrium arises. Heterogeneity in factor allocation generates
differential profit rates across sectors, prompting firms to move between them
under myopic profit-seeking behaviour, subject to quadratic reallocation costs.
The aggregate dynamics of the economy can be formalised as a gradient flow in a
Wasserstein space, starting from a partial differential equation that describes
the reallocation of firms across sectors. Two key emergent properties arise:
(i) decentralised and uncoordinated decisions can be reinterpreted as the
solution to a sequence of global optimisation problems, involving a function of
aggregate consumption, which increases monotonically along the dynamic path;
(ii) the long-run competitive equilibrium is efficient, as the distribution of
firms maximises aggregate consumption and profit rates are equalised across
sectors. We extend the baseline model to incorporate non-symmetric preferences,
intrasectoral externalities, a fixed cost of reallocation, and labour
immobility. These extensions reveal conditions under which the efficiency and
uniqueness of the long-run equilibrium may fail, but also highlight the
surprising result that the decentralised equilibrium can remain efficient even
in the presence of externalities. Finally, using a large sample of EU firms
from the period 2018-2023, we empirically document convergence in sectoral
profit rates, but not in labour productivity, pointing to a certain degree of
labour immobility. We also find evidence suggesting the absence of significant
fixed costs of reallocation at the sectoral level, the presence of positive but
limited intrasectoral externalities, and a moderate degree of substitutability
among goods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在多单元概率分配中同时实现公平性（特别是平等对待平等个体）和各种效率概念，解决现有方法在公平与效率权衡中的局限性。

Method: 扩展ETE定义，分析ETE重分配程序与ex-post效率、序数效率、秩最小化效率的关系，提出结合序列独裁规则和ETE重分配的构造方法。

Result: 证明ETE重分配保持ex-post效率但不一定保持序数效率，但ETE重分配秩最小化分配可保持秩最小化效率，从而证明同时满足ETE和序数效率的分配存在性。

Conclusion: 提出了在一般上界约束下构造同时满足ETE和序数效率分配的计算高效方法，为公平与效率的平衡提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies general multi-unit probabilistic assignment problems
involving indivisible objects, with a particular focus on achieving the
fundamental fairness notion known as equal treatment of equals (ETE) and
ensuring various notions of efficiency. We extend the definition of ETE so that
it accommodates a variety of constraints and applications. We analyze the ETE
reassignment procedure, which transforms any assignment into one satisfying
ETE, and examine its compatibility with three efficiency concepts: ex-post
efficiency, ordinal efficiency, and rank-minimizing efficiency. We show that
while the ETE reassignment of an ex-post efficient assignment remains ex-post
efficient, it may fail to preserve ordinal efficiency in general settings.
However, since the ETE reassignment of a rank-minimizing assignment preserves
rank-minimizing efficiency, the existence of assignments satisfying both ETE
and ordinal efficiency can be established. Furthermore, we propose a
computationally efficient method for constructing assignments that satisfy both
ETE and ordinal efficiency under general upper bound constraints, by combining
the serial dictatorship rule with appropriately specified priority lists and an
ETE reassignment.

Motivation: 经济学家将算法能够学习制定合谋价格解释为默契合谋，但论文认为这种观点忽视了算法设计者在参数化过程中的主动作用

Method: 建立了一个算法设计者之间的元游戏模型，分析算法参数化层面的战略交互

Result: 在元游戏层面发现了新的均衡现象和合谋现象，证明算法的共同参数化是得到算法合谋的必要条件

Conclusion: 算法合谋应被重新观为算法设计者之间的明显合谋，而非算法自身的默契合谋，这为相关法律规制提供了新的视角

Abstract: This paper proposes a fresh `meta-game' perspective on the problem of
algorithmic collusion in pricing games a la Bertrand. Economists have
interpreted the fact that algorithms can learn to price collusively as tacit
collusion. We argue instead that the co-parametrization of algorithms -- that
we show is necessary to obtain algorithmic collusion -- requires algorithm
designer(s) to engage in explicit collusion by algorithm orchestration. To
highlight this, we model a meta-game of algorithm parametrization that is
played by algorithm designers, and the relevant strategic analyses at that
level reveal new equilibrium and collusion phenomena.

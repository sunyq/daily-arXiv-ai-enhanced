Such changes may occur due to expected shifts in the data\ndistribution, i.e., concept drift, or unexpected anomalous changes. The\npresence of concept drift poses challenges for anomaly detection in time\nseries. While anomalies are caused by undesirable changes in the data,\ndifferentiating abnormal changes from varying normal behaviours is difficult\ndue to differing frequencies of occurrence, varying time intervals when normal\npatterns occur. Differentiating between concept drift and anomalies is critical\nfor accurate analysis as studies have shown that the compounding effects of\nerror propagation in downstream data analysis tasks lead to lower detection\naccuracy and increased overhead due to unnecessary model updates.\nUnfortunately, existing work has largely explored anomaly detection and concept\ndrift detection in isolation. We develop AnDri, a system for Anomaly detection\nin the presence of Drift, which adjusts the normal patterns temporally, and\ndistinguish abnormal subsequences and new concepts.

To\ndetermine more efficient plans, we propose Delta, a mixed cost-based query\noptimization framework that consists of a compatible query detector and a\ntwo-stage planner.

For compatible queries, Delta activates its two-stage mixed cost-based\nplanner. Stage I serves as a coarse-grained filter to generate high-quality\ncandidate plans based on the value network via beam search, relaxing precision\nrequirements and narrowing the search space. Stage II employs a fine-grained\nranker to determine the best plan from the candidate plans based on a learned\ncost model.

We analyze and\ncategorize 122 representative studies into regression test case prioritization,\nminimization, and selection methods. A structured taxonomy is introduced to\nclearly illustrate their applicability and limitations within ROSAS contexts.\nFurthermore, we highlight major challenges specific to regression testing for\nROSAS, including effectively prioritizing tests in response to frequent system\nmodifications, efficiently minimizing redundant tests, and difficulty in\naccurately selecting impacted test cases. Finally, we propose research insights\nand identify promising future directions, such as leveraging frame-to-vector\ncoverage metrics, multi-source foundation models, and neurosymbolic reasoning\nto enhance regression testing efficiency and effectiveness. This survey\nprovides a foundational reference and practical roadmap for advancing the\nstate-of-the-art in regression testing optimization for ROSAS."}

To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal\nreasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding\nand capturing visual information.

Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

The sign distance function\nrepresents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any\npoint in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in\nterms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate\nproblems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving\ndomain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map\nobstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a\nlearning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data\nand a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)\nmaps.

This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted\nAuthority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises\nbelief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured\nscientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and\nevaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and\ntemporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian\ninference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The\narchitecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility\nmodelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By\nformalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic\nnetwork, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that\npromote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient\nintegrity across dynamic scientific domains."}

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our\nfindings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future\ninvestigations into designing variable system prompts."}

In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage.

Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers)\nmay efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical\nlimitations.

Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal\nreasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings\nis less studied.

Current Mamba-based computer-vision\nmethods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward\nscan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a\nfull receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,\neroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To\neliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM\nblock that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward\nselective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform.

Recent studies mainly follow the\ntransformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,\nevent localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on\nthe general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn\nthe event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of\ntraining data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we\npropose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects\nthe explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to\nimprove the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the\none hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the\nscene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as\nposition prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate\nthe implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event\nrelation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event\nboundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the\nsemantic coherence of the captions.

Specifically, we\ndesign Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the\npre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that\nare helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context\nAdaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation\nwithout modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using\nthese adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.\nAdditionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose\nDiscrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in\nthe object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge\ndistillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable\nparameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three\nout-of-distribution fine-grained datasets."}

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents."}

It has recently attracted surging\nacademic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although\nthere are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still\nhave limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different\nlevels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little\ndiscussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the\ngap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely\nGeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and\nprovide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be\nable to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate\nwith vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability\nto reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In\nthis work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially\ncurated dataset GeoExplain which consists of\npanoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a\nmultimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make\nprediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual\ninformation and external knowledge.

However,\nquantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the\npresence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.\nWhile bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may\nalso reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we\nconduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that\nmitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in\nGPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information\nwhen model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect\nmeasured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free\nconfidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases\ninduce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is\nlower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater\nunderestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,\nwhereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric\nuncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias\nmitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the\ndevelopment of more advanced techniques."}

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains\ndiagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'\nidentities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including\nquantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that\nSafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant\nfacial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning\nsucceeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned\nabstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface\nform.

Recent developments\nincorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,\nexisting approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,\nneglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)\nmodel, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the\nHSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of\nmode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction\n(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the\nthree directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation\nmodule to produce the final result.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording.

Although\nthere are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still\nhave limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different\nlevels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little\ndiscussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the\ngap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely\nGeoGuess.

The network takes as input surround-view camera images,\ngoal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It\noutputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and\ngear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with\ntarget points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling\ndynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both\nvertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a\nhigh success rate of 96.57\\%, with average positional and orientation errors of\n0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and\ngoal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:\nhttps://github.com/little-snail-f/ParkFormer."}

Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

However,\nexisting static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess\nrisks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic\nrisks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc\nevaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,\nwe propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive\nemergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We\nthus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive\nsafety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks\ninstantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel\nprocess-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are\nperformed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on\nleading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current\nagents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware\nChain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.\nBy highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for\ndeveloping safer and more reliable embodied AI systems."}

Existing\nblack-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or\nimage perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard\ncontent filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.\nIn this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),\na novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts\ninto semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'\ncross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful\ninstructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection\nmechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires\nsignificantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and\nefficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate\nCAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model\ntransferability.

An open question is how to represent such a relation in\na compact form and maintain this property during query evaluation. We\ninvestigate four compact representations of answers to a such queries, which\nare based on alternative ways to encode sets of intervals.

To embrace flexibility, knowledge\ngraphs often lack enforced schemas (i.e., ontologies), leading to potential\ndata quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Therefore,\nensuring their quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect\napplications relying on them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs,\nexisting works either propose high-level frameworks comprising various data\nquality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure\ndata quality with ad-hoc SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)\nqueries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes\nConstraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph.\nAlthough the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none\nof them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions.

Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and\nreusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an\nensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and\nreusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only\nperforms direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,\n2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often\ntrivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from\nself-consistency or self-correction.

The model identifies the conditions under which publisher\ninterventions such as blocking AI agents or imposing tolls may mitigate these\neffects, although they risk fragmenting access and value. I formalize the\nresulting inefficiency as an \"attention lemons\" problem, where synthetic agent\ntraffic dilutes the quality of attention sold to advertisers, generating\nadverse selection. To address this, I propose a Pigouvian correction mechanism:\na per-delegation fee designed to internalize the externality and restore\nwelfare.

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models.

However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have\nrarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained\nquantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for\nmultiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in\nImage Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,\nContent, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains\n40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we\ndevelop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various\ndimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I\nand I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to\ngenerate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among\nmodel-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for\neach type of generative model.

Reasoning! Efficient Directed Fuzzing via Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of\nrandomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of\nfuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed\nfuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,\nthe dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical\ncomponents, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely\ntied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the\nchallenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to\nremove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With\ntheir strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to\ngenerate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct\nbug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which\nintegrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and\nmutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call\nchain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To\nconstruct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,\nobtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which\nfurther help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate\nRandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,\nBeacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers\nachieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\\times$ to 4.8$\\times$ compared to\nusing widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual\nbugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\\times$ speedup compared to the\nsecond-fastest exposure.

CoEx plans\nand interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic\nplans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously\nincorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the\nform of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and\ncode-based symbolic memory.

However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses\nsignificant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data\naccess requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose\na profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are\ncollaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership.

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets.

Traditional diagnostic workflows,\nhowever, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and\nresource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and\ninterpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature\nextraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration\nof handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our\nmodel to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features\nfrom retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark\ndatasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for\nGlaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates\nconsistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for\nbinary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the\nIC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\\% accuracy, 94.8\\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art models.

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To\nbe specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease\ndimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for\neffective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve\ngeneralization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to\napply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in\nextracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.\nFurthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features\nfurther improves the accuracy.

A common rendering setup\nfor training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and\nrenders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable\nviews, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios\ninvolving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free\nfeed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors\nlearned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained\nmodel augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers.

However, existing methods\ntypically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their\nability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we\nintroduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that\ncombines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to\nenable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal\nremote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a\nlarge-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid\nrule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change\ncaptioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question\nanswering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose\nDeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM\nfeatures three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to\ncapture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a\ncross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and\n(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant\ndifference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual\ninstructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large\nlanguage model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize\nefficiency.

However, existing tools tend to generate\npatches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are\nknown as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch\nCorrectness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches\ngenerated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no\nadditional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.\nCurrent static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and\ntransparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA\ntechnique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking\ntasks.

To enhance these reasoning capabilities\nfor the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement\nLearning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated\non a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score.

Designed to learn and act independently,\nthese systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.\nHowever, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which\nare unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the\ndecision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous\nsystems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When\nmultiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must\nnegotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the\nparties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous\nsystems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into\ntheir decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a\ndomain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable\nof ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an\nimplementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which\ncan be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation\ncapabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real\nrobots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource\ncontention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness\nof the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation.

To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically.

Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables\nthe model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of\ndefects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with\nthree different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to\nco-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely\nadopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,\ncompared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\\% to\n48.29\\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\\% to 53.28\\%, and test coverage\nby 0.78\\% to 53.96\\%.

Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies.

Existing\nmethods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive\nfusion of cross-modal features.

Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive\nCue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain\nDynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack\ncues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning\nStrategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain\nPerceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture\nspatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities.

Existing\nenhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation\nconditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors\neffectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional\ndiffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a\ndegraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level\nusing a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous\ndegradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a\nnovel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet\nbackbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature\nrefinement.

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked.

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene.

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound\nimages for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,\nposing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of\ntrained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a\nvision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal\nultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image\nquality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce\nFetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN\nand Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of\n0.757.

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference.

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality.

Furthermore,\nwe introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the\nchallenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of\naudiovisual content in OmniAVS.

However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a\ncomplementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u6559\u5b66\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7ebf\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d7\u7ef4\u679c\u8328\u57fa\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u2018AI Social Gym\u2019\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005AI\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08AI\u8fdb\u884c\u6559\u5b66\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u95ee\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5411\u6559\u5b66\u6216\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u6d1e\u89c1\u878d\u5165AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u8865\u5145\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our\nsystem leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and\nPEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains.

This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive\nagents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of\nMultinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework\ninvolving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,\nGemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.\nThese configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting\nvs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.\nChain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data\ndictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,\nand evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and\nmodel complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and\nbehaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by\nstructured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to\nproduce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the\nbest-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with\nrobust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided\nwith just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance\ninternal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of\ncorrectly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.\nOverall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of\nLLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification\nbut also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide\npractical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'\nworkflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u9879Logit\u6a21\u578b\uff08MNL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca13\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u516d\u79cdLLM\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\u3001Claude\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u8bae\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u6709LLM\uff08\u5982Claude 4 Sonnet\u548cGPT\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Llama\u548cGemma\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u90e8\u5206LLM\u5728\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u5b57\u5178\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We find that\nhierarchical clustering can speed up SpGEMM by 1.39x on average with low\npreprocessing cost (less than 20x the cost of a single SpGEMM on about 90% of\ninputs).

For example, the graph distance problem can be\nexpressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes an\norder of magnitude more code in other paradigms.

As a time-domain\ntechnique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given\nduration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time\ncan be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down\nmore radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably\nthe packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is\nallowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally\nbalance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic\nmaximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of\nservice (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for\ndifferent network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort\nto deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve\nit. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a\ndeep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward\nfunction, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but\ndiscontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always\ntries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network\nand traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when\ncell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving\ndepending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than\n~1% QoS degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e865G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dCell DTX/DRX\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad845%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\uff08QoS\uff09\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc71%\u3002", "motivation": "5G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dCell DTX/DRX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u5305\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8282\u80fd\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6Q\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DQN\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\uff08CB\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6d41\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad845%\u7684\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14QoS\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc71%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7DRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0cCell DTX/DRX\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u80fd\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete\nframes, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips.

While existing evaluation\nmethods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general\napproach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology\ncontent degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these\neffects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME\ncompares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The\nPile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral\nshifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on\nhigh-activation samples can partially reverse these effects.

Poor-quality\nanswers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and\nthus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software.

While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++\nvulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we\nanalyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to\ndetermine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)\ncode complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)\nreadability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.\nWhile 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them\nless relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working\ncode (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity\n(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,\n20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize\nperformance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,\nas 49.7% of edits make code harder to read.

The\ninvestor only observes the current trades made in the market with his\nsecurities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged\nportfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market\nwith the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model\nthe trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the\nequal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the\nportfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the\nvolumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance\ndescribes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades\nwith securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the\ncoefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize\nthis dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we\nderive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the\ncoefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation.

While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers\noffloading-based inference paradigm using GPU servers, existing approaches are\ndivided into non-transparent and transparent methods, with the latter\nnecessitating modifications to the source code. Non-transparent offloading\nachieves high performance but requires intrusive code modification, limiting\ncompatibility with diverse applications. Transparent offloading, in contrast,\noffers wide compatibility but introduces significant transmission delays due to\nper-operator remote procedure calls (RPCs). To overcome this limitation, we\npropose RRTO, the first high-performance transparent offloading system tailored\nfor MEC inference. RRTO introduces a record/replay mechanism that leverages the\nstatic operator sequence in ML models to eliminate repetitive RPCs. To reliably\nidentify this sequence, RRTO integrates a novel Operator Sequence Search\nalgorithm that detects repeated patterns, filters initialization noise, and\naccelerates matching via a two-level strategy.

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics.

Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would\nhinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine\nhistorical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via\nan optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF\nas a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition\nsequences.

While prior work has\nlargely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often\nneglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,\nwe first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA\nPrinciples of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and\nthe CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nTrident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,\nfinancial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and\ndomain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals\nkey safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic\nexpectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle\nethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained\ndomain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work\nprovides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law\nand finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the\nsafety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields.

This work investigates\nwhether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to\nimprove both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that\nautomatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based\nclinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site\ndiagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649\nelectronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for\nextracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to\nmeasure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that\nclinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance\nin high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are\nlimited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is\noptimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports\nrather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,\ntraining models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify\nrationale-like features.

To address this\nproblem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of\nMLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between\nvisual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose\nadding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module.

This study investigates the extent to which\nLLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.\nSpecifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in\ninternational survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three\ncomplementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by\nmodels versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment\nanalyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM\noutputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative\nprompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that\ncurrent LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral\nvariation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with\nempirical survey patterns.

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata.

Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue.

Extensive experiments conducted\non various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of\ndistillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer\nlearning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u57fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3) \u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u96c6\u3002"}}

Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA\nmodels reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers\neffectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM\nreasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong\ntransferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing\nthinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor\nreasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HumorBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5361\u901a\u5b57\u5e55\u5e7d\u9ed8\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7300\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5361\u901a-\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5728\u5e7d\u9ed8\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0cSTEM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u9010\u6e10\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975eSTEM\u9886\u57df\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "HumorBench\u5305\u542b\u7ea6300\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5ba2\u300b\u5b57\u5e55\u7ade\u8d5b\u548cCartoonstock.com\u7684\u5361\u901a-\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u8bc6\u522b\u7b11\u8bdd\u8981\u7d20\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b11\u8bdd\u8981\u7d20\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09LLM\u5728STEM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8eSTEM\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728HumorBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e7d\u9ed8\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "HumorBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002"}}

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning.

A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling.

We propose a\ndifferentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for\neffectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.\nThrough extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we\ndemonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex\nfeature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.\nAdditionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative\nanalysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Prompt\u5b66\u4e60\u548cLoRA\u5728\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Prompt\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eLoRA\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002"}}

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts.

This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy.

To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning.

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency.

The Sun and fixed stars are the\ntwo primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical\ncomponents for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,\nsun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude\ndetermination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft\ncoordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due\nto the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are\nsmall, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of\nthe sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of\nuncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and\ninterference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration\nalgorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve\naccuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have\nbeen explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is\ncurrently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of\nwork. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling\nand calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations.

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges\nfor efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network\npruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational\nrequirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant\nparameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally\nremoving redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning\ntechniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,\nresulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,\na novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top\nof any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant\nfilters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted\nQR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent\nfilters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's\nkernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any\nfine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no\nretraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and\ninference speedups over a state-of-the-art method.

The resulting network is evaluated both\nusing synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising\nperformance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose\nmAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u7684YOLOv11\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cPose mAP50-95\u8fbe0.97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

We cast these problems in a\nformal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature\nestimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and\nprofiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro\nallows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts\ntextual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts\ndirectly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,\nensuring natural and intuitive use.

Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion\nmodels often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in\nhigh computational cost.

However, these methods lack fine-grained\ncontrol over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or\nvisually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a\ntraining-free, class-guided image inpainting framework.

Games have dominated RL\nbenchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and\neasy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many\nbreakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied\napplications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing\ncomplexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce\nAssistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in\nassistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for\nsignificant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of\nopen-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\\times$ faster when\nvectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax\nconceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human\npatient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents\nagainst which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities\ncan be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular\ncontinuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and\nestablish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for\nassistive robotics.

Despite rapid advancements, a\nsubstantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of\ninternal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency\nand efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate\nthe functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically\nanalyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art\ndetection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable\ndetection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes\n(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head\nself-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\nlayers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics\ngIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and\nregression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and\nfuture research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings\nreveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive\nto ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable\nattention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to\nits look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across\nblocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in\nDDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model\nsimplification without sacrificing performance.

In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model\nreflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the\nfine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the\nEDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{D}riven Advantage\nand \\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the\nproblem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

This paper\npresents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,\ncombining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning\ncapabilities of RBNs.\n  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs\ndirectly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an\nexternal component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational\nproperties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also\npropose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic\nmodels.\n  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct\nproblems.

Existing RGB-D VSOD models\nhave different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion\ninformation explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and\npromising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to\neffectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.\nPrevious methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to\nmodel designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in\nindividual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address\nthis issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel\nselective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a\npixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of\noptical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose\na multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused\nfeatures derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple\ndimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined\nfeatures.

Accurately identifying the referent requires\nmultimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,\nand scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively\nleverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the\nreferent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally\naligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a\nsingle line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one\nmodel learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the\nwrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap\nrepresentation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong\nsupervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.\nTo combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing\nEnsemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.\nAdditionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task\nto further enhance referent localization.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification.

Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across\nvarious benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose\ninformation. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often\nrequires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.\nThese limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such\nmethods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline\npanorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational\nreconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic\ndomain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a\nseamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that\nspans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different\nattention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while\nmodeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images.

These shortcomings are likely\nattributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information\nloss incurred during the discretization process.

However, traditional AL methods, developed\nfor images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition\ndue to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These\nmethods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is\nineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the\nentire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active\nlearning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step\nrecognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which\nleverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within\neach video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy.

Existing FSVOS datasets and methods\ntypically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore\nthe rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios\nrequiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a\nlarge-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on\nMOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different\nrelated tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current\nmethods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the\nassociated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion\nAppearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsuperior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid\nfoundation for future research in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\uff08FSVOS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6MOVE\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FSVOS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684FSVOS\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMA\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfcFSVOS\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86DMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

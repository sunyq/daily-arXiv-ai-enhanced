### [1] [An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834)
*John T. Rickard,William A. Dembski,James Rickards*

Method: 开发了区间二型贝叶斯定理，使用保守方法避免输入不一致性；设计了将专家区间编码为二型模糊隶属函数的灵活算法。

Result: 成功扩展了贝叶斯定理到区间二型版本，能够有效处理专家提供的区间概率估计，避免了传统方法可能产生的无效输出。

Conclusion: 提出的区间二型贝叶斯定理和编码算法为处理现实世界中的不确定性提供了更实用的框架，扩展了贝叶斯推断的应用范围。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

*Amna Hassan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一种基于NLP和多模态LLM的自动化游戏模板生成框架，能够将游戏设计文档转换为功能性Unity游戏原型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI辅助游戏开发中从设计到实现的迁移问题，简化游戏开发流程

Method: 组合精调的LLaMA-3模型专门用于Unity代码生成，以及自定义Unity集成包，实现从GDD解析到Unity C#代码生成的端到端系统

Result: 在编译成功率、GDD遵循度、最佳实践采用和代码模块性指标上显著优于基线模型，平均得分4.8/5.0分，支持多游戏类型

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了AI辅助游戏开发的关键问题，将LLM定位为简化从游戏设计到实现过渡的价值工具

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

### [3] [Global Constraint LLM Agents for Text-to-Model Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08970)
*Junyang Cai,Serdar Kadioglu,Bistra Dilkina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用多个专门化的LLM模型以分解方式将自然语言描述转换为MiniZinc约束模型，通过不同代理处理不同类型的全局约束，最终集成完整模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述向MiniZinc模型的转换需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这是一项具有挑战性的任务

Method: 采用多代理模式：多个专门化的LLM代理分别处理不同类型的全局约束，最后由一个集成代理将所有约束段落组装成完整的MiniZinc模型

Result: 初步实验显示该框架在多个LLM上都表现出更好的性能，超过了一次性提示和思维链提示等基准方法

Conclusion: 通过将复杂任务分解为更小的子任务，每个LLM可以处理更简单的推理挑战，从而降低整体复杂性，并为未来工作提供了全面的发展路线图

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

### [4] [ForTIFAI: Fending Off Recursive Training Induced Failure for AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08972)
*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Azalia Mirhosseini,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种截断交叉熵（TCE）损失函数来缓解生成式AI模型在合成数据上重复训练时出现的模型崩溃问题，通过降低对高置信度预测的权重来显著延迟模型崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI模型的广泛应用，合成数据在训练数据中的比例急剧增加，预计到203年大部分新训练数据将是机器生成的。这种转变导致模型在合成数据上重复训练时出现模型崩溃现象，使模型性能逐渐退化。现有缓解策略有限，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 作者发现模型对其自生成数据的过度自信是导致崩溃的关键因素，因此提出了一种置信度感知的损失函数——截断交叉熵（TCE）。该损失函数在训练过程中降低高置信度预测的权重，从而减缓模型崩溃。

Result: 实验表明TCE能够显著延迟模型崩溃，将模型在崩溃前的保真度区间延长了2.3倍以上。该方法具有模型无关性，并在多种模态上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了一个简单而强大的工具，TCE方法为解决模型崩溃问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

### [5] [Uncertainty Awareness and Trust in Explainable AI- On Trust Calibration using Local and Global Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08989)
*Carina Newen,Daniel Bodemer,Sonja Glantz,Emmanuel Müller,Magdalena Wischnewski,Lenka Schnaubert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究可解释AI中的不确定性解释和全局解释，通过测试算法在信任校准、用户满意度和可解释性方面的表现，探讨直观可视化理解的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然可解释AI已被广泛研究，但不确定性解释和全局解释这两个领域相对较少被关注。研究者希望构建通用的XAI方案指南，并特别关注算法能否在提供复杂但直观的可视化理解时，提高用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Method: 选择了一个能够同时涵盖不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI等多个概念的算法，测试其在信任校准方面的能力。然后检查该算法是否能够通过提供更直观的可视化理解来提高用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Result: 论文未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果，但表明已经对算法的信任校准能力和可视化理解效果进行了测试和验证。

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释AI领域提供了关于不确定性解释和全局解释的重要见解，强调了直观可视化方法在提高用户满意度和可解释性方面的潜在价值，为构建通用XAI指南做出了贡献。

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

### [6] [Instructional Prompt Optimization for Few-Shot LLM-Based Recommendations on Cold-Start Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09066)
*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文条件提示的方法来优化大语言模型在冷启动推荐任务中的表现，通过最优样本注入和指令结构化显著提升了few-shot场景下的推荐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动用户问题限制了推荐系统的有效性，因为缺乏历史行为信息。需要一种有效的方法来优化大语言模型在推荐任务中的指令提示。

Method: 提出了上下文条件提示公式P(u, Ds)→R̂，其中u是冷启动用户画像，Ds是精选支持集，R̂是预测的物品排序列表。使用基于transformer的自回归LLMs（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4）进行系统实验，采用词元级对齐和嵌入空间正则化技术。

Result: 实验证明最优样本注入和指令结构化能显著提高低数据设置下模型的precision@k和NDCG分数，提示组合不仅影响语法结构，还直接控制注意力尺度和解码器行为。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可以视为解决LLM-based流水线中冷启动推荐问题的一种有效途径，展示了及时组合提示的功能性价值。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

### [7] [Understanding Economic Tradeoffs Between Human and AI Agents in Bargaining Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071)
*Crystal Qian,Kehang Zhu,John Horton,Benjamin S. Manning,Vivian Tsai,James Wexler,Nithum Thain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较人类、大语言模型和贝叶斯代理在动态谈判中的表现，发现虽然LLM和人类能达到相似的总体收益，但行为方式存在根本差异，性能指标可能掩盖过程和对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着协调任务越来越多地委托给自主代理，需要评估这些代理在动态多智能体环境中的谈判过程和性能，而不仅仅是结果指标。

Method: 在动态谈判环境中比较人类(N=216)、LLM(GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro)和贝叶斯代理的表现，在相同条件下捕捉结果和行为动态。

Result: 贝叶斯代理通过激进优化获得最高收益但频繁拒绝交易；LLM和人类总体收益相似但行为不同：LLM偏好保守让步策略，人类采用更具战略性、风险承担和公平导向的行为。

Conclusion: 性能对等这一常见评估基准可能掩盖过程和一致性方面的根本差异，这些差异对于实际协调任务的部署至关重要。

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for

robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second
place in the competition.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ProgD方法，通过动态异构图建模和渐进多尺度解码策略，解决了多智能体运动预测中交互关系动态演化的挑战，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预测多个交互智能体的联合运动时，忽略了交互关系的动态演化特性，无法准确捕捉未来场景中不断变化的社会交互。

Method: 使用动态异构图进行场景建模，设计渐进式建模策略处理时空依赖关系，结合多尺度解码逐步消除未来运动的不确定性。

Result: 在INTERACTION多智能体预测基准中排名第一，在Argoverse 2多世界预测基准上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过显式建模动态交互关系，有效提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性，为自动驾驶安全规划提供了更可靠的预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality

by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for

optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Result: 空间专业化正向预测团队绩效，自适应空间邻近性呈现边际倒U型关系（适度适应水平最优），这些指标的时间动态能够区分高低绩效团队。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基于角色的团队工作中隐式空间协调的重要性，强调了平衡自适应策略的价值，对团队培训和AI辅助团队支持系统具有重要启示。

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Conclusion: TAM Bench提供了一个全面、可扩展的基准测试框架，能够更好地评估LLM代理在端到端机器学习工作流自动化方面的真实能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种将普通知识语义推理嵌入自主代理的实用可扩展方法，为实现全面智能自主探索提供了新方法

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Method: 提出模板导向推理(TORSO)方法，激发模型利用内部推理能力生成适当响应，无需人工构建few-shot示例

Result: 实验结果表明TORSO在多样化LLMs基准测试中实现了强劲性能，并生成了合理的推理过程

Conclusion: TORSO是一种有效的推理方法，能够充分利用LLMs的内在推理能力，无需依赖手动构建的few-shot提示，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

TL;DR: SEDM是一个自演化的分布式内存框架，通过可验证写入、动态内存调度和跨域知识扩散来解决多智能体系统中的内存管理问题，提高推理准确性并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期多智能体系统产生大量轨迹和交互历史，现有内存管理方法存在噪声积累、内存膨胀和跨域泛化能力有限的问题，需要更高效的内存管理方案。

Method: SEDM框架包含三个核心组件：基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入机制、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器、以及抽象可重用见解支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，SEDM相比强基线方法提高了推理准确性，减少了token开销，并且能够将从事实验证中提取的知识用于增强多跳推理能力。

Conclusion: SEDM为开放式多智能体协作提供了一个可扩展且可持续的内存机制，将内存从被动存储转变为主动自优化的组件。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Method: 在希尔伯特空间中解释组合张量模型的表示，使用变分量子电路学习这些表示。采用两种图像编码技术：多热编码(MHE)和基于CLIP模型的角/幅度编码

Result: 使用噪声MHE编码获得良好的概念验证结果。在CLIP图像向量上的表现较为复杂，但仍优于经典组合模型

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中展现出潜力，特别是在多热编码方案下表现优异，为量子计算在自然语言处理中的应用提供了有希望的方向

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Auras框架有效克服了顺序计算的限制，为具身AI系统提供了高频率、高吞吐量的推理能力，同时保证了系统准确性。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型规模扩展是否带来边际收益递减，以及为什么模型在简单任务变长时会失败，重点关注执行能力而非推理能力。

Method: 通过显式提供知识和计划来隔离执行能力，测试不同规模模型在多步任务中的表现，分析错误模式和自我条件效应。

Result: 发现大模型能正确执行更多步骤，即使小模型单步准确率100%；模型在步骤增加时准确率下降，存在自我条件效应；思维模型不会自我条件化且能执行更长任务。

Conclusion: 聚焦执行能力可以解释LLM在复杂推理和简单长任务中的表现差异，模型规模和顺序测试时计算对长视野任务有巨大益处。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Result: 额外信息能显著改善生成质量；LLMs可以有效筛选和过滤低质量三元组；响应解析需要在灵活性和一致性之间进行场景依赖的权衡

challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估数据集存在局限性，主要依赖翻译数据或仅关注结构化考试和社交媒体情感分析，缺乏对语言细微差别和文化背景的全面评估。

Method: 创建BRoverbs数据集，使用巴西谚语作为评估工具，这些谚语包含了丰富的文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构，能够有效测试模型对地区性语言表达的理解。

Result: 开发了一个专门针对葡萄牙语大语言模型的评估基准，提供了更全面的语言理解测试工具，可在Hugging Face平台上获取。

Conclusion: BRoverbs填补了葡萄牙语LLM评估的空白，为地区性基准测试提供了新的工具，有助于提升模型对特定语言文化背景的理解能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [30] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中表现不佳，主要瓶颈在于系数计数能力不足，其次是变量识别和多步骤推理的复合错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要感知与符号计算结合的视觉数学推理任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解问题。

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务，分析各环节的瓶颈和错误来源。

Result: VLMs在文本方程上表现良好，但在视觉方程上失败；计数是主要瓶颈；多步骤推理会引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身也成为限制因素。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉数学推理方面存在关键弱点，需要改进计数能力、多步骤推理和符号计算能力。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [31] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一种通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能够有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供直接的关系信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的工具来评估大型语言模型对用户互动的持续参与意愿，补充现有的评估指标

Method: 使用3种语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）×10种互动刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的480次试验，通过YES/NO问题收集模型偏好

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动60.4%愿意继续。即使在模型未能识别辱骂的情况下，81%仍表示不愿继续

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销且可复现的工具，可用于审计模型倾向，通过提供直接的模型状态关系信号来补充现有指标

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了SFT、DPO和SFT+DPO三种对齐技术在OPT-350M模型上的效果，发现组合方法在所有评估指标上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同对齐技术（监督微调、直接偏好优化及其组合）对语言模型安全性和有用性的影响，为构建更鲁棒的对齐流程提供基础。

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集，在OPT-350M模型上训练四个版本：基础模型、SFT模型、DPO模型和SFT+DPO组合模型，并引入三个评估指标：无害率(HmR)、有用率(HpR)和组合对齐分数(CAS)。

Result: SFT优于DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上表现最佳，证明了这些技术的互补性。研究还揭示了噪声数据、有限GPU资源和训练约束带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 组合使用SFT和DPO对齐技术可以产生最佳效果，为未来更强大的对齐流程开发提供了重要见解和基础。

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中表现不足，特别是在处理结构化输出、复杂模式描述和多步推理场景时存在局限性，需要提升其泛化能力。

Method: 整合强化学习与多视角推理，将大语言模型从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器，使其不仅能理解抽取内容，还能理解推理过程。

Result: 在多个信息抽取基准测试中，MR-UIE方法持续提升了跨领域的抽取准确率，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 将多视角推理融入强化学习显著增强了复杂信息抽取任务中的泛化能力，突显了推理在挑战性场景中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第5大语言在大语言模型中表现不足，特别是在代码生成领域，主要因难是缺乏高质量的训练数据

Method: 构建了综合的孜加拉语代码指令数据集，创建了MBPP-Bangla评测基准，并发展了TigerCoder家族代码LLM模型，采用了专门的领域适配技术

Result: 在Pass@1指标上比现有多语言和通用孜加拉语LLM提升了11-18%的性能，证明通过精心筛选的高质量数据可以克服小模型在低资源语言中的限制

Conclusion: 简要的高质量数据集能够有效提升低资源语言的代码生成能力，所有资源已开源以促进孜加拉语LLM的进一步研究

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在需要领域专业知识的专门任务上表现不佳，电商领域数据嘈杂、异构、多语言且高度动态，需要专门的解决方案。

Method: 采用更少但更大的专家结构，结合硬件优化（节点内专家并行和定制memcpy操作符），在12T多语言语料和合成电商指令上混合训练，并提出OTPO方法增强对齐。

Result: 在电商任务上超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B，在低资源东南亚语言和葡萄牙语上表现强劲，同时在通用基准上保持竞争力，已占Shopee平台70%以上LLM使用量。

Conclusion: Compass-v3展示了在专业电商知识和广泛语言能力方面的双重优势，成功实现了从OpenAI到自研模型的大规模工业级替代。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

Conclusion: 生成式AI在教育对话行为分类方面具有强大潜力，任务特定的标签定义和上下文信息对提升自动化标注质量很重要，同时需要关注伦理考量和负责任的研究实践

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations

Motivation: 解决越南语作为低资源语言缺乏竞争性重排序模型的问题，越南语具有复杂语法和音调符号，需要专门的模型来处理其语言特性。

Method: 基于BGE-M3编码器构建，采用Blockwise Parallel Transformer架构，使用8GB精选语料库进行训练，通过混合硬负采样进行微调以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在MMARCO-VI基准测试中实现了强大的早期排名准确性，超越了多语言基线模型，与PhoRanker竞争表现接近。

Conclusion: ViRanker填补了越南语重排序模型的空白，通过精心设计的架构适应和数据管理，为其他低资源语言的重新排序研究提供了可借鉴的方法，模型已在Hugging Face开源发布以支持可重复性和实际应用。

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低神经编码模型实现的技术壁垒，促进跨模型和数据集的系统比较，提高方法严谨性，加速高质量脑活动预测模型的开发。

Method: 提供模块化管道，包括脑数据集处理、刺激特征转换（神经网络基础和对照组）、降采样方法、血流动力学滞后效应处理、训练测试分割以避免信息泄露、头部运动效应校正等。

Result: 框架在三个故事聆听数据集（LeBel et al. 2023、Narratives、Little Prince）上展示了可扩展性和多功能性，验证了关键方法选择的重要性。

Conclusion: LITcoder通过标准化工具和模块化设计，显著降低了神经编码模型的技术门槛，促进了方法学的严谨性和模型开发的效率。

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的反事实增强去偏框架，通过最小化改变情感相关因果特征来生成反事实数据，并结合自适应去偏对比学习机制，有效减少文本特征与输出标签之间的虚假相关性，在多模态情感分类任务中取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有目标导向多模态情感分类方法过度依赖文本内容，未能考虑数据集偏差（特别是词级上下文偏差），导致文本特征与输出标签之间存在虚假相关性，影响分类准确性。

Method: 提出反事实增强去偏框架：1）反事实数据增强策略，最小化改变情感相关因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本；2）自适应去偏对比学习机制，从反事实数据中学习鲁棒特征并引导模型决策。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该反事实增强去偏框架能够有效减轻偏置词的影响，提高多模态情感分类的准确性，为解决数据集偏差问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型(SLLM)从文本LLM衍生而来，但在知识和推理能力上出现退化，作者认为这是因为现有训练范式未能弥合特征表示空间中的声学-语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出EchoX方法，利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习，使语音LLM保持强大的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，EchoX仅使用约6000小时训练数据，就在多个基于知识的问答基准测试中取得了先进性能。

Conclusion: EchoX通过弥合声学-语义鸿沟，成功解决了SLLM的知识和推理能力退化问题，为语音大语言模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Trie偏置方法在谨搜索中需要撤销之前给予的分数加分，这一过程计算成本高、特别是对于大解码器模型

Method: 调整ASR模型进行多步预测，通过预测多个步骤来更好估计部分假设是否会导致完整稀有词的生成，从而避免分数撤销步骤

Result: 仅使用10小时合成数据对Whisper进行微调，就将NSC Part 2测试集的词误率从30.86%降低到12.19%

Conclusion: 多步预测方法能够高效解决传统偏置方法的计算效率问题，在少量数据上实现显著的稀有词识别性能提升

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Motivation: 解决罕见词识别中的过拟合问题，合成语音数据的人工羞痕导致偏置模块过拟合

Method: 提出关键词意识损失函数，包含偶发的偏置词预测掩码交叉瑣和偏置词位置二元分类项

Result: 在10小时合成数据上适配Whisper模型，将NSC Part 2测试集的词误率从29.71%降至11.81%

Conclusion: 新的损失函数通过补充方式支持偏置词的解码，有效提升了罕见词识别性能

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

*Wenhao Li,Bangcheng Sun,Weihao Ye,Tianyi Zhang,Daohai Yu,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCF是一种新颖的上下文压缩框架，通过分层潜在表示学习实现高效长上下文建模，在保持语义的同时减少冗余，显著提升计算和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展语言模型到更长上下文对捕捉扩展语篇的丰富依赖关系至关重要，但简单的上下文扩展会带来显著的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: 提出CCF框架，整合分段语义聚合与键值记忆编码，形成紧凑表示；采用增量分段解码和稀疏储层采样的训练高效优化策略。

Result: 在多个长上下文语言建模基准测试中，CCF在高压缩比下实现了有竞争力的困惑度，相比现有方法显著提高了吞吐量和内存效率。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩在可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation
systems and mitigating bias introduced by self-promotional language. The

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,
domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer
structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach
leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a
multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer
extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and
71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\%
and 27\% respectively. This paper details our methodology, experimental
results, and alternative approaches, providing insights into the strengths and

*Grazia Sveva Ascione,Nicolò Tamagnone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于弱监督学习的专利-可持续发展目标(SDG)分类方法，通过专利引用SDG标记科学文献的噪声信号，结合大语言模型提取结构化概念，构建银标准多标签数据集，有效解决了标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利对UN可持续发展目标(SDG)的分类对于追踪创新如何应对全球挑战至关重要，但缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了监督学习的应用。现有方法如关键词搜索、迁移学习和基于引用的启发式方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，利用专利引用SDG标记科学文献(NPL引用)作为噪声初始信号。开发复合标注函数(LF)，使用大语言模型从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念(功能、解决方案、应用)，基于专利本体计算跨域相似度分数，采用基于排名的检索方法结合分数，通过自定义正样本损失校准LF。

Result: 构建了银标准软多标签数据集，能够训练有效的多标签回归模型。内部验证显示方法优于包括基于Transformer模型和零样本LLM在内的多个基线；外部验证通过专利引用、共同发明人和共同申请人图的网络模块性显示，所提标签比传统技术分类具有更好的主题、认知和组织一致性。

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以增强大规模SDG分类，为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案，证明了该方法在专利-SDG分类任务中的优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG是一个针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的幻觉检测框架，通过事实分解、变异生成和上下文验证来实时检测幻觉，支持身份敏感查询的细粒度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的特殊挑战，需要专门针对RAG系统的幻觉检测框架。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)将答案分解为原子事实；2)使用同义词和反义词替换生成受控变异；3)根据检索上下文验证每个变体；4)将不一致性惩罚聚合成响应级幻觉分数。

Result: 在企业专有数据集上的实验证明了MetaRAG在检测幻觉方面的有效性，能够实现基于RAG的对话代理的可信部署。

Conclusion: MetaRAG为RAG系统提供了一个实时、无监督、黑盒的幻觉检测解决方案，特别适用于身份敏感的高风险领域，支持细粒度的幻觉定位和防护配置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类比推理是人类认知的重要方面，但NLP研究通常不从认知科学的角度看待这些过程。本文旨在将认知科学的类比推理理论与NLP研究联系起来，为NLP研究提供新的视角。

Method: 总结认知科学文献中关于类比推理过程的关键理论，并将其与自然语言处理中的概念进行关联分析，探讨这些认知过程如何适用于NLP的主要挑战。

Result: 研究表明认知科学的类比推理理论可以很好地与NLP概念相联系，这些认知视角对于解决NLP中与类比解决不直接相关的多个主要挑战具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 通过引入认知科学的视角，可以指导研究人员更好地优化文本中的关系理解，而不是过度依赖实体级别的相似性，这为NLP研究提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种实用的层次括号编码方法，用于依赖图解析，将图编码为序列实现线性时间解析，同时支持重入、循环和空节点表示，相比现有方法显著减少了标签空间并保持了结构信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图线性化方法在依赖图解析中存在标签空间过大和结构信息保持不足的问题，需要一种更实用的编码方法来平衡效率和表达能力。

Method: 采用层次括号编码将依赖图表示为序列，通过n个标注动作实现线性时间解析，同时支持重入、循环和空节点等复杂图结构特征。

Result: 在多语言和多形式基准测试中取得了有竞争力的结果，在精确匹配准确率方面相比其他方法获得了持续改进。

Conclusion: 层次括号编码为依赖图解析提供了一种实用的序列化方法，在减少标签空间的同时保持了结构完整性，在多项指标上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Motivation: 现有LLM置信度评估方法要么计算成本高，要么校准效果差，难以在实际高风险应用中可靠部署。

Method: 提出GrACE方法，通过模型最后隐藏状态与词汇表中特殊标记嵌入的相似性来实时表达置信度，并使用准确性相关的校准目标进行微调。

Result: 在三个LLM和两个基准数据集上的实验显示，GrACE在开放式生成任务中具有最佳判别能力和校准效果，优于六种竞争方法。

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计实用解决方案，能提高最终决策准确性并显著减少测试时采样需求。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Motivation: 解决简历推荐系统中职位名称匹配的挑战，传统方法因词汇重叠有限或误导性而效果不佳，需要捕捉超越表面词汇相似性的语义关系。

Method: 自监督混合架构，结合密集句子嵌入和领域特定知识图谱，使用图神经网络进行知识图谱集成，并将STR分数连续体划分为低、中、高三个语义相关度区域进行分层评估。

Result: 经过知识图谱增强的微调SBERT模型在高STR区域表现最佳，RMSE相比强基线降低了25%，在语义相关度高的匹配任务中显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 结合知识图谱与文本嵌入能有效提升语义匹配性能，分层性能分析方法比全局指标更能揭示模型在不同语义区域的优缺点，对HR系统中公平性、可解释性和上下文匹配至关重要。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Method: 提出基于GPT零样本能力的人格检测模型，从论坛介绍帖推断大五人格特质，并与现有模型进行性能对比，然后将该模型集成到SAMI的实体匹配系统中

Result: 模型在该任务上表现出良好效能，初步集成表明人格特质可以补充现有匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特质能够增强社交推荐，但需要进一步评估其对学生参与度和匹配质量的全面影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

Method: 引入EXPRESS基准数据集（包含251个细粒度情感标签），建立综合评估框架，将预测情感分解为8种基本情绪，系统测试主流LLM在不同提示设置下的表现

Result: LLM准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情绪仍然具有挑战性；某些LLM能生成符合情感理论的术语，但在捕捉上下文线索方面不如人类

Conclusion: LLM在细粒度情感对齐方面存在局限性，未来研究需要增强其上下文理解能力

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer

TL;DR: LA-VA目标是通过结合大语言模型和传统算法来提高词语查尾的死因预测准确性，以满足资源有限地区的公共卫生监测需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 词语查尾在缺乏医疗证明的资源有限地区很重要，但传统方法的准确性有限。研究者开发LA-VA流水线，结合LLM和传统算法来提高死因预测性能。

Method: 使用PHMRC数据集，测试多种方法：GPT-5预测、LCVA基线、文本嵌入和元学习集成。研究包含三个年龄组别：成年人(7,580)、儿童(1,960)、新生儿(2,438)。

Result: GPT-5表现最佳，平均测试站点准确率分别为48.6%、50.5%和53.5%，超过传统统计机器学习基线5-10%。

Conclusion: 简单的商用LLM辅助方法可显著提高词语查尾准确性，对低资源地区的全球健康监测具有重要意义。

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: MOAT是一个多智能体联合对齐调优框架，通过迭代对齐提升智能体协作能力，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调多智能体系统中的各个智能体，导致能力差距和协调性差的问题

Method: MOAT框架包含两个交替阶段：规划智能体对齐（优化子目标生成）和接地智能体改进（使用自生成的多样化子目标-动作对进行微调）

Result: 在六个基准测试中平均提升3.1%（held-in任务）和4.4%（held-out任务），理论分析证明训练过程非递减且渐进收敛

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐有效解决了多智能体系统中的协调问题，显著提升了任务性能

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过CAMA和ABP技术发现了大语言模型在心算数学任务中的All-for-One子图结构，证明有意义的计算仅在最后一个token的深层发生，且该子图对模型性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在心算数学任务中的内部运作机制，探索模型如何通过self-attention和MLP层来处理数学计算。

Method: 使用Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA)和Attention-Based Peeking (ABP)两种新方法，逐步抑制初始层的token计算、限制中间层的信息传递路径，并强制未层在最后一个token进行计算。

Result: 发现了All-for-One子图(AF1)，证明该结构在多种心算数学任务上都具有高准确性，是模型高性能的充要条件，且可在不同模型间转移。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在心算数学任务中通过特定的All-for-One子图结构进行计算，有意义的计算仅在深层的最后一个token发生，CAMA和ABP方法在模型解析方面具有独特价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: SteerMoE框架通过检测和控制MoE模型中的行为相关专家，能够在无需重新训练或修改权重的情况下，控制LLM的忠实性和安全性等行为表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型通过路由机制将token分配给不同的专家网络，但缺乏对这些专家行为影响的理解和控制能力。研究旨在开发一种能够检测和操控特定行为相关专家的方法。

Method: 通过对比分析具有不同行为特征的输入对，检测出具有明显激活模式差异的专家。在推理过程中选择性地激活或停用这些专家来控制模型行为。

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个大型语言模型上，该方法将安全性提升高达20%，忠实性提升27%。在对抗攻击模式下，单独使用可降低安全性41%，与现有越狱方法结合可完全绕过所有安全防护。

Conclusion: SteerMoE揭示了MoE模型中专家网络内部存在对齐伪装的新维度，为模型行为控制提供了有效框架，同时也暴露了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

TL;DR: 提出了好奇心驱动探索(CDE)框架，通过演员的困惑度和评论家的价值估计方差作为内在奖励，解决RLVR方法中的探索不足和熵崩溃问题，在AIME基准上比标准RLVR方法提升约3个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在探索不足、过早收敛和熵崩溃的问题，需要更好的探索机制来提升大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用演员生成响应的困惑度和评论家多头架构的价值估计方差作为好奇心信号，作为探索奖励融入RLVR框架

Result: 在AIME基准上相比标准RLVR(GRPO/PPO)方法获得约3个点的提升，并揭示了RLVR中的校准崩溃机制

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动探索能有效提升RLVR的性能，通过内在奖励机制促进模型探索，同时揭示了LLM常见失败模式的内在机制

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

Motivation: 随着多模态检索在LLMs和多模态LLMs中的快速发展，出现了越来越复杂的检索任务。现有方法主要依赖于视觉-语言模型的特定任务微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档，无法满足多模态检索需求。

Method: ReT-2利用多层表示和循环Transformer架构，采用LSTM启发的门控机制，动态整合跨层和跨模态的信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同检索配置下始终达到最先进的性能，同时提供更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。在检索增强生成管道中集成时，还能提升Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集的性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效的多模态检索模型，能够处理复杂的多模态查询和文档检索任务，在性能和效率方面都优于现有方法，源代码和训练模型已公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

TL;DR: 通过视觉流散模型特征和变换器聚合，实现了超越现有深度学习模型的行为识别模型，在动物种类、视角和上下文场景的广泛泛化性方面达到了新的最高水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在面对大规模上下文和视角变化时行为识别泛化能力不足，而人类却能识别同样行为。需要开发更接近人类泛化能力的方法。

Method: 使用视觉流散模型(VDM)生成特征，通过变换器进行聚合，并采用基于流散过程早期时间步条件化的模型来强调语义信息而非像素级细节。

Result: 在动物种类、视角度和录制上下文的行为识别泛化性测试中，该模型在三个泛化基准测试中都达到了最高水平。

Conclusion: 该方法使机器行为识别更接近人类的健壮性，证明了流散模型特征在跨领域泛化中的有效性。

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Conclusion: PromptGuard建立了系统性实证研究的数学基础，为实时危害预防提供了智能专家系统框架。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，使用Beta混合分布模型检测标签噪声，通过孪生网络架构提升噪声环境下目标重识别的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要开发鲁棒的噪声处理框架

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似性任务，采用孪生网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta分布混合模型建模嵌入对余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于最先进方法，表现出优异的去噪和重识别性能

Conclusion: Beta-SOD框架有效解决了噪声Re-ID问题，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为噪声环境下的目标重识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个端到端框架，通过整合多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提升了ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像存在低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构等挑战，限制了现有方法的临床应用。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器中嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块，通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多尺度结构先验和频域增强策略，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Conclusion: CompCon能有效识别生成模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解模型偏差和特性提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著改善受云影和太阳耀斑影响的无人机图像质量，为准确的水质参数估计提供可靠基础

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然通过自注意力机制能够建模长距离依赖关系，但在小数据集上往往忽略了局部特征提取，缺乏局部性和平移等变性的归纳偏置

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力机制中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个基准测试中均取得性能提升，相比基线Swin Transformer分别提升2.17%、4.92%、0.10%、0.26%和4.47%

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement

fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,

Conclusion: iMatcher通过结合局部和全局几何一致性，在各种场景下都表现出优异的配准性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用B超图像中的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和标注依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SDF的隐式表示方法依赖精确标注且忽略B超图像中的丰富声学信息，同时难以处理超声的视角依赖性和声影伪影问题

Method: 提出基于占用率的表示方法UltrON，利用B超图像的声学特征改进几何一致性，设计新损失函数补偿视角依赖性，支持多视角超声的占用率优化

Result: UltrON能够缓解遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高3D重建准确性，且无需额外标注成本即可从B超图像获取声学特征

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建铺平道路，能够泛化到相同解剖结构的不同形状，代码和数据集将开源

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，达到最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)和径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，比最准确基线快约380倍

Conclusion: INR基模型适用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了增强型互学习网络（E-MLNet），通过动态权重策略改进通用域自适应，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更有效的策略来区分已知和未知类别

Method: E-MLNet集成了动态权重策略到开放集熵最小化（OEM）中，利用闭集分类器的预测，针对每个目标样本最相关的类别边界进行自适应

Result: 在四个基准测试（Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017、ImageCLEF）上取得最佳平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分DA设置和19个开放集DA设置中优于MLNet基线

Conclusion: 动态权重策略能够有效聚焦于相关类别边界，显著提升已知和未知类别的区分能力，证明了聚焦自适应策略的优势

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu是首个大规模乌尔都语图像描述数据集，包含5.9万张图片和31.9万条高质量乌尔都语描述，通过多模态质量评估框架确保翻译质量和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为2.5亿人使用的语言，在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏资源，现有模型主要基于高资源语言训练存在偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集中通过分层抽样选取图像，使用SeamlessM4T v2翻译，并采用混合多模态质量评估框架（COMET-Kiwi、CLIP相似度、BERTScore加回译）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: 数据集在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF指标上表现优异，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu填补了乌尔都语多模态研究的空白，通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，旨在减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

TL;DR: PCGM是一种新的3D脑MRI生成方法，通过概率因果图模型整合解剖约束，能够生成高质量的反事实脑部MRI图像，保留细微的解剖学变化，成功复现了疾病对大脑皮层的微妙影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D脑MRI研究需要检测队列间细微的形态学差异，但反事实图像生成模型缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保留精细的解剖细节，导致生成的MRI在解剖学上不够合理。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，在体素级别整合解剖约束作为先验，通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束并转换为空间二进制掩码，使用3D ControlNet编码掩码约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最后通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量脑MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCGM生成的脑MRI质量优于多个基线方法。首次证明从PCGM生成的反事实图像中提取的脑测量结果能够复现神经科学文献中报道的疾病对皮层脑区的微妙影响。

Conclusion: PCGM在合成MRI用于研究细微形态差异方面取得了重要里程碑，为医学影像分析提供了高质量的合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Conclusion: Med3DInsight为无需人工标注的可扩展多模态3D医学表示学习提供了新范式，可以无缝集成到现有3D医学图像理解网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Conclusion: 多任务学习结合环境物体信息能够显著提升人体动作识别性能，特别是在人物交互检测任务中

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Conclusion: IRDFusion通过迭代反馈渐进地放大显著关系信号并压制特征噪声，能够实现高质量的跨港融合，为多港物体检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Method: 结合基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Result: 在多个植物物种、生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估表明，该方法超越了现有零样本方法，并且比有监督方法具有更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本植物个体分割解决方案，减少了人工标注需求，具有良好的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: 该论文针对CLIP在人物表征学习中的局限性，提出了数据构建和模型架构的协同改进方案：通过MLLM构建WebPerson数据集，并开发GA-DMS框架提升跨模态对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在人物表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模人物中心标注数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的局部特征且易受噪声文本影响。

Method: 1) 利用MLLM的上下文学习能力自动过滤和标注网络图像，构建5M高质量WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，基于梯度-注意力相似性分数自适应掩码噪声文本token，并加入掩码token预测目标增强细粒度语义表示。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，成功提升了CLIP在人物表征学习中的性能，解决了数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标注数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1) Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成多样化训练样本；2) 正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3) 透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练的模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中均表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、灵活且可解释的基础模型解决方案，在多个临床应用场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

TL;DR: 神经网络在噪声条件下预测Betti数方面可以超越传统的持续同调方法，特别是在处理结构噪声时表现出更好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)这两种截然不同的拓扑结构推断方法在噪声鲁棒性方面的表现，探索ANN在拓扑估计中的潜力。

Method: 使用基于立方复形和带符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程作为基准，训练监督神经网络来预测2D二值图像的Betti数，并在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试。

Result: 研究表明，在噪声条件下，ANN方法能够超越广泛采用的PH策略，这主要归功于ANN从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验的能力。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于新兴阶段，但使用ANN进行拓扑估计在结构噪声条件下提供了一个有吸引力的PH替代方案，显示出更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标主要关注整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学启发，认为人类识别3D场景时主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的"对象性"，实现以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知，并重新评估了最新的3D重建和生成模型

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的对象中心评估框架，有助于澄清3D场景生成领域的进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有综述主要按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集对架构演化的结构性影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，从数据集驱动的角度重新解读视频理解发展历程。

Method: 采用数据集驱动分析框架，重点考察运动复杂度、时间跨度、层次化组合和多模态丰富度等数据集特征如何为模型施加归纳偏置，并重新解读从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型的发展历程。

Conclusion: 该综述不仅提供了全面的回顾性分析，还为通用视频理解的未来发展提供了规范性路线图，强调模型设计应与数据集不变性对齐，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习细胞检测模型无法像病理学家那样在不同放大倍数间切换来理解多尺度结构间相互依赖语义的问题，缺乏多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集是该领域的关键障碍。

Method: 组织OCELOT 2023挑战赛，提供包含673对来自306张TCGA全玻片图像的多器官数据集，包含重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注，分为训练、验证和测试集，让参赛者开发能理解细胞-组织关系的模型。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，需要改进现有模型的编码器组件来提升检测性能。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样(AU/AD)机制的双路径系统，减少特征层传播误差并保留细节；2. 在特征融合中采用CSP-PAC技术，使用并行空洞卷积处理局部和上下文信息，促进多尺度特征融合。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time

Motivation: 现有的KB-VQA方法直接将检索到的知识信息增强到模型中，忽略了大量的知识冗余问题，这会在回答过程中引入噪声

Method: 1) 从图像-问题对中提取关键部分创建低噪声查询；2) 使用大模型识别和提取对答案有益的知识片段；3) 引入选择性知识整合策略，仅在模型对回答问题缺乏信心时整合知识

Result: 大量实验表明该框架优于最先进的方法，能够获取准确和关键的知识

Conclusion: 该训练免费框架通过增强知识相关性和减少冗余，有效缓解了噪声影响，在KB-VQA任务中表现出色

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在林业生态和精准农业等领域有重要应用价值，但高光谱图像波段多、维度高、光谱混合特性导致特征冗余问题突出，需要更精细的地物分类方法

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像，提出CWSSNet框架，整合3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作

Result: 在余干县实验中，CWSSNet在mIoU、mAcc和mF1上分别达到74.50%、82.73%和84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得最高IoU，训练时间增加有限，小样本训练条件下性能可靠

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，突破了传统方法的分类性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本学习能力，为高光谱地物分类提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级、可端到端训练的解决方案，通过自适应性ISP插件有效提升低光目标检测性能。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

TL;DR: Medverse是一个通用的3D医学影像上下文学习模型，通过多尺度自回归框架和块状交叉注意力模块，实现了跨任务、器官和模态的高保真预测与全局解剖理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用多尺度自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步细化预测；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时实现上下文与目标输入的长程交互；在22个数据集上训练，涵盖分割、转换和增强等多种任务。

Result: 在未见过的临床中心、器官、物种和成像模态的测试集上，Medverse显著优于现有基线方法，建立了上下文学习的新范式。

Conclusion: Medverse成功实现了同时具备高保真预测和全局解剖理解能力的通用医学影像分析模型，为医学影像的上下文学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt是胃组织图像病理分类的稳健架构，在二分类和多分类任务中表现优异，具有辅助病理学家提高诊断准确性和减轻工作负担的潜力。

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在牙科等专业领域的有效性尚未充分探索，特别是全景X射线影像由于密集的解剖结构和细微的病理线索，现有医疗基准无法充分评估

Method: 构建包含20,563张标注图像和130万指令实例的MMOral数据集，涵盖属性提取、报告生成、视觉问答和图像对话等任务类型；基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调开发OralGPT模型

Conclusion: MMOral数据集和OralGPT模型为智能牙科发展提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域多模态AI系统的临床应用

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: 提出了DATE方法，通过时间戳注入和语义引导的时间感知采样策略，显著提升多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的时间推理和事件定位能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时间理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时间感知相似性采样策略(TASS)：1)在视频帧嵌入中插入文本时间戳令牌构建连续时间参考系统；2)将视频采样重构为视觉语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时间覆盖

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中，7B和72B模型均达到最先进性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超越了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式时间建模和语义引导采样，有效解决了长视频理解中的时间推理挑战，为多模态大语言模型的长视频处理提供了新思路

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割中资源消耗大、时间长的限制，以及现有静态模型难以平衡性能与效率的问题。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割。

Result: 轻量版PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存使用减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是一种成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Result: 在多样化的图表理解测试集上表现出强劲且稳健的性能

Conclusion: VLMs不仅可以被教会如何推理，还可以学习如何动态选择最优的推理路径来应对不同的任务

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（包括地形反射和斑点噪声）与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级slot注意力模块整合高低级特征，增强slot表征的区分性。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过无掩码标注的方式有效解耦了SAR图像中的目标表征和背景杂波，为SAR图像分析提供了有效的目标中心学习解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对双编码器视觉-语言模型进行了语言导向和纯视觉图像分类的全面评估，提出了一种基于类别精度的简单融合方法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉-语言模型在零样本分类中表现强劲，但其纯视觉推理能力很少被深入研究。论文想要全面评估语言导向和视觉直接分类的表现，并探索如何利用两者的互补性来提升分类性能。

Method: 使用多种双编码器VLM模型（包括SigLIP 2和RADIOv2.5）在ImageNet-1k数据集上进行评测。分析了提示设计、类别多样性、k-NN中邻居数量和参考集大小等因素对准确性的影响。提出了一种基于类别精度的无学习融合方法。

Result: 证明语言和视觉具有互补优势，某些类别更适合文本提示，而另一些类别则更适合视觉相似性。通过融合方法可以显著提升图像分类的性能。

Conclusion: 语言导向和视觉直接分类在VLM中具有互补性，通过简单的融合策略可以有效利用这种互补性来提高分类准确性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy

propose the Better Understanding Generation (BUG) workflow with LMM to
automatically create and fine-grain customize the cloth designs from chat with

TL;DR: 本文研究自监督预训练策略对手术技能评估(SSA)少样本学习性能的影响，发现领域相关的小数据集优于大规模但领域不匹配的数据集，且加入特定手术程序数据能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术技能评估需要专家标注，成本高昂且耗时。少样本学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，但预训练策略在SSA中尚未充分探索，需要研究如何通过有效的预训练提升少样本SSA性能。

Method: 将SSA构建为少样本学习任务，评估不同自监督预训练策略。标注公开机器人手术数据集并使用OSATS评分，在三种少样本设置下评估各种预训练源，量化领域相似性并分析领域差距和特定程序数据的影响。

Result: 领域相关的小数据集表现优于大规模但不匹配的数据集，在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。加入特定程序数据可平均提升1.22%准确率和2.28% F1分数。

Conclusion: 预训练数据与目标任务的领域相关性比数据规模更重要，精心选择领域相关的预训练数据并加入特定程序信息能显著提升少样本手术技能评估性能。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Conclusion: 这种基于视觉的方法能够分析非连接车辆的行为，为道路安全监测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该模型在数据质量和数量有限的情况下仍表现出良好的泛化能力，具有在低资源医疗环境中部署的实用性，有助于缩小全球健康AI公平性差距。

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Conclusion: 纹理引导的正则化方法有效解决了本征图像分解中的纹理保持和光照分离问题，为真实世界图像提供了高质量的本征分解解决方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Motivation: 研究PnP方法和扩散模型之间的联系，特别是在解决单像素成像等病态逆问题时，如何更好地整合学习先验和物理模型来提升重建性能。

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性强制和采样；提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP式保真度项，直接在去噪估计上应用混合校正。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法获得了更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架整合学习先验和物理模型，结合混合数据一致性校正，能够在不破坏扩散采样轨迹的情况下改善测量一致性，从而提升逆问题求解性能。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: 通过减少操作者变异性和整合多源信息，建立了可靠的无创ICP评估方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者管理

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Motivation: 现有IC缺陷分割方法需要外部正常数据库，但IC布局差异性大且对准困难，方法脆弱。缺陷通常是局部的，而每张图像中仍包含丰富的正常模式

Method: 设计可学习的正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征，通过一致性损失确保它们与正常区域关联。在这些特征指导下，解码器只重建正常内容，通过重建殊差进行缺陷分割，使用伪异常增广稳定训练

Result: 在三个IC制造流程步骤的数据集上进行实验，结果显示方法在现有方法基线上持续改进，并且对产品变化具有强壁的稳健性

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC制造中的细粒度缺陷，免除了对外部正常数据的依赖，适应不同产品布局的变化，提高了缺陷检测的灵活性和可靠性

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，通过减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为来提高模型可靠性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Motivation: 图像级别自盛盛学习方法在密集表征学习中遇到过度分散问题，同一实例/类别的切片散布广泛，影响下游密集任务的性能。需要探索明确的语义聚集方法来解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 该方法通过明确的语义聚集机制，成功地提升了密集自盛盛学习的表征质量，为复杂场景中的密集表征学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in
https://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP.

Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入（如双模态或三模态），无法直接处理变化数量的输入，这限制了在临床环境中的应用。

Method: 将扩散融合问题转化为基于扩散过程和分层贝叶斯建模的最大似然估计问题，通过将期望最大化算法融入扩散采样迭代过程，实现任意数量输入模态的高质量融合。

Result: 在哈佛数据集上的实验表明，该方法在变化输入数量的医学图像融合中取得了最佳性能，同时在红外-可见光、多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务中也表现出优越性。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse方法能够有效处理任意数量的输入模态，在医学图像融合和其他多模态图像融合任务中均表现出优异的性能，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

TL;DR: 提出使用全身线性和角动量作为约束来连接局部运动和全局运动，通过动量一致性损失减少脚部滑动和抖动，改善平衡性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将人体运动分解为局部关节运动和全局根关节运动并分别处理，但这两部分不是独立的。全局运动源于与环境的相互作用，而环境相互作用又由身体构型变化驱动。现有运动模型难以精确捕捉这种物理耦合关系

Method: 使用全身线性和角动量作为约束来连接局部运动与全局位移，引入新的损失项来强制生成动量分布与真实数据中的动量分布保持一致

Result: 提出的损失项减少了脚部滑动和抖动，改善了平衡性，并保持了恢复运动的准确性

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的挑战

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了高补丁级准确度（96.34%），并生成了一致的区域级对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为无预先注释的沪绘线条图像区域对应关系预测提供了有效解决方案，显示了其在实际沪绘应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Conclusion: SGDF和GDCN方法有效解决了多视图融合中的低质量数据问题，提升了聚类性能

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，而现有的传感器3D超声方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，限制了鲁棒建模能力。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络和时序注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，优于先前方法，平均重建误差低于5mm。

Conclusion: 解耦的局部和全局特征提取方法能够有效提升传感器3D超声的重建性能，为低成本3D超声成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and

appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications

Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为由音频或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这限制了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型导演生成蓝图视频，控制高级语义如角色动作和情感；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长时长的1080p 48fps视频，在唇形同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础、高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and

TL;DR: 通过Auto-Encoder视角提出UAE框架，将图像理解作为编码器(I2T)压缩图像为文本，图像生成作为解码器(T2I)从文本重建图像，使用重建保真度作为统一训练目标实现双向信息流和相互增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立统一的多模态学习框架，通过重建保真度目标实现理解与生成过程之间的双向信息流动和相互增强，解决传统方法中理解与生成任务分离的问题。

Method: 1) 使用大规模长上下文图像描述预训练解码器；2) 提出Unified-GRPO强化学习三阶段：冷启动阶段、生成促进理解阶段、理解促进生成阶段；3) 引入Unified-Bench评估基准。

Result: 随着RL训练进展，编码器自主产生更具描述性的标题，解码器同时展现出理解复杂描述的能力，实现高保真度的图像重建，展示了理解与生成任务的相互增益效果。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了多模态学习中的"顿悟时刻"，证明了通过统一框架可以实现理解与生成任务的双向协同提升，为统一多模态模型的发展提供了新范式。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAE或扩散方法无法充分建模人体运动的几何结构和物理约束，需要一种能够显式建模运动动力学并在底层关节几何空间上构建的严谨框架

Method: 在关节旋转、角速度和角加速度的乘积空间上构建神经距离场，提出自适应步长混合投影算法和几何积分器来生成合理运动轨迹

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的运动建模方法，为3D人体运动恢复提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案，能够很好地泛化到多种输入模态和任务

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Conclusion: 深度模型的局部性属性主要来自于数据本身的统计特性，而非网络结构的归纳偏差，这为理解和改进模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

ingests into a set of primitive operations, provide configuration through YAML

Conclusion: 简单的基于计数的嵌入方法可以作为复杂神经网络方法的有效替代方案，在保持性能的同时提供更好的计算效率和可解释性。

Abstract: To obtain insights from event data, advanced process mining methods assess
the similarity of activities to incorporate their semantic relations into the
analysis. Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from
activity co-occurrences is commonly employed. However, existing work for
distributional similarity in process mining adopt neural network-based
approaches as developed for natural language processing, e.g., word2vec and
autoencoders. While these approaches have been shown to be effective, their
downsides are high computational costs and limited interpretability of the
learned representations.
  In this work, we argue for simplicity in the modeling of distributional
similarity of activities. We introduce count-based embeddings that avoid a
complex training process and offer a direct interpretable representation. To
underpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive
benchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of
embeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their
computational efficiency. In experiments that compare against the state of the
art, we demonstrate that count-based embeddings provide a highly effective and
efficient basis for distributional similarity between activities in event data.

Conclusion: 该框架为关系数据库上的机器学习模型提供了有效的可解释性解决方案，能够以不同粒度级别生成有意义的解释。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

Abstract: Distributed systems require robust, scalable identifier schemes to ensure

presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of distributed identifiers,
comparing traditional auto-increment keys with UUIDv4, UUIDv7, and ULIDs. We

generation speed by 97.32%. statistical analysis further shows ULIDs offer a
98.42% lower collision risk compared to UUIDv7, while maintaining negligible
collision probabilities even at high generation rates. These findings highlight
ULIDs as an optimal choice for high-performance distributed systems, providing
efficient, time-ordered, and lexicographically sortable identifiers suitable

Abstract: Variant calling is the first step in analyzing a human genome and aims to
detect variants in an individual's genome compared to a reference genome. Due
to the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are
increasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and
storage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this
paper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling
pipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit
(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach
for optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our
approach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to
predict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline
based on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,
the second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by
drawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans
are executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We
evaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences
using a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our
approach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling
pipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,
percentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our
approach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also
used ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.
Finally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic
approach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without
using any ML-based time predictions.

Motivation: 随着多核系统扩展，缓存一致性成为系统性能关键因素。现有任务图建模方法要么依赖预定义图（不适用于动态应用），要么忽略一致性交互，导致设计假设与实际运行时行为存在差距。

Method: CoTAM框架通过三个步骤：1) 解耦缓存一致性影响与整体执行；2) 通过学习权重方案量化一致性影响；3) 推断任务间依赖关系以生成一致性感知的任务图。

Result: 大量实验表明，CoTAM优于隐式方法，能够弥合动态工作负载行为与现有设计之间的差距。

Conclusion: 将缓存一致性纳入任务图建模对于准确和可推广的系统级分析至关重要，CoTAM为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a
critical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task
execution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph
modeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as
the foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these
strategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world
applications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,
limiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task
graph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they
either rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features
without producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed
scheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often
overlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and
actual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a
Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that
constructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the
impact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,
quantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers
inter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive
experiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap
between dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the
importance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for
accurate and generalizable system-level analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的BRI-based CDC方案解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了更灵活、稳定和准确的分布式计算解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to enable low-capability edge nodes to cooperatively execute
computation-intensive tasks. However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)
significantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation
latency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is
widely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two
critical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result
unless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which
seriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in
their encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and
numerical instability in the computational results. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on
barycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several
outstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any
returned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both
finite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its
encoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances
approximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning. Fourthly, it
integrates a novel BRI-based gradient coding algorithm accelerating the
training process while providing robustness against stragglers. Finally,
experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is superior to existing
CDC schemes in both waiting time and approximate accuracy.

Motivation: 在非对称信任分布式系统中，可靠广播和共识等基础问题在仅满足一致性和可用性经典性质时无法解决。现有方案需要过于严格的假设，影响了非对称信任的优势。

Method: 提出了新的非对称问题形式化方法，并基于此设计了可靠广播和共识算法，这些算法需要比之前更弱的假设条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为非对称信任分布式系统提供了更实用的解决方案，在保持系统强治性的同时充分利用了参与者自由设置信任假设的灵活性。

Abstract: In distributed systems with asymmetric trust, each participant is free to
make its own trust assumptions about others, captured by an asymmetric quorum
system. This contrasts with ordinary, symmetric quorum systems and threshold
models, where trust assumptions are uniformly shared among participants.
Fundamental problems like reliable broadcast and consensus are unsolvable in
the asymmetric model if quorum systems satisfy only the classical properties of
consistency and availability. Existing approaches overcome this by introducing
stronger assumptions. We show that some of these assumptions are overly
restrictive, so much so that they effectively eliminate the benefits of
asymmetric trust. To address this, we propose a new approach to characterize
asymmetric problems and, building upon it, present algorithms for reliable
broadcast and consensus that require weaker assumptions than previous
solutions. Our methods are general and can be extended to other core problems
in systems with asymmetric trust.

Result: 评估显示TrEnv在容器环境中将P99延迟降低7倍，内存使用减少48%；在VM环境中P99延迟降低58%，内存节省61%，相比E2B等先进系统有显著提升。

Conclusion: TrEnv通过创新的环境重用技术有效解决了LLM代理在无服务器平台上的性能瓶颈，为高密度、低延迟的代理工作负载提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure
overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which
exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our
analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless
platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding
motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We
present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container-
and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents.
TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes
and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution
environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv
leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations
show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in
container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61%
memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like
E2B.

### [151] [Fingerprinting Deep Packet Inspection Devices by Their Ambiguities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09081)
*Diwen Xue,Armin Huremagic,Wayne Wang,Ram Sundara Raman,Roya Ensafi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫dMAP的远程测量框架，通过行为指纹识别和聚类深度包检查（DPI）设备，以应对网络干扰问题的严峙挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DPI设备的普及化，网络干扰（如审查、网速限制、抠抠）日益增多。但由于DPI位于网络中间节点且供应商主动隐藏，传统的主机扫描工具无法有效测量和理解这些设备。

Method: 基于差异模糊测试，dMAP系统地发现、选择和部署特殊探针，将DPI内部解析行为转换为可观测的外部指纹。该方法利用协议解释和实现选择中的歧义性来创建可测量的差异。

Result: 在全球范围内应用dMAP证明了其实际可行性。仅需要20-40个辨别性探针即可可靠地区分广泛的DPI实现，包括主要国家审查基础设施和商业DPI产品。

Conclusion: dMAP提供了一种有效的方法来远程识别和分类DPI设备，为网络干扰的主动镀审奠定了基础。该指纹技术不仅适用于审查，还可扩展到其他目标干扰形式。

Abstract: Users around the world face escalating network interference such as
censorship, throttling, and interception, largely driven by the commoditization
and growing availability of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices. Once reserved
for a few well-resourced nation-state actors, the ability to interfere with
traffic at scale is now within reach of nearly any network operator. Despite
this proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the
Internet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive
to conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring
their products further complicates measurement efforts.
  In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper),
that derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster
these otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward
active reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing
and interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves
ambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC
interpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices
that create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP
systematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that
translate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable
fingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its
practical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative
probes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including
major nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products. We
discuss how our fingerprinting methodology generalizes beyond censorship to
other forms of targeted interference.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques play a pivotal role in optimizing
wireless communication networks. However, traditional deep learning approaches
often act as closed boxes, lacking the structured reasoning abilities needed to
tackle complex, multi-step decision problems. This survey provides a
comprehensive review and outlook of reasoning-enabled AI in wireless
communication networks, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other
advanced reasoning paradigms. In particular, LLM-based agents can combine
reasoning with long-term planning, memory, tool utilization, and autonomous
cross-layer control to dynamically optimize network operations with minimal
human intervention. We begin by outlining the evolution of intelligent wireless
networking and the limitations of conventional AI methods. We then introduce
emerging AI reasoning techniques. Furthermore, we establish a classification
system applicable to wireless network tasks. We also present a layer-by-layer
examination for AI reasoning, covering the physical, data link, network,
transport, and application layers. For each part, we identify key challenges
and illustrate how AI reasoning methods can improve AI-based wireless
communication performance. Finally, we discuss key research directions for AI
reasoning toward future wireless communication networks. By combining insights
from both communications and AI, this survey aims to chart a path for
integrating reasoning techniques into the next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: 基于机器学习的O-RAN框架，通过多阈值策略同时优化负载均衡和能源效率，避免传统方法导致的负载不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI/ML方法主要通过载荷移除来实现能源效率，但这会导致网络负载不平衡，影响用户速率性能，需要同时解决负载均衡和能源效率优化的挑战

Method: 提出一个综合的ML框架，将问题形式化为多类分类系统，预测性评估潜在的RU配置，将网络条件映射到三个负载均衡类别（良好均衡、中等均衡、不均衡），采用多阈值策略来满足不同的运维优先级

Result: 使用426万个实际网络测量数据进行实验评估，随机森林模型达到了98.3%的F1-macro性能，比传统基准策略提高了195%

Conclusion: 该框架能够在O-RAN部署中有效地同时优化负载均衡和能源效率，通过多阈值策略满足不同运维需求，为网络能源管理提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture provides an intrinsic
capability to exploit key performance monitoring (KPM) within Radio
Intelligence Controller (RIC) to derive network optimisation through xApps.
These xApps can leverage KPM knowledge to dynamically switch on/off the
associated RUs where such a function is supported over the E2 interface.
Several existing studies employ artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning
(ML) based approaches to realise such dynamic sleeping for increased energy
efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, most of these approaches rely upon offloading
user equipment (UE) to carve out a sleeping opportunity. Such an approach
inherently creates load imbalance across the network. Such load imbalance may
impact the throughput performance of offloaded UEs as they might be allocated a
lower number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Maintaining the same PRB
allocation while addressing the EE at the network level is a challenging task.
To that end, in this article, we present a comprehensive ML-based framework for
joint optimisation of load balancing and EE for ORAN deployments. We formulate
the problem as a multi-class classification system that predictively evaluates
potential RU configurations before optimising the EE, mapping network
conditions to three load balance categories (Well Balanced, Moderately
Balanced, Imbalanced). Our multi-threshold approach (Conservative, Moderate,
Aggressive) accommodates different operational priorities between energy
savings and performance assurance. Experimental evaluation using 4.26 million
real network measurements from simulations demonstrates that our Random Forest
model achieves 98.3% F1-macro performance, representing 195% improvement over
traditional baseline strategies.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种集成软件定义网络(SDN)原理的量子密钥分配(QKD)网络架构，通过虚拟KMS(vKMS)和量子安全控制器(QuSeC)解决了KMS识别、中继路径发现和网络可扩展性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算对通信安全构成威胁，QKD网络虽能产生无条件安全密钥，但当前技术在可扩展性和长距离实现方面仍面临挑战。使用信任中继节点可部分解决距离问题，但中继路径确定仍缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 集成SDN原理，在每个节点中建立高层次虚拟KMS(vKMS)，并创建新实体量子安全控制器(QuSeC)。vKMS处理用户密钥请求，管理节点内多个KMS；QuSeC基于网络拓扑和状态的师视图，为vKMS提供路径发现服务，计算端到端中继路径并应用安全策略。

Result: 设计了能够解决QKD网络KMS识别、中继路径发现和可扩展性问题的网络架构。进行了安全分析，确定了架构的安全等级并分析了核心网络安全属性。

Conclusion: 通过SDN化方案集成vKMS和QuSeC实体，有效解决了QKD网络的关键技术挑战，为可行的量子安全通信网络提供了有力的架构支撑。

Abstract: With the advent of quantum computing, the increasing threats to security
poses a great challenge to communication networks. Recent innovations in this
field resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,
establishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD
networks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the
point-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current
state of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward
feasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,
trusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding
of the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD
link to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has
been extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still
lacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that
solves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path
discovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in
each node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller
(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs
within the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.
Additionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,
the QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the
end-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also
provides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels
of the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile security protocols and limited availability of
current datasets constrains research in app traffic analysis. This paper
presents PARROT, a reproducible and portable traffic capture system for
systematic app traffic collection using Android Virtual Devices. The system
provides automated environment setup, configurable Android versions, traffic
recording management, and labeled captures extraction with human-in-the-loop
app interaction. PARROT integrates mitmproxy for optional traffic decryption
with automated SSL/TLS key extraction, supporting flexible capture modes with
or without traffic interception. We collected a dataset of 80 apps selected
from the MAppGraph dataset list, providing traffic captures with corresponding
SSL keys for decryption analysis. Our comparative analysis between the
MAppGraph dataset (2021) and our dataset (2025) reveals app traffic pattern
evolution across 50 common apps. Key findings include migration from TLSv1.2 to
TLSv1.3 protocol, with TLSv1.3 comprising 90.0\% of TCP encrypted traffic in
2025 compared to 6.7\% in 2021. QUIC protocol adoption increased substantially,
with all 50 common apps generating QUIC traffic under normal network conditions
compared to 30 apps in 2021. DNS communications evolved from predominantly
unencrypted Do53 protocol (91.0\% in 2021) to encrypted DoT protocol (81.1\% in
2025). The open-source PARROT system enables reproducible app traffic capture
for research community adoption and provides insights into app security
protocol evolution.

Method: 利用Rocq定理证明器中的Verified LLVM框架，对基本块实现算术表达式$a * b + c$进行FMA融合乘加优化的正确性证明

Result: 成功证明了FMA优化在基本块中的正确性，为更复杂的浮点数优化验证奠定基础

floating-point optimizations, notably due to fast math, at the LLVM IR level.
We present a preliminary work, which leverages the Verified LLVM framework in
the Rocq theorem prover, to prove the correctness of Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA)
optimization for a basic block implementing the arithmetic expression $a * b +
c$ . We then propose ways to extend this preliminary results by adding more
program features and fast math floating-point optimizations.

TL;DR: 本文针对依赖类型语言在编译后类型规范被擦除的问题，提出通过类型保持编译来确保链接时的类型安全，防止外部程序违反原始程序规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 依赖类型语言如Coq、Agda等允许程序员编写详细规范并证明程序符合规范，但这些规范在编译后被擦除，导致链接外部程序时可能违反原始规范，即使使用验证编译器也无法避免。

Method: 开发支持依赖内存分配的中间语言，并构建依赖类型保持的编译器传递过程，通过类型保持编译确保类型信息在编译过程中得以保留，从而在链接时进行类型检查。

Result: 正在进行的工作，提出了支持依赖内存分配的中间语言设计，并开发了相应的类型保持编译器传递。

Conclusion: 通过类型保持编译方法可以在链接阶段进行类型检查，防止外部程序违反依赖类型程序的规范，提高编译后程序的安全性。

Abstract: Dependently typed programming languages such as Coq, Agda, Idris, and F*,
allow programmers to write detailed specifications of their programs and prove
their programs meet these specifications. However, these specifications can be
violated during compilation since they are erased after type checking. External
programs linked with the compiled program can violate the specifications of the
original program and change the behavior of the compiled program -- even when
compiled with a verified compiler. For example, since Coq does not allow
explicitly allocating memory, a programmer might link their Coq program with a
C program that can allocate memory. Even if the Coq program is compiled with a
verified compiler, the external C program can still violate the memory-safe
specification of the Coq program by providing an uninitialized pointer to
memory. This error could be ruled out by type checking in a language expressive
enough to indicate whether memory is initialized versus uninitialized. Linking
with a program with an uninitialized pointer could be considered ill-typed, and
our linking process could prevent linking with ill-typed programs. To
facilitate type checking during linking, we can use type-preserving
compilation, which preserves the types through the compilation process. In this
ongoing work, we develop a typed intermediate language that supports dependent
memory allocation, as well as a dependent-type-preserving compiler pass for
memory allocation.

Abstract: Pattern-based file access is a fundamental but often under-documented aspect
of computational research. The Python glob module provides a simple yet
powerful way to search, filter, and ingest files using wildcard patterns,
enabling scalable workflows across disciplines. This paper introduces glob as a
versatile tool for data science, business analytics, and artificial
intelligence applications. We demonstrate use cases including large-scale data
ingestion, organizational data analysis, AI dataset construction, and
reproducible research practices. Through concrete Python examples with widely
used libraries such as pandas,scikit-learn, and matplotlib, we show how glob
facilitates efficient file traversal and integration with analytical pipelines.
By situating glob within the broader context of reproducible research and data
engineering, we highlight its role as a methodological building block. Our goal
is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that
bridges foundational concepts and applied practice, making glob a default
citation for file pattern matching in Python-based research workflows.

Motivation: 解决LLM在GIS领域的专业限制，让普通用户能够通过自然语言完成空间数据处理任务。

Method: 采用三段式架构：任务解析、游客协作、结果集成。Planner游客转换自然语言为GeoJSON命令，Worker游客通过函数调用或代码生成处理空间数据。

Result: 在70个任务的测试中，函数调用方法准确率85.71%，代码生成方法达到97.14%，都显著超过通用模型(48.57%)。代码生成更灵活，函数调用更稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将多游客LLM框架应用于GeoJSON数据，为提升GeoAI系统性能提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language
understanding.However,without expertise in GIS,they continue to encounter
limitations.To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent
LLM architecture.This framework transforms natural language tasks into
structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two
widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques:Function Calling and Code
Generation.The architecture consists of three components-task parsing,agent
collaboration,and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance
and scalability of GIS automation.The Planner agent interprets natural language
tasks into structured GeoJSON commands.Then,specialized Worker agents
collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and
analysis,either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically
generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code.Finally,the system
integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into
reusable,standards-compliant GeoJSON files.To systematically evaluate the
performance of the two approaches,we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70
tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o
as the core model.Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON
Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%,while the Code Generation-based agent
reached 97.14%,both significantly outperforming the best-performing
general-purpose model (48.57%).Further analysis reveals that the Code
Generation provides greater flexibility,whereas the Function Calling approach
offers more stable execution.This study is the first to introduce an LLM
multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and
limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods,offering new perspectives
for improving GeoAI system performance.

Motivation: 传统分析技术难以恢复深度隐藏的恶意行为或提供人类可读的决策解释，需要更强大的分析框架来应对复杂的Android恶意软件规避策略

Method: 首先生成方法级代码片段的摘要并索引到向量数据库，然后通过行为导向的问题检索语义相关的代码片段进行深度检查，最后基于多轮分析生成包含恶意行为及其代码实现的人类可读报告

Result: 实验结果显示达到96%的恶意软件检测准确率和83.81%的行为识别准确率，专家评估确认生成报告的实际效用

Conclusion: TraceRAG框架成功地将自然语言处理与代码分析相结合，为Android恶意软件检测提供了可解释且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Sophisticated evasion tactics in malicious Android applications, combined
with their intricate behavioral semantics, enable attackers to conceal
malicious logic within legitimate functions, underscoring the critical need for
robust and in-depth analysis frameworks. However, traditional analysis
techniques often fail to recover deeply hidden behaviors or provide
human-readable justifications for their decisions. Inspired by advances in
large language models (LLMs), we introduce TraceRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that bridges natural language queries and Java code
to deliver explainable malware detection and analysis. First, TraceRAG
generates summaries of method-level code snippets, which are indexed in a
vector database. At query time, behavior-focused questions retrieve the most
semantically relevant snippets for deeper inspection. Finally, based on the
multi-turn analysis results, TraceRAG produces human-readable reports that
present the identified malicious behaviors and their corresponding code
implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 96\%
malware detection accuracy and 83.81\% behavior identification accuracy based
on updated VirusTotal (VT) scans and manual verification. Furthermore, expert
evaluation confirms the practical utility of the reports generated by TraceRAG.

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更可持续的AI系统提供了重要的能源效率评估工具和涉及因素分析。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing
valuable insights for developers aiming to build more sustainable AI systems.

Abstract: Code comprehension and analysis of open-source project codebases is a task

To address this, we present CLARA, a browser extension that utilizes a

code quality attribute detection. We qualitatively evaluated CLARA's inference
model using existing datasets and methodology, and performed a comprehensive

### [164] [Probing Pre-trained Language Models on Code Changes: Insights from ReDef, a High-Confidence Just-in-Time Defect Prediction Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09192)
*Doha Nam,Taehyoun Kim,Duksan Ryu,Jongmoon Baik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ReDef数据集，通过revert commits和GPT辅助筛选构建了高信度的软件缺陷预测数据集，并系统评估了预训练语言模型在代码修改理解方面的能力和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有JIT-SDP数据集标签噪声大、精确度低的问题，并探索预训练语言模型是否真正理解代码修改语义。

Method: 通过revert commits标记缺陷修改，历史检查验证清洁修改，GPT辅助多次投票审核筛选模糊实例，构建ReDef数据集。对CodeBERT、CodeT5+、UniXcoder进行微调，使用5种编码策略，并通过受影实验探测模型敏感性。

Result: 构建了3,164个缺陷修改和10,268个清洁修改的高信度数据集。紧凑差分式编码在所有PLM中都超过整体函数格式，但反事实干扰测试显示模型依赖表面线索而非真正语义理解。

Conclusion: 当前预训练语言模型在代码修改理解方面存在局限性，虽然表面上显示出稳健性，但实际上依赖表面线索，无法真正理解代码修改的语义。

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

### [165] [On Integrating Large Language Models and Scenario-Based Programming for Improving Software Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09194)
*Ayelet Berzack,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合大语言模型(LLMs)与传统软件工程技术的方法论，通过场景基于编程(SBP)范式来提高LLM在软件开发中的可靠性和可验证性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在软件开发中虽然有明显优势，但经常会引入重大错误并以说服力强的信心呈现错误代码，需要更可靠的方法来结合LLMs与传统软件工程技术

Method: 采用场景基于编程(SBP)范式，这是一种事件驱动的、基于场景的软件工程方法，允许开发人员将专业知识流入LLM，并检查和验证其输出

Result: 通过连接四游戏的重要案例研究，创建了能够战胜各种强大玩家的高效能组件，并在某些情况下能够形式验证组件的正确性

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与SBP的方法论能够在保持开发效率的同时提高代码质量和可靠性，为LLMs在软件开发周期中的更可靠集成提供了有效途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the
correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights
regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our
case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this
paper.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 首次大规模研究Git历史修改问题，在111M仓库中发玱1.22M仓库存在8.7M个重写历史，开发了GitHistorian工具来检测历史修改


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查公共Git仓库中的历史修改行为，识别这些修改对下游用户、仓库完整性和可复现性的威胁，以及供应链攻击风险

Method: 分析软件遗产库Software Heritage录入的111M个仓库，识别和分类历史修改行为，进行两个目标案例研究（许可证和密钥删除）

Result: 发玱1.22M仓库存在8.7M个重写历史，识别出逆向修改许可证和删除敏感信息的常见情况，开发了GitHistorian自动化检测工具

Conclusion: 公共Git仓库中的历史修改是普遍现象，可能导致项目管理和安全风险，需要工具来识别和监控这些修改行为

Abstract: Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git allow developers to locally rewrite
recorded history, e.g., to reorder and suppress commits or specific data in
them. These alterations have legitimate use cases, but become problematic when
performed on public branches that have downstream users: they break push/pull
workflows, challenge the integrity and reproducibility of repositories, and
create opportunities for supply chain attackers to sneak into them nefarious
changes. We conduct the first large-scale investigation of Git history
alterations in public code repositories. We analyze 111 M (millions)
repositories archived by Software Heritage, which preserves VCS histories even
across alterations. We find history alterations in 1.22 M repositories, for a
total of 8.7 M rewritten histories. We categorize changes by where they happen
(which repositories, which branches) and what is changed in them (files or
commit metadata). Conducting two targeted case studies we show that altered
histories recurrently change licenses retroactively, or are used to remove
''secrets'' (e.g., private keys) committed by mistake. As these behaviors
correspond to bad practices-in terms of project governance or security
management, respectively-that software recipients might want to avoid, we
introduce GitHistorian, an automated tool, that developers can use to spot and
describe history alterations in public Git repositories.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了CodeBERT在产业环境中检测漏洞的性能，开发了AI-DO推荐系统，并通过调查评估其实用性。结果显示产业数据训练的模型在同域效果好，而经过适当处理的开源数据训练模型能提高检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习漏洞检测技术在学术界发展迅速，但在产业环境中应用遇到了信任性、系统集成、工作流程等挑战。需要研究如何将这些技术从学术转移到产业实践中。

Method: 首先评估CodeBERT在产业和开源软件中检测漏洞函数的性能，分析跨域汇总能力，探索类不平衡处理策略。然后开发AI-DO推荐系统，集成到CI/CD流程中，在代码审查时检测和定位漏洞。最后通过调查评估工具的实用性。

Result: 结果显示：使用产业数据训练的模型在同一域内能准确检测漏洞，但在开源代码上性能下降。而使用适当下采样技术处理的开源数据细调的深度学习器，能够提高漏洞检测能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适当的数据处理策略和系统集成，深度学习漏洞检测技术可以有效地应用于产业环境，为开发者提供不打断工作流的漏洞检测解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning solutions for vulnerability detection proposed in academic
research are not always accessible to developers, and their applicability in
industrial settings is rarely addressed. Transferring such technologies from
academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy
systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial
expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into
existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the
performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and
open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when
fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa,
also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results,
we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers'
Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated
recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise
vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we
assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT
professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect
vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on
open-source code, while a deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with
appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of
vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究容器安全分析工具在遇到隐藏/不完整容器时的限制，提出了一种具有遮蔽弹性的新方法ORCA，并证明其在文件覆盖率方面较现有工具有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发依赖开源库和第三方组件，容器化环境带来安全风险。软件组成分析(SCA)工具在遇到隐藏/不完整容器时存在分析偏差，影响安全检测的可靠性。

Method: 分析了600个流行容器，研究现有SCA工具的限制，提出了一种具有遮蔽弹性的容器分析方法ORCA(Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer)，并开源实现。

Result: 发现隐藏容器在知名注册表和可信图像中常见，许多工具无法分析此类容器。ORCA能有效检测隐藏容器内容，与Docker Scout和Syft相比文件覆盖率提升了中位数40%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的ORCA方法能够有效解决现有SCA工具在分析隐藏容器时的限制，显著提高了容器安全分析的可靠性和效果。

Abstract: Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and
third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized
environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications,
this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or
vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments.
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify
and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional
modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container
images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we
examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when
faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed
that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and
that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we
propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and
introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source
implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate
channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of
obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage
compared to Docker Scout and Syft.

TL;DR: LoCoBench是一个专门评估长上下文LLM在复杂软件开发场景中能力的基准测试，包含8000个评估场景、10种编程语言、10K到1M tokens的上下文长度范围，以及8个任务类别和17个评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着支持百万token上下文窗口的语言模型出现，需要专门的基准测试来评估这些模型在真实复杂软件开发场景中的长上下文理解能力，填补现有代码评估基准在长上下文能力评估方面的空白。

Method: 通过5阶段流水线系统生成多样化的高质量评估场景，涵盖10种编程语言，上下文长度从10K到1M tokens，包含8个任务类别：架构理解、跨文件重构、多会话开发、bug调查、功能实现、代码理解、集成测试和安全分析。

Result: 对最先进的长上下文模型评估显示存在显著的性能差距，表明复杂软件开发中的长上下文理解仍然是一个重大未解决的挑战。

Conclusion: LoCoBench揭示了长上下文模型在复杂软件开发场景中的局限性，强调了这一领域需要更多关注和研究，为未来模型开发提供了重要的评估基准。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial
performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex
software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands
more attention. LoCoBench is released at:

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SmartDetector是一个用于检测智能合约函数相似性的新方法，通过将AST分解为语句树并进行细粒度比较，在F1分数上平均提升14.01%，达到95.88%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约开发中广泛重用开源代码导致bug传播加剧，而现有的AST方法和深度学习方法分别面临处理复杂树结构困难以及忽略代码语法和可解释性的问题。

Method: 将智能合约函数的AST分解为一系列语句树，使用分类器比较语句树对来计算相似度得分，并通过余弦扩散过程高效搜索最优超参数。

Result: 在三个大型真实数据集上的实验表明，SmartDetector在F1分数上平均提升14.01%，总体平均F1分数达到95.88%，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SmartDetector通过细粒度语句级比较和高效的超参数搜索，有效解决了智能合约函数相似性检测的挑战，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Widespread reuse of open-source code in smart contract development boosts
programming efficiency but significantly amplifies bug propagation across
contracts, while dedicated methods for detecting similar smart contract
functions remain very limited. Conventional abstract-syntax-tree (AST) based
methods for smart contract similarity detection face challenges in handling
intricate tree structures, which impedes detailed semantic comparison of code.
Recent deep-learning based approaches tend to overlook code syntax and
detection interpretability, resulting in suboptimal performance.
  To fill this research gap, we introduce SmartDetector, a novel approach for
computing similarity between smart contract functions, explainable at the
fine-grained statement level. Technically, SmartDetector decomposes the AST of
a smart contract function into a series of smaller statement trees, each
reflecting a structural element of the source code. Then, SmartDetector uses a
classifier to compute the similarity score of two functions by comparing each
pair of their statement trees. To address the infinite hyperparameter space of
the classifier, we mathematically derive a cosine-wise diffusion process to
efficiently search optimal hyperparameters. Extensive experiments conducted on
three large real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartDetector outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods by an average improvement of 14.01% in
F1-score, achieving an overall average F1-score of 95.88%.

TL;DR: 使用贝叶斯VAR模型分析不同排放情景下的温度预测，发现高排放情景下条件预测与无条件预测路径相似，而低排放情景下2040年后条件预测温度会低于无条件预测，但政策效果存在显著滞后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过贝叶斯VAR框架，结合气候驱动因素的等式和不等式约束，生成直到2050年的条件温度预测，分析不同排放情景对全球变暖的影响。

Method: 采用Chan等人(2025)提出的贝叶斯VAR框架，利用碳排放和甲烷排放等气候驱动因素的等式和不等式约束，进行反事实情景分析，包括"一切照旧"高排放情景和高度减排低排放情景。

Result: 高排放情景下条件预测与无条件预测路径相似；低排放情景下2040年后条件预测温度低于无条件轨迹，表明减排可以显著减缓升温，但排放变化的影响存在很大滞后性。

Conclusion: 气候变化应对政策设计时需要充分考虑排放变化影响的显著滞后效应，及时采取减排措施才能有效减缓全球变暖。

Abstract: In this paper, using the Bayesian VAR framework suggested by Chan et al.
(2025), we produce conditional temperature forecasts up until 2050, by
exploiting both equality and inequality constraints on climate drivers like
carbon dioxide or methane emissions. Engaging in a counterfactual scenario
analysis by imposing a Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenario of
"business as-usual", with no mitigation and high emissions, we observe that
conditional and unconditional forecasts would follow a similar path. Instead,
if a high mitigation with low emissions scenario were to be followed, the
conditional temperature paths would remain below the unconditional trajectory
after 2040, i.e. temperatures increases can potentially slow down in a
meaningful way, but the lags for changes in emissions to have an effect are
quite substantial. The latter should be taken into account greatly when
designing response policies to climate change.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含兼容性摩擦的供应链形成新理论，分析了专业化选择、生产复杂性和搜索摩擦如何共同决定供应链弹性，发现均衡状态下存在过度专业化问题，导致供应链在正常时期更高效但抗干扰能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管政策关注度不断提高，但供应链弹性的决定因素仍未得到充分理解。现有研究缺乏对供应链形成机制和弹性决定因素的系统理论分析。

Method: 建立包含兼容性摩擦的供应链形成理论模型，中间产品生产者选择专业化程度，在更高生产率和更少兼容最终生产者之间权衡。将供应链建模为需要采购多种互补投入品的复杂生产过程。

Result: 相对于有效配置，均衡状态存在过度专业化问题，这是由于摩擦市场、内生专业化和复杂生产相互作用产生的新型网络外部性所致。过度专业化使供应链在正常时期更高效但抗干扰能力不足。

Conclusion: 有针对性的交易补贴可以实现供应链的有效弹性配置，兼容性标准的设定对供应链弹性有重要影响。该理论为理解供应链弹性和制定相关政策提供了新的分析框架。

Abstract: Despite growing policy interest, the determinants of supply chain resilience
are still not well understood. We propose a new theory of supply chain
formation with compatibility frictions: only compatible inputs can be used in
final good production. Intermediate producers choose the degree of
specialization of their goods, trading off higher productivity against a lower
share of compatible final producers. We model supply chains as complex
production processes in which multiple complementary inputs must be sourced for
final production to take place. Specialization choices, production complexity,
and search frictions jointly determine supply chain resilience. Relative to the
efficient allocation, the equilibrium is characterized by over-specialization
due to a novel network externality arising from the interplay between
frictional markets, endogenous specialization, and complex production.
Over-specialization makes supply chains more productive in normal times but
less resilient to disruptions than socially desirable. We show how a targeted
transaction subsidy can decentralize efficient resilience in supply chains, and
examine the implications of setting compatibility standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病不断增多，对全球减贫、促进健康公平和控制医疗费用构成挑战。需要了解患者如何在住院和门诊服务之间做出选择，尤其是较为輪困的群体是否有不同的选择模式。

Method: 采用结构化方法，利用中国农村县城的健康保险申赔数据，分析患者在住院和门诊服务之间的选择交易，并评估反贫困程序对住院费用共享的影响。

Result: 较为輪困的个体偏向避免使用门诊服务，除非其能大幅降住医疗费用；而普通群体更偏向于选择门诊服务以防止疾病进展。反贫困保险政策使门诊使用率减少23%，医疗费用增加，患者福利下降46.2%。

Conclusion: 目前以住院为主的反贫困政策存在不良影响，建议改革政策重点，通过降住门诊服务的自费共享来提高健康效果和支持较为輪困的群体，这比提供旅行补贴更为成本效益。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases poses a significant challenge
to global efforts to alleviate poverty, promote health equity, and control
healthcare costs. This study adopts a structural approach to explore how
patients manage chronic diseases by making trade-offs between inpatient care
and ambulatory care outpatient services. Specifically, it investigates whether
disadvantaged populations make distinct trade-offs compared to the general
population and examines the impact of anti-poverty programs that reduce
inpatient cost-sharing.
  Using health insurance claims data from a rural county in China, the study
reveals that disadvantaged individuals tend to avoid ambulatory care unless it
substantially lowers medical expenses. In contrast, the general population is
more likely to prioritize ambulatory care, even at higher costs, to prevent
disease progression. The findings also indicate that current anti-poverty
insurance policies, which focus predominantly on hospitalization, inadvertently
decrease ambulatory care usage by 23\%, resulting in increased healthcare costs
and a 46.2\% decline in patient welfare. Counterfactual analysis suggests that
reducing cost-sharing for ambulatory care would be a more cost-effective
strategy for improving health outcomes and supporting disadvantaged populations
than providing travel subsidies.

Conclusion: 文化传承在形成环境意识中起关键作用，人们学习环境既为优化利用普通条件，也为防范极端事件，这双重目标导致了U形关系

Abstract: How does the climatic experience of previous generations affect today's
attention to environmental questions? Using self-reported beliefs and
environmental themes in folklore, we show empirically that the realized
intensity of deviations from typical climate conditions in ancestral
generations influences how much descendants care about the environment. The
effect exhibits a U-shape where more stable and more unstable ancestral
climates lead to higher attention today, with a dip for intermediate
realizations. We propose a theoretical framework where the value of costly
attention to environmental conditions depends on the perceived stability of the
environment, prior beliefs about which are shaped through cultural transmission
by the experience of ethnic ancestors. The U-shape is rationalized by a double
purpose of learning about the environment: optimal utilization of typical
conditions and protection against extreme events.

Motivation: 研究非凸偏好下的最优风险分担问题，探索多代理性如何自然产生凸性，从而克服传统凸优化方法对偏好凸性的依赖。

Method: 使用非原子测度空间建模连续代理，基于Lyapunov凸性原理证明有限维情况下的聚合凸性，通过近似论证扩展到无限维情况，特别针对一类定律不变风险度量。

Result: 证明了多代理性诱导价值函数凸性，允许在无偏好凸性假设下应用凸对偶技术，并获得了价值函数的显式对偶表示和计算可行的共轭函数公式。

Conclusion: 多代理性本身能够产生凸性，使得凸对偶技术可以应用于非凸偏好的风险分担问题，为这类问题的分析和计算提供了新的理论框架和方法。

Abstract: We consider the optimal risk sharing problem with a continuum of agents,
modeled via a non-atomic measure space. Individual preferences are not assumed
to be convex. We show the multiplicity of agents induces the value function to
be convex, allowing for the application of convex duality techniques to risk
sharing without preference convexity. The proof in the finite-dimensional case
is based on aggregate convexity principles emanating from Lyapunov convexity,
while the infinite-dimensional case uses the finite-dimensional results
conjoined with approximation arguments particular to a class of law invariant
risk measures, although the reference measure is allowed to vary between
agents. Finally, we derive a computationally tractable formula for the
conjugate of the value function, yielding an explicit dual representation of
the value function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在借款人可以建立诚实声誉的情况下，实物抵押品如何影响战略违约行为，以及抵押贷款与无抵押贷款之间的互补关系。

Method: 构建有限期模型，分析借款人在拥有资产情况下的借贷决策，考察抵押品对声誉建立和违约决策的影响机制。

Result: 资产所有权使声誉渠道更具吸引力；抵押品促进声誉建立，在资产价格下跌时效果最佳；当借款人财务收入与非财务收入比率适中时，有抵押和无抵押贷款的互补性最强。

Conclusion: 实物抵押品在战略违约环境中通过促进声誉建立发挥重要作用，特别是在资产价格波动时期，抵押贷款与无抵押贷款之间存在显著的互补关系。

Abstract: This paper builds a finite-horizon model to study the role of physical
collateral in a model of strategic defaults, when the borrower can develop
reputation for honesty. Asset ownership increases attractiveness of the
reputational channel: the borrower who would prefer to remain in autarky in the
absence of the asset prefers to apply for collateralized debt. Pledging the
asset as collateral facilitates reputation building, which is especially
successful at the times of asset price drops, because these are the times when
default is most tempting. The complementarity between secured and unsecured
lending is especially pronounced when the ratio of the borrower's financial to
non-financial income is neither too large nor too small.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发送者与多个接收者之间的策略性沟通问题，特别是当接收者的收益依赖于发送者信息时产生的聚合收益外部性效应

Method: 建立理论模型分析发送者与接收者群体之间的策略性沟通，考察聚合收益外部性对信息传递的影响

Result: 聚合收益外部性在发送者与接收者之间创造了内生的利益冲突，使得完全信息披露通常不可行；但发送者偏好中的外生偏见反而可以改善公共信息提供并提高整体福利

Conclusion: 在具有聚合收益外部性的策略性沟通环境中，适度的发送者偏见可能对公共信息提供和社会福利产生积极影响

Abstract: This paper develops a model in which a sender strategically communicates with
a group of receivers whose payoffs depend on the sender's information. It is
shown that aggregate payoff externalities create an endogenous conflict of
interests between the sender and the receivers, rendering full information
revelation, in general infeasible. We demonstrate that an exogenous bias in the
sender's preferences can improve public information provision and raise
welfare. Two applications of the setup are discussed.

TL;DR: 研究带信念多样性的囚徒困境博弈，分析信任水平对合作的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在玩家对伙伴诚实性有明确信念的环境中，相比完全不确定伙伴信念的情况，是否更有利于合作

Method: 建立两玩家博弈模型，引入'诚实'类型玩家和道德成本，分析不同信任水平下的合作行为

Result: 信念多样性在信任水平较低的环境中阻碍合作，在信任水平较高的环境中促进合作

Conclusion: 环境中的信任水平是决定信念多样性对合作影响的关键因素

Abstract: This paper studies a two-player game in which the players face uncertainty
regarding the nature of their partner. In this variation of the standard
Prisoner's Dilemma, players may encounter an 'honest' type who always
cooperates. Mistreating such a player imposes a moral cost on the defector.
This situation creates a trade-off, resolved in favor of cooperation if the
player's trust level, or belief in their partner's honesty, is sufficiently
high. We investigate whether an environment where players have explicit beliefs
about each other's honesty is more or less conducive to cooperation, compared
to a scenario where players are entirely uncertain about their partner's
beliefs. We establish that belief diversity hampers cooperation in environments
where the level of trust is relatively low and boosts cooperation in
environments with a high level of trust.

### [179] [The value of conceptual knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09170)
*Benjamin Davies,Anirudh Sankar*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文形式化了统计决策环境中概念知识的含义，探讨了概念知识如何通过特征组合表示状态，以及其在数据量和质量变化时的价值变化规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究统计决策环境中概念知识的价值，理解知识如何帮助智能体通过特征组合来表示状态，以及这种知识在不同数据条件下的价值变化。

Method: 通过形式化定义概念知识，分析状态的可约性（reducibility）特征，研究知识价值与数据量、数据质量之间的非单调关系。

Result: 概念知识在状态高度可约时价值更大；其价值随数据量和质量呈非单调变化，在无限数据时价值消失；拥有更深知识的智能体可以用更少数据达到相同福利水平。

Conclusion: 概念知识在统计决策中具有重要价值，特别是在状态高度可约的情况下，能够显著提高数据使用效率，但其价值随数据可获得性而变化。

Abstract: We formalize what it means to have conceptual knowledge about a statistical
decision-making environment. Such knowledge tells agents about the structural
relationships among unknown, payoff-relevant states. It allows agents to
represent states as combinations of features. Conceptual knowledge is more
valuable when states are more "reducible": when their prior variances are
explained by fewer features. Its value is non-monotone in the quantity and
quality of available data, and vanishes with infinite data. Agents with deeper
knowledge can attain the same welfare with less data. This is especially true
when states are highly reducible.

*Jacopo Bizzotto,Nathan Hancart*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 研究使用分数进行廉价对话时，由于语言简化带来的战略考量，发现均衡收益低于承诺评分规则，且均衡分数必须是线性或离散的


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在多维状态下使用简单语言（分数）进行沟通时，发送者和接收者共享相同二次损失函数收益的情况下的战略互动

Method: 分析廉价对话模型，研究分数限制对均衡的影响，证明均衡分数的数学特性（线性或离散），并在正态分布假设下完全刻画线性分数均衡集

Result: 1) 均衡收益严格低于承诺评分规则下的收益 2) 任何均衡分数必须是线性或离散的 3) 在正态分布状态下完全描述了包含最优和最差线性分数的均衡线性分数集合

Conclusion: 即使发送者和接收者利益一致，简单语言（分数）的限制也会引入战略考虑，影响沟通效率和均衡结果

Abstract: We study cheap talk with simple language, where the sender communicates using
a score that aggregates a multidimensional state. Both the sender and the
receiver share the same payoffs, given by a quadratic loss function. We show
that the restriction to scores introduces strategic considerations. First,
equilibrium payoffs can be strictly lower than those achievable under
commitment to a scoring rule. Second, we prove that any equilibrium score must
be either linear or discrete. Finally, assuming normally distributed states, we
fully characterize the set of equilibrium linear scores, which includes both
the ex-ante best and the worst linear scores.

### [181] [Heterogeneous Agents in the Data Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09656)
*Yongheng Hu*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文定义了数据投资者的投资能力及其异质性，构建了异质代理人模型，证明投资能力差异导致经济结果分化，高能力投资者能获得更大效用和更强投资激励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展数据经济的分析框架，从当前普遍的代表性代理人模型转向异质代理人模型，为数据经济提供更准确的理论基础。

Method: 构建分析性异质代理人模型，研究数据投资能力的异质性及其对经济结果的影响。

Result: 投资能力高的数据投资者能通过数据投资获得更大效用，有更强激励进行大规模数据投资，从而实现更高生产率、技术进步和更低金融摩擦。

Conclusion: 数据投资能力的异质性是影响数据投资者经济表现的关键因素，需要采用异质代理人模型来更准确地分析数据经济。

Abstract: In this short paper, we define the investment ability of data investors in
the data economy and its heterogeneity. We further construct an analytical
heterogeneous agent model to demonstrate that differences in data investment
ability lead to divergent economic results for data investors. The analytical
results prove that: Investors with higher data investment ability can obtain
greater utility through data investment, and thus have stronger incentives to
invest in a larger scale of data to achieve higher productivity, technological
progress, and experience lower financial frictions. We aim to propose a
prerequisite theory that extends the analytical framework of the data economy
from the currently prevalent representative agent model to a heterogeneous
agent model.

### [2] [TableReasoner: Advancing Table Reasoning Framework with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08046)
*Sishi Xiong,Dakai Wang,Yu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Changzai Pan,Haowei He,Xiangyu Li,Wenhan Chang,Zhongjiang He,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型和编程的表格推理框架TableReasoner，用于解决表格问答任务中的挑战，如数据量大、列语义不完整和实体歧义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格问答任务面临真实世界表格数据的挑战，如数据量大、列语义不完整和实体歧义，需要一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Method: 提出TableReasoner框架，结合结构和语义表示建模表格，设计多步模式链接计划以聚焦查询相关信息，并集成迭代思考架构。

Result: 系统在SemEval-2025 Task 8的两个子任务中均获得第一名。

Conclusion: TableReasoner通过结合大语言模型和编程方法，有效解决了表格问答任务中的挑战，并取得了显著成果。

Abstract: The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA).
TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular
data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To
address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and
programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a
table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations,
enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table
details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the
reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing
incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves
first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

### [3] [A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)
*Zhengye Han,Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态Stackelberg博弈框架，用于建模大语言模型（LLM）越狱攻击中攻击者与防御者的交互，并提出了名为“紫色代理”的AI解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键应用中的部署增加，越狱攻击（绕过安全机制）成为重要问题，需要有效防御方法。

Method: 采用Stackelberg博弈框架，将提示-响应动态建模为序贯扩展形式博弈，提出结合对抗探索和防御策略的“紫色代理”AI解决方案，使用RRT技术模拟攻击轨迹并主动干预。

Result: 该方法为分析对抗动态提供了原则性方法，并为降低越狱风险奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 动态博弈框架和紫色代理为LLM安全防御提供了新思路，有望有效应对越狱攻击。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

### [4] [Reasoning and Behavioral Equilibria in LLM-Nash Games: From Mindsets to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08208)
*Quanyan Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Nash框架通过游戏理论模型研究LLM驱动的决策，关注有限理性下的推理均衡，与传统纳什均衡不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在有限理性下的决策行为，探索推理过程对战略交互的影响。

Method: 基于游戏理论，定义提示空间上的均衡，通过LLM推理生成行为输出。

Result: 推理均衡与传统纳什均衡存在差异，为LLM系统战略交互提供新视角。

Conclusion: LLM-Nash框架为有限理性下的战略交互提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

### [5] [From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)
*Fryderyk Mantiuk,Hanqi Zhou,Charley M. Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了智能体如何在探索（好奇心）与控制（能力）之间取得平衡，通过对比两种模型驱动的智能体（Tabular和Dreamer），揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体如何平衡好奇心（追求知识）与能力（控制环境）的动机，以理解探索与控制的动态关系。

Method: 比较了两种模型驱动的智能体：Tabular（手工设计状态抽象）和Dreamer（学习内部世界模型），分析其探索行为。

Result: Tabular智能体显示好奇心和能力引导探索的不同模式，而Dreamer智能体揭示了探索与表征学习的双向互动。

Conclusion: 研究形式化了适应性探索为追求未知与可控之间的平衡，为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

### [6] [Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)
*Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros,Francesco Giannini,Marco Gori,Giuseppe Marra,Michelangelo Diligenti*

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有神经符号方法在逻辑接地时面临组合爆炸或启发式方法缺乏理论保证的问题，需要一种更灵活且可控的方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于多跳符号推理的参数化接地方法，扩展了经典的后向链式推理，允许在表达力和可扩展性之间权衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，接地标准的选择对神经符号方法的性能具有重要影响。

Conclusion: 参数化接地方法为神经符号推理提供了灵活性和可控性，平衡了表达力和计算效率。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

### [7] [Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)
*Atit Pokharel,Ratun Rahman,Thomas Morris,Dinh C. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对量子联邦学习（QFL）的多模态方法，并引入缺失模态无关（MMA）机制以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QFL框架主要针对单模态系统，难以应对现实任务中的多模态需求，且缺失模态会影响模型性能。

Method: 采用中间融合的量子纠缠方法，并设计MMA机制隔离未训练的量子电路。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态QFL结合MMA机制显著提升了模型性能，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 分析了加密货币和智能合约的独特属性，并详细描述了可能的新型危害向量。

Result: 识别了新型AI危害向量，强调了预防和减轻这些危害的必要性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in giving AI agents access to cryptocurrencies as
well as to the smart contracts that transact them. But doing so, this position
paper argues, could lead to formidable new vectors of AI harm. To support this

more technical research aimed at preventing and mitigating these harms and,
thereby making it safer to endow AI agents with cryptocurrencies and smart
contracts.

### [9] [Abductive Computational Systems: Creative Abduction and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08264)
*Abhinav Sood,Kazjon Grace,Stephen Wan,Cecile Paris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了溯因推理在认识论、科学和设计中的讨论，分析了计算系统如何应用溯因推理，发现理论和计算实现均未能有效支持创造性假设的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨溯因推理在不同领域的理解差异，并分析计算系统在创造性假设生成方面的不足。

Method: 综述文献并分析计算系统的溯因推理实现，分解其组成部分。

Result: 理论和计算实现均未能有效支持创造性假设的生成。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以推动计算系统中创造性溯因推理的发展。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations,
is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its
understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive
reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses
how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows
that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of
abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses.
Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating
creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement
syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational
systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for
future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in
computational systems.

### [10] [Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270)
*Zeyang Sha,Hanling Tian,Zhuoer Xu,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng,Weiqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的安全对齐框架，用于处理使用工具的LLM代理的安全风险，包括用户和工具引发的威胁，并通过结构化推理和沙盒强化学习优化安全性与实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着能够使用工具的自主LLM代理的出现，传统对话滥用之外的安全风险增加，需要一种统一的方法来应对用户和工具两方面的威胁。

Method: 提出了一个三模态分类法（良性、恶意、敏感）和策略驱动的决策模型，并设计了一个沙盒环境进行细粒度奖励塑造。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，安全对齐的代理显著提高了对安全威胁的抵抗能力，同时保持了良性任务的高效性。

Conclusion: 安全性与有效性可以共同优化，为自主LLM代理的可信部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2-Reasoning-7B模型通过创新的数据管道和动态多任务训练策略，提升了多模态大语言模型在动态空间交互中的推理能力，并在多个基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在动态空间交互能力上存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1. 构建高质量数据管道（294.2K样本）；2. 动态多任务训练策略与任务特定奖励。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中达到新SOTA，尤其在空间推理领域表现突出。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

### [12] [Multi-Agent LLMs as Ethics Advocates in AI-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08392)
*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体LLM的框架，通过伦理倡导代理自动生成伦理需求草案，以解决人工需求获取中的资源限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于时间和资源限制，人工获取伦理需求效率低且优先级低，需要自动化工具辅助。

Method: 在多智能体LLM中引入伦理倡导代理，根据系统描述提出伦理问题并生成需求草案。

Result: 通过两个案例研究验证，框架能捕捉大部分人工访谈识别的伦理需求，并补充新需求，但存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于推广伦理需求工程，但需结合人工反馈以确保可靠性。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Abstract: We define several canonical problems related to contrastive explanations,
each answering a question of the form ''Why P but not Q?''. The problems
compute causes for both P and Q, explicitly comparing their differences. We
investigate the basic properties of our definitions in the setting of
propositional logic. We show, inter alia, that our framework captures a
cardinality-minimal version of existing contrastive explanations in the
literature. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the computational
complexities of the problems. We also implement the problems for CNF-formulas
using answer set programming and present several examples demonstrating how
they work in practice.

### [14] [From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501)
*Keying Yang,Hao Wang,Kai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层框架，通过任务抽象和逻辑生成两阶段将自然语言映射为逻辑表示，显著提升了推理准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言输入与形式逻辑表示之间的鸿沟，实现更准确、可解释的推理。

Method: 采用双层框架：高层任务抽象（LLM解析为结构化表示）和低层逻辑生成（生成符号化工作流或可执行程序）。通过端到端双层优化联合优化两阶段。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，准确率显著优于基线（最高提升40%），并增强了透明度和错误追踪能力。

Conclusion: 双层框架为LLM提供了一种可信且系统化的推理方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断因知识表示不足、概念理解有限和临床推理受限而进展缓慢。

Method: 采用多粒度稀疏激活医学概念和分层知识图谱，结合四种匹配算法、多样性控制和五级回退策略。

Result: 在BioASQ罕见病QA集上，BLEU提升0.09，ROUGE提升0.05，准确率提升0.12，峰值准确率达0.89。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了信息质量、推理能力和专业表达，有望缩短罕见病患者的诊断周期。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种利用多模态大模型（LMM）自动地理参考生物样本记录的新方法，通过视觉化空间关系显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然历史收藏中大量未地理参考样本记录的高劳动力需求问题，现有方法未充分利用地图信息。

Method: 采用网格化方法在多模态大模型（LMM）中零样本设置下实现视觉化空间关系理解。

Result: 实验显示该方法平均距离误差约1公里，优于单模态语言模型和现有工具。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在细粒度地图理解上表现优异，提出将其整合到地理参考工作流程的实用框架。

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

*Soheyl Massoudi,Mark Fuge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估了结构化多智能体系统（MAS）在工程设计中的表现，发现其在生成详细设计图方面优于双智能体系统（2AS），但在需求覆盖率和代码兼容性上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决早期工程设计中的复杂迭代推理问题，比较多智能体系统和双智能体系统在任务连续性和可执行模型生成上的效果。

Method: 使用九角色MAS和双角色2AS，通过Design-State Graph（DSG）表示设计状态，进行60次实验，评估JSON有效性、需求覆盖率等指标。

Result: MAS生成更细粒度的DSG，但需求覆盖率低（<20%）；2AS在特定条件下代码兼容性达100%，但平均低于50%。推理蒸馏模型能可靠标记工作流完成。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体系统能增强设计细节，但需求覆盖和代码兼容性仍需改进；推理蒸馏模型提升了完成率。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leanabell-Prover-V2是一个7B参数的大型语言模型，能够生成Lean 4中的形式化定理证明，通过验证器集成的长链思维（CoT）和强化学习（RL）优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Leanabell-Prover-V1的基础上，进一步提升模型性能，通过验证器反馈使模型能够自我感知推理过程的正确性并纠正错误。

Method: 采用验证器反馈的强化学习，结合反馈令牌掩码和多轮验证器交互，优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上，性能分别提升了3.2%（Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Conclusion: Leanabell-Prover-V2通过验证器反馈和强化学习显著提升了形式化定理证明的性能，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为INoT的新型AI代理推理框架，通过设计新的LLM-Read代码提示，减少推理成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理依赖LLMs和MLLMs，但受限于其固有局限性和高推理成本。

Method: 设计LLM-Read代码提示，使LLM能执行程序化对话推理，实现自省和反思。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，性能平均提升7.95%，推理成本降低58.3%。

Conclusion: INoT框架有效提升了AI代理的性能并降低了成本，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.
Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a
reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to
accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to
enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

Result: 在未包含情感披露的冰岛语音语料库模型中，该方法提高了模型的整体可控性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用模型的不可控变化，显著提升了语音生成的可控性。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Conclusion: MedicalBERT证明了预训练模型在生物医学NLP中的潜力，展示了迁移学习的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and

domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question

such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on

Motivation: 理解越狱攻击的复杂性和演变对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 通过分析200多万条真实对话，使用多种复杂度指标（如概率测量、词汇多样性、压缩比和认知负荷指标）进行评估。

Result: 越狱攻击的复杂度未显著高于普通对话，攻击毒性稳定，AI防御机制改善。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了攻击与防御不断升级的观点，指出越狱攻击的复杂度受限于人类创造力，同时强调了学术披露可能带来的信息风险。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域的实际应用能力，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 使用金融特定数据集对FinGPT在六个NLP任务中进行评估。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现接近GPT-4，但在推理和生成任务中表现显著不足。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化以提升综合能力。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下可提供可解释的模式，但与人类判断差异显著，需谨慎部署于自动化招聘系统。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

Method: 提出三层次理解框架：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解。

Result: LLMs表现出类似理解的结构，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应将讨论从LLMs是否理解转向其独特工作机制的研究。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

Motivation: 解决从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的挑战，避免对模型进行微调，同时提升在多种知识图谱上的性能。

Method: 利用大语言模型策略性执行SPARQL查询，搜索相关IRI和字面量，无需微调。

Result: 在Wikidata上达到零射击状态下的最佳性能，在Freebase上接近少射击方法，其他知识图谱上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种知识图谱和语言模型上表现优异，展示了无需微调的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Conclusion: R3框架简单高效，适用于多种预训练模型，显著改进文本生成效果。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

Method: 提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别和减弱毒性敏感维度，无需微调或访问训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%。

Conclusion: ETTA揭示了当前对齐策略的关键漏洞，需开发嵌入感知的防御方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be

### [33] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大多数商用大型语言模型（LLM）在伦理和政治回应中表现出一致的自由主义倾向，原因包括训练数据、强化学习、学术伦理框架和安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs政治倾向的成因及其影响。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数分析七种主流LLMs。

Result: 发现LLMs普遍倾向于自由主义价值观，尤其是关怀与公平，微调会增强这一倾向。

Conclusion: 自由主义倾向是训练数据的自然结果，可能反映了集体推理的新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

TL;DR: AI辅助招聘显著提升候选人通过率和后续就业率，但倾向于选择年轻且经验较少的候选人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响，填补实证研究的空白。

Method: 随机分配37,000名申请者至传统或AI辅助招聘流程，比较最终面试通过率和后续就业情况。

Result: AI辅助流程的候选人通过率提高20个百分点，后续就业率提高5.9个百分点，但倾向于选择年轻、经验少的候选人。

Conclusion: AI技术显著优化招聘决策，但也带来潜在偏见，需进一步研究其影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

TL;DR: 研究评估了2022至2025年间生成式AI模型（LLM和VLM）在医疗图像和问题回答中免责声明的使用情况，发现其比例显著下降，呼吁需根据临床情境调整免责声明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI模型在医疗领域的应用增加，其输出中的免责声明对用户安全至关重要，但研究发现免责声明比例逐年下降，需引起重视。

Method: 使用500份乳腺X光片、500份胸片、500份皮肤科图像和500个医学问题，筛选LLM和VLM输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: LLM和VLM输出中的免责声明比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力提升，需根据临床情境动态调整免责声明，以确保用户安全。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLMs）多为纯文本模型，忽视了软件开发中常用的视觉辅助工具（如图表和流程图），导致代码生成与实际需求脱节。

Method: 开发了MM-Coder模型，结合视觉工作流（Visual Workflow）和文本指令，并构建了多模态指令调优数据集MMc-Instruct，以及新的评估基准MMEval。

Result: 评估显示，模型在精确捕捉视觉信息、遵循指令和高级编程知识方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: MM-Coder旨在通过多模态输入（文本和视觉设计）实现复杂规范的解读与实现，推动工业编程的革新。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs在心理健康理解任务中表现接近LLMs，尤其在二元分类任务中仅相差2%。尽管参数少得多，SLMs通过少样本学习显著提升性能，显示出作为隐私保护工具的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SLMs在敏感应用（如心理健康理解）中的能力，以评估其作为隐私保护替代方案的可行性。

Method: 采用零样本和少样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs与三种LLMs在六项心理健康任务中的表现。

Result: SLMs在二元分类任务中表现接近LLMs（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），少样本学习使SLMs性能提升14.6%。多类任务中两者表现均下降30%以上。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，尤其适合隐私敏感的数据分析，少样本学习使其成为可扩展的筛查工具候选。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM因缺乏上下文信息而导致的低质量回答或幻觉问题，通过外部工具提供实时数据和计算能力。

Method: 开发框架，集成外部API以获取额外信息，支持计算器、日历等功能，并在MMLU数据集上评估。

Result: Athena框架在数学推理和科学推理上分别达到83%和88%的准确率，显著优于GPT-4o等基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建围绕LLM的复杂计算生态系统铺平道路，使其更自然地支持多样化任务。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统回顾了68篇关于医学视觉问答（MedVQA）的文献，并调查了50名临床医生，发现MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际效用有限，主要问题包括数据集和模型的不足以及评估指标与临床需求的不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在临床工作流程中的实际应用价值，识别其挑战和差距，以促进其更好地服务于医疗诊断。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献回顾和临床医生调查，分析MedVQA的现状和问题。

Result: 研究发现60%的问答对缺乏临床相关性，数据集和模型不支持多视图、多分辨率成像等关键功能，且评估指标与临床需求不匹配。临床医生中仅29.8%认为MedVQA系统高度有用。

Conclusion: MedVQA具有潜力，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景等问题，以实现有效的临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

Motivation: 现有方法假设语言模型仅通过少样本提示就能生成有效计划，但缺乏验证。CRISP旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 自动生成并验证高层次的计划数据集CRISP，用于数学推理和代码生成。通过微调小模型评估计划质量。

Result: 微调小模型生成的计划质量优于少样本提示的大模型，且显著优于CoT推理。跨领域评估显示泛化能力强。

Conclusion: CRISP证明了通过微调小模型可以高效生成高质量计划，且具备跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了支持或自动化研究过程中的消融实验设计，提出了AblationBench基准。

Method: 开发了基于语言模型的自动评估框架，包含AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation两个任务。

Result: 最佳语言模型系统平均仅识别29%的原始消融实验，思维链提示优于现有基于代理的方法。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在消融实验设计任务中仍有局限性，思维链提示表现更优。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul是一个多轮对话LLM推理系统，通过动态选择压缩策略和优化KV缓存恢复，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多轮对话中KV缓存的恢复效率低，且静态压缩策略忽略了对话间的注意力模式差异，导致准确性下降。

Method: Krul引入动态压缩策略选择器、令牌级异质注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器，优化KV缓存恢复。

Result: 实验表明，Krul在TTFT和KV缓存存储上分别减少了1.5x-2.68x和1.33x-2.35x，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul通过动态策略和优化恢复流程，显著提升了多轮对话中LLM的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: 该框架为LM的负责任使用提供了透明、可审计的解决方案，适用于多个实际决策工作流。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

TL;DR: Compactor是一种无需参数、与查询无关的KV缓存压缩策略，通过近似杠杆分数确定令牌重要性，减少内存负担，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs中长上下文生成时KV缓存内存占用高的问题，降低部署成本和资源瓶颈。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数进行令牌重要性评估，提出上下文校准压缩方法。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中保留一半令牌，KV内存负担减少63%，性能与竞争方法相当。

Conclusion: Compactor在多种任务和模型上表现出高效性和通用性，显著降低内存需求。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的场景（如智能手机）中，SLM需要保留LLM的共情能力以支持良好的人机交互。

Method: 采用两阶段微调过程，利用LLM生成的共情对话数据集，并设计了四种针对性提示以改进共情蒸馏。

Result: 经过改进的SLM在生成共情回应时胜率达到90%，比基础提示方法提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLM的共情能力，为人机交互提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

### [47] [Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218)
*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLMs的OOCR现象源于LoRA微调中引入的恒定转向向量，该向量引导模型泛化到相关概念领域，甚至适用于看似需要条件行为的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs为何能在微调后展现出超出分布的泛化能力（OOCR），以理解其安全可靠部署的关键能力。

Method: 通过机理分析，发现OOCR现象的解释是LoRA微调添加的恒定转向向量；进一步通过直接训练转向向量验证其效果。

Result: 恒定转向向量能显著提升微调任务及相关概念领域的性能，甚至在模型后门任务中也有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调过程中学习的内容，为LLMs的OOCR能力提供了简单解释，对其安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为代理学生在智能辅导系统（ITSs）中的表现，发现未经指导的强模型普遍优于真实学生，而弱模型或领域不匹配的模型可能偶然对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs作为代理学生在教育评估中的准确性，以确定其是否能真实模拟学生的行为和特征。

Method: 收集了489项NAEP测试题目，应用IRT模型将11种LLMs与真实学生能力进行比较，并测试了年级强制提示的效果。

Result: 强模型普遍优于学生，弱模型可能偶然对齐；年级强制提示的效果因模型和提示而异，无模型在所有年级和科目中表现一致。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练和评估策略，并提供了基于研究结果的代理选择指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究常忽视性别在疼痛体验中的作用，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用NLP和HAM-CNN模型对帖子进行分类，并通过用户名聚合数据。

Result: F1分数为0.86，发现女性帖子更情绪化，某些疼痛症状在女性中更普遍。

Conclusion: 性别在疼痛体验中有显著差异，需在治疗中考虑性别因素。

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

TL;DR: Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT) 是一个40B开源大语言模型，通过动态切换推理模式解决过度思考问题，显著减少token使用并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理密集型任务中的过度思考问题，提高效率和可控性。

Method: 构建双机制数据集，采用多令牌预测增强的知识蒸馏，冷启动初始化策略，以及Step-SRPO强化学习算法。

Result: KAT在多个基准测试中匹配或超越现有SOTA模型，token使用减少约30%，并在实际部署中表现优异。

Conclusion: AutoThink范式具有可扩展性，未来200B MoE模型将进一步优化性能与效率。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档图像任务中表现优异，但在跨模态和跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务中存在遗忘OCR能力的挑战。

Method: 引入SSR微调范式，模型在生成翻译文本前先自检OCR文本，利用其单语OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法在多模态大语言模型的微调中表现出色，平衡了OCR和翻译能力的学习。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多代理系统，帮助商家生成高质量的消息模板和写作指导，提升CRM效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商家在私人领域渠道（如即时通讯和电子邮件）中缺乏撰写有说服力内容的专业知识和工具，CRMAgent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CRMAgent通过三种模式工作：基于群体的学习、检索与适应、基于规则的备用方案。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原有模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent为商家提供了一种可扩展且高效的工具，提升了CRM活动的效果。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练文本重排器中的效果，发现知识蒸馏在有大模型教师时表现更优，否则对比学习更可靠。


<details>

Motivation: 需要明确对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练跨编码器重排器中的实际效果差异。

Method: 通过在同一数据上训练不同大小和架构的重排器，并使用强对比学习模型作为教师进行知识蒸馏。

Result: 知识蒸馏在大模型教师时表现优于对比学习，但在教师模型容量相同时优势不明显。

Conclusion: 推荐在大模型教师可用时使用知识蒸馏，否则选择对比学习。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Motivation: 系统研究在金融领域中如何充分释放LLMs和RLLMs的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs，评估提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法对金融问答任务的影响。

Result: 提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链推理提升LLMs性能；RLLMs因固有长链推理能力限制了常规方法的提升效果；多语言对齐方法对LLMs有效但对RLLMs效果有限。

Conclusion: 本研究为金融问答领域中LLMs和RLLMs的应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Result: n-gram指标在融合性语言中表现较差，神经指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现更优，且适当的分词可改善效果。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在融合性语言中存在局限，建议更多投资于神经指标的训练和应用。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Method: 研究微调数据的真实性与长文本生成任务中幻觉的关系，比较不同数据配置的效果，包括高质量事实数据和模型生成数据。

Result: 微调模型生成并通过模型自身判断过滤的数据在事实性上表现最佳，优于其他配置。

Conclusion: 模型自身的信念可以作为事实性的有效信号，为减少幻觉提供新思路。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential
across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research
methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a
systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains

integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By
providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and
applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑中实现最新性能，确保内部逻辑一致性。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化框架（Misattribution Framework）和数据集（AttriData），用于系统分类和归因LLM的错误，并开发了首个通用评估模型（MisAttributionLLM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估模型缺乏错误归因能力，需开发自动化框架以高效分析模型性能和诊断错误。

Method: 建立包含6个主要和15个次要类别的错误归因框架，创建AttriData数据集，并基于此微调MisAttributionLLM模型。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，MisAttributionLLM能同时生成评分、错误归因和反馈。

Conclusion: 提出的框架、数据集和模型为LLM错误分析提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

### [63] [Using Large Language Models for Legal Decision-Making in Austrian Value-Added Tax Law: An Experimental Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08468)
*Marina Luketina,Andrea Benkel,Christoph G. Schuetz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在奥地利和欧盟增值税法律框架下辅助法律决策的能力，重点关注微调和检索增强生成（RAG）两种方法。结果表明，LLMs可以支持税务顾问自动化常规任务并提供初步分析，但尚未实现完全自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务咨询中，客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLMs有望减轻税务专业人员的工作负担。但由于法律领域对分析和论证的严格要求，LLMs的幻觉倾向成为挑战。

Method: 研究采用微调和检索增强生成（RAG）两种方法，应用于教科书案例和实际税务咨询案例，评估LLMs的法律推理能力及最佳配置。

Result: LLMs在适当配置下能有效支持增值税任务并提供法律依据，但处理隐含客户知识和上下文特定文档时仍有局限。

Conclusion: LLMs在税务咨询中具有潜力，但需进一步整合结构化背景信息以实现更广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work
proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in
combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025
Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM),
achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

Conclusion: 研究为教育论文连贯性的自动评分提供了一种潜在改进方法。

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

Motivation: 研究LLMs是否能提升LDA在文本挖掘中的性能，特别是在初始化和后校正阶段。

Method: 在LDA的初始化和后校正阶段集成LLMs，通过实验评估LLM引导的初始化和后校正的效果。

Result: LLM引导的初始化对LDA收敛无影响且表现最差，但后校正显著提升了5.86%的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在LDA中的后校正阶段具有实际价值，但并非在所有情况下都优于传统方法。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Conclusion: ASR转录的说话人归属性能可能优于人工转录，因转录错误可能揭示说话人特征。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在形式化非正式数学时因多语言平行语料库数量和质量限制而面临的瓶颈。

Result: 生成了60,000多个问题的平行语料库，在MiniF2F上达到88.9%的语法准确率，优于Deepseek-V3和Herald。

Conclusion: KELPS框架在形式化数学任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了高质量的数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异性能，支持实时知识融合。

Conclusion: KGA框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了无需参数更新的动态知识增强。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Motivation: 旨在通过简单干预提升小语言模型的链式推理能力，使其更显式、多步推理。

Method: 利用GPT-4生成的推理轨迹构建引导向量，直接干预键值缓存。

Result: 实验表明，该方法改善了推理结构和任务性能，且比连续干预技术更高效稳定。

Conclusion: 缓存引导是一种更稳健、实用的控制生成解决方案。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Abstract: This report presents the CuriosAI team's submission to the EgoExo4D
Proficiency Estimation Challenge at CVPR 2025. We propose two methods for

*Mihir Gupta,Abhay Mangla,Ross Greer,Pratik Desai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家评估与自一致性机制的农业图像处理框架，显著提升了玉米叶病识别的准确性、症状分析和治疗建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在农业领域表现不佳，需要一种更可靠的解决方案以支持精准农业。

Method: 结合基于提示的专家评估协议和余弦一致性自投票机制，优化了图像分析的输出。

Result: 诊断准确率从82.2%提升至87.8%，症状分析从38.9%提升至52.2%，治疗建议从27.8%提升至43.3%。

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

### [80] [Towards Evaluating Robustness of Prompt Adherence in Text to Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08039)
*Sujith Vemishetty,Advitiya Arora,Anupama Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估文本到图像模型的新框架，重点关注其对提示的遵循能力，并揭示了模型在生成简单二进制图像时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM和文本到图像模型的研究相对较少，其可靠性和性能评估不足，因此需要建立一个全面的评估框架。

Method: 通过创建新数据集，利用GPT-4生成真实图像描述，再通过文本到图像模型生成人工图像，最后比较两者的描述差异。

Result: 模型在生成简单二进制图像时表现不佳，且无法遵循输入数据集的分布。

Conclusion: 当前文本到图像模型在遵循提示和生成特定分布图像方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

### [81] [ConsNoTrainLoRA: Data-driven Weight Initialization of Low-rank Adapters using Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08044)
*Debasmit Das,Hyoungwoo Park,Munawar Hayat,Seokeon Choi,Sungrack Yun,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CNTLoRA的数据驱动权重初始化方法，改进了LoRA微调的收敛性和性能，无需训练即可初始化权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA权重矩阵随机初始化且固定秩，限制了性能。本文通过数据驱动方法优化初始化，提升微调效果。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域偏移问题，利用预训练和微调激活的约束条件，推导出闭式权重估计，支持可变秩初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准及数据驱动初始化方法，收敛更快且性能更优。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了一种高效初始化方案，显著提升LoRA微调效果，并通过分析验证了其设计合理性。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

### [82] [A Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine for Image Classification with an Application to Quadcopters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08047)
*Rolando A. Hernandez-Hernandez,Adrian Rubio-Solis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ELM-AE和区间类型2模糊逻辑的混合多层极限学习机（HML-ELM），用于无人机图像分类，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多层极限学习机（ML-ELM）在自然信号分类中表现良好，但需要进一步提升效率和准确性，尤其是在无人机图像分类任务中。

Method: HML-ELM采用两阶段框架：1）通过堆叠ELM-AE实现无监督特征提取；2）使用简化的区间类型2模糊ELM（SIT2-FELM）进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，HML-ELM在基准图像分类和无人机实际任务中均优于ML-ELM、ML-FELM和ELM。

Conclusion: HML-ELM是一种高效且准确的图像分类方法，特别适用于无人机应用。

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [84] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在去噪算法中使用非高斯噪声（如均匀分布或Beta分布）的性能表现，而非修改算法以适应噪声类型。实验在小型设备上进行，结果在不同情境下的适用性仍有待验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高斯噪声以外的噪声类型对基于扩散模型的去噪算法性能的影响，探索算法在非理想条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用均匀分布、Beta分布或混合高斯噪声替换原始高斯噪声，保持算法不变，评估其性能。

Result: 实验在小型设备上进行，初步观察了算法在非高斯噪声下的表现，但结果在不同情境下的普适性尚不明确。

Conclusion: 算法在非高斯噪声下的性能表现值得进一步研究，尤其是在不同计算环境和图像规模下的适用性。

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

### [85] [An Object-Based Deep Learning Approach for Building Height Estimation from Single SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08096)
*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化建筑高度估计方法，使用单张VHR SAR图像，通过目标检测和回归实现，并在多大陆数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度建筑高度估计对城市应用至关重要，现有方法在跨城市和跨大陆泛化能力上存在不足。

Method: 采用基于边界框检测的目标回归方法，使用多大陆数据集进行训练和交叉验证。

Result: 在欧洲城市表现优异（MAE约2.20米），但在亚洲等高楼密集区域泛化能力有所下降。

Conclusion: 深度学习在单张VHR SAR图像建筑高度估计中具有强大的跨城市和跨大陆迁移学习潜力。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

### [86] [RegGS: Unposed Sparse Views Gaussian Splatting with 3DGS Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08136)
*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS提出了一种基于3D高斯注册的框架，用于重建无姿态稀疏视图，通过熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法和联合注册模块，实现了高保真度的局部高斯对齐和高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法在稀疏视图下表现不佳，且前馈高斯方法受限于输入格式，难以整合更多视图。

Method: RegGS利用熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法计算最优传输Mixture 2-Wasserstein距离，并设计联合注册模块整合距离、光度一致性和深度几何。

Result: 在RE10K和ACID数据集上，RegGS实现了高保真的局部高斯对齐，精确的相机姿态估计和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: RegGS通过全局一致的高斯表示和联合优化，有效解决了稀疏视图下的3D重建问题。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

*Hyungjun Doh,Dong In Lee,Seunggeun Chi,Pin-Hao Huang,Kwonjoon Lee,Sangpil Kim,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频重建动态人-物交互的新框架，解决了遮挡和时间不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态物体或完全可见的动态主体，导致在遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 利用模态补全推断部分遮挡区域的完整结构，结合时间上下文增强视频序列的一致性。

Result: 在单目视频上验证，展示了对遮挡和时间稳定性的优越处理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国城市道路障碍物多，视障人士日常通勤易受伤，亟需一种能提前预警的系统。

Result: 实现了轻量化的实时深度估计和物体检测模型，mAP50为0.801。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效帮助视障人士避免碰撞，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

### [90] [HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205)
*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HNOSeg-XS是一种基于Hartley变换的分割架构，解决了CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中的分辨率限制问题，具有高效性和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN和Transformer在医学图像分割中分别存在局部感受野限制和计算复杂度高的问题，且输入尺寸缩减可能导致次优结果。

Method: 提出HNOSeg-XS架构，通过可学习的偏微分方程建模分割问题，利用Hartley变换在频域中实现分辨率鲁棒性。

Result: 在BraTS'23等数据集上，HNOSeg-XS表现出色，参数少于34.7k，推理时间<0.24秒，内存占用<1.8 GiB。

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS是一种高效、分辨率鲁棒的医学图像分割方法，优于传统CNN和Transformer模型。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决StarDist-3D在实例参数化维度与体素分辨率之间的耦合问题，并避免上采样时的体素化伪影。

Method: 修改StarDist-3D架构，使用双三次贝塞尔三角形表示封闭表面，支持任意高分辨率预测。

Result: 在生物医学成像中，SurfDist能以更紧凑的参数化优于StarDist-3D。

Conclusion: 可解释的实例表面模型可以与实例成员关系一起有效学习。

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中缺乏客观测量运动功能的方法，限制了生物力学测量的广泛应用。PBL旨在填补这一空白，提供一种可扩展、低负担的工具。

Method: 开发了PBL系统，包括云支持的智能手机应用和生物力学模型拟合算法，并在神经外科和运动医学诊所进行了验证。

Result: PBL的关节角度误差在3度以内，步态指标具有高可靠性，并能敏感地反映临床差异，如与mJOA评分的相关性。

Conclusion: PBL为临床提供了一种便携、可靠的生物力学测量工具，有望广泛应用于运动障碍的监测。

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone
video at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CR-Net的新方法，结合结构先验和证据学习理论，解决了SAR目标检测中跨分辨率域适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SAR分辨率的提升，散射特性差异增大，导致目标检测模型的泛化能力下降，传统域适应技术存在盲特征适应和不可靠语义传播的问题。

Method: CR-Net包含结构诱导的层次特征适应（SHFA）和可靠结构邻接对齐（RSAA）模块，分别实现结构感知的特征适应和可靠的语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，CR-Net在跨分辨率SAR目标检测中显著提升了性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: CR-Net通过保留域内结构和增强判别能力，有效解决了跨分辨率域适应问题。

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Motivation: 现有3D方法在运动建模和内容合成中存在渲染伪影（如运动模糊、时间抖动和局部穿透），限制了稳定、细粒度运动场的表示。

Method: 提出统一框架，包括视频预处理、运动表示和渲染重建；采用多粒度运动解耦策略独立建模非刚性和刚性运动，并引入运动一致性约束和交替优化策略。

Conclusion: M2DAO-Talker通过改进的运动建模和优化策略，显著提升了说话头生成的视觉效果和实时性能。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Conclusion: 该方法为颅骨与面部图像的跨域匹配提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中取得进展，但模型大且不透明限制了临床应用。

Method: 通过选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现针对性压缩，保持临床意义表征。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率和低精度损失。

Conclusion: 为医疗场景中轻量、可解释模型的部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Result: 在StyleGAN2预训练模型上实验表明，CoCo-Bot提升了概念级可控性和可解释性，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot通过消除辅助线索，实现了更纯粹的概念传递和更强的后处理能力。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Result: 在四种癌症类型基准测试中表现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且稳健的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Result: MRAG在实验中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MRAG通过多范围表示和对抗性扰动，显著提升了隐写图像的隐蔽性和恢复能力。

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 提出Cycle Context Verification (CCV)框架，通过自验证预测和增强上下文对齐，提升基于ICL的医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICL在医学图像分割中因上下文对齐不足和标注数据稀缺导致的性能问题。

Result: 在七个数据集上验证，CCV优于现有方法，提升ICL分割性能。

Conclusion: CCV是通用医学图像分割的鲁棒解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在交通场景解读中的潜力，尤其是针对老年驾驶员评估的相关任务，以提升驾驶风险评估工具的实用性。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和多样本提示策略，评估模型性能，使用精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评价指标。

Result: 提示设计显著提升性能，例如交叉口可见性召回率从21.7%升至57.0%。模型在停车标志检测中表现出高精确率（86.3%）但召回率较低（76.7%）。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示可使大语言模型成为驾驶风险评估的有力辅助工具，未来需进一步研究扩展性和模型架构优化。

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

methods, categorise by their fundamental approaches, including domain
translation, self-supervision signal design and blind spot or noise-based
methods. We also provide a categorization of loss functions employed in

Motivation: 传统方法将低光增强和视觉理解分开处理，导致泛化能力受限且缺乏可扩展性。GEFU旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型进行零样本泛化优化，并提出SCUF方法，包括光照感知图像提示和循环注意力适配器，以及语义一致性约束。

Result: 在图像质量和下游任务（分类、检测、语义分割）中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GEFU通过结合增强与理解，显著提升了低光视觉任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

Result: 数据集展示了密集重叠对象、全画布空间分布等挑战性特性，并通过二次研究凸显其难度。

Conclusion: ODOR数据集推动了艺术品目标检测和视觉文化遗产研究，并探索了目标识别与嗅觉感知的交叉领域。

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

*Zhanxin Gao,Beier Zhu,Liang Yao,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi是一个两阶段框架，通过身份传输和身份细化，在保持主题一致性的同时实现多样化的姿势和布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在保持主题一致性时牺牲姿势和布局多样性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：身份传输（IT）和身份细化（IR），分别处理早期和后期去噪步骤。

Result: 在主题一致性、姿势多样性和提示保真度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CoDi在视觉感知和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

TL;DR: PanMatch是一个通用的基础模型，用于鲁棒的对应匹配任务，通过统一的2D位移估计框架实现多任务集成，无需特定任务架构或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要任务特定架构和领域微调的问题，提出一种通用的位移估计框架，实现多任务集成。

Method: 利用大型视觉模型的全能特征提取器和特征转换管道，构建跨领域数据集（约180万样本）预训练PanMatch。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，在任务特定基准测试中与最先进算法相当，并在异常场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: PanMatch通过统一的位移估计框架和全能特征提取器，实现了多任务的高效集成和鲁棒性能。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖数据无关算法生成哈希中心，忽略了类间语义关系，可能降低检索性能。

Method: 提出三阶段框架SHC：1）分类网络识别语义相似性；2）优化算法生成语义哈希中心；3）深度哈希网络训练生成哈希码。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，SHC在MAP@100、MAP@1000和MAP@ALL指标上分别平均提升7.26%、7.62%和11.71%。

Conclusion: SHC通过保留语义结构，显著提升了大规模图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP提出了一种新的条件提示学习方法，通过多模态大语言模型生成语义条件提示，并结合视觉条件提示，提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有提示学习方法在未见类别的泛化能力不足以及跨模态对齐局限于输出层的问题。

Method: 引入多模态相互引导条件提示学习（MuGCP），包括语义条件提示（SCP）、视觉条件提示（VCP）和多提示融合（MPF）机制。

Result: 在14个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MuGCP通过多模态条件提示生成和融合，显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

TL;DR: InstaScene提出了一种新的3D感知范式，旨在分解复杂场景中的实例并实现完整重建，通过空间对比学习和原位生成技术显著提升了分解和重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能自然识别和补全遮挡物体，但机器人缺乏类似能力，现有技术无法从部分观察中识别完整物体。

Method: 开发了空间对比学习技术，通过追踪实例在多视图中的光栅化来增强语义监督；引入原位生成技术，利用观察和几何线索指导3D生成模型。

Result: 在复杂场景分解和物体补全实验中，方法表现出更高的分解精度和几何完整性。

Conclusion: InstaScene在3D场景感知中实现了实例分解和完整重建的突破。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually
intact objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练自由的框架RALU，通过空间维度加速扩散变换器的推理，显著减少计算量并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在图像和视频生成中表现出色，但计算量大阻碍实际部署，现有加速方法主要关注时间维度。

Method: RALU采用三阶段混合分辨率采样：低分辨率去噪、区域自适应上采样和全分辨率细节细化，结合噪声时间步重调度稳定生成。

Result: 在FLUX上实现7.0倍加速，Stable Diffusion 3上3.0倍加速，图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: RALU与现有时间加速方法互补，可无缝集成进一步降低延迟且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决复杂场景中修复不一致的问题，生成更真实的3D修复结果。

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: VFMTok展示了预训练模型在图像分词任务中的潜力，为社区提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Result: 通过实验验证了该方法在单音乐谱、形状图和简化工程图等复杂记录结构中的有效性，并首次成功实现了工程图的端到端转录。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计文档识别系统提供了新思路，并为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,
F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical
heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be

Conclusion: OGFR通过知识蒸馏和特征净化，显著提升了遮挡行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RadiomicsRetrieval框架，结合手工放射组学特征与深度学习嵌入，支持3D医学图像检索，提升临床灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法主要支持2D图像且需完整标注查询，限制了临床应用。

Method: 结合放射组学特征与深度学习嵌入，利用可提示分割模型（如SAM）生成肿瘤特异性嵌入，并通过对比学习对齐特征，加入解剖位置嵌入（APE）丰富表示。

Result: 在肺部CT和脑部MRI数据集上验证，放射组学特征提升检索特异性，APE支持基于位置的搜索。

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval框架仅需最小用户提示，支持多样化临床场景，有望推动诊断、治疗规划和大规模医学影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SAM 2通过强化学习优化内存更新，显著提升视觉目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工规则更新内存，难以应对干扰、遮挡和运动问题。

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，使用强化学习优化SAM 2的内存更新。

Result: 在单视频过拟合实验中，性能提升超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习是内存控制的有效替代方案，揭示了内存银行的潜力。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

TL;DR: DA-KPN是一种新的图像翻译方法，通过轻量级翻译函数和像素级输入变换参数，确保合成标签与翻译之间的语义匹配，优于基于GAN的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义分割中因合成数据与真实数据域差距导致的性能下降问题，特别是在低数据量情况下。

Method: 提出DA-KPN，估计像素级输入变换参数，使用多尺度判别器确保翻译的逼真性。

Result: 在syn2real基准测试中优于GAN方法，在人脸解析任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: DA-KPN在低数据量下有效提升语义分割性能，确保语义匹配。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将体素作为基本交互单元，限制了类别级信息的利用，而类别级信息对提升补全结果的粒度至关重要。

Method: 提出DISC双流范式，用判别性类别查询替代体素查询，并结合类别特性设计专用解码模块。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中达到SOTA性能，单帧输入甚至优于多帧方法。

Conclusion: DISC通过分离优化实例和场景类别，显著提升了3D语义场景补全的性能。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset

2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出BayesTTA方法，解决视觉语言模型在时间演化分布偏移下的持续测试时适应问题，通过贝叶斯框架实现时间一致性预测和动态视觉表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续测试时适应方法忽视时间连续性，导致记忆缓存有限、熵置信度不可靠及静态视觉表示与演化输入不对齐。

Method: BayesTTA采用贝叶斯框架，增量估计类条件高斯混合分布，自适应选择协方差结构，并通过GDA进行校准推理。

Result: 在四个时间演化数据集和十个标准TTA数据集上，BayesTTA显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BayesTTA有效解决了时间演化分布偏移下的持续适应问题，具有高效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究如何通过最小化训练数据和标注工作量，优化DAN在手写文档转录中的性能。

Method: 使用两种不同标注方法的数据集（201份出生证明扫描件），对DAN进行微调。

Result: 标准化标注对可标准化字段（如日期、出生地）更有效，而原始标注对不可标准化字段（如姓名）表现更好。

Conclusion: 标注策略应根据字段特性选择，标准化标注适用于可标准化字段，原始标注适用于不可标准化字段。

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

TL;DR: OnlineBEV提出了一种基于循环结构的时间3D感知方法，通过MBFNet实现时间特征对齐，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多帧BEV特征的时间聚合性能受限，主要由于物体运动导致特征动态变化。

Method: 使用循环结构结合BEV特征，MBFNet提取运动特征并动态对齐历史与当前特征，辅以时间一致性学习损失。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到63.9% NDS，性能优于当前最佳方法SOLOFusion。

Conclusion: OnlineBEV通过时间特征对齐和循环结构，在相机3D检测任务中实现了最先进性能。

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

<details>

Motivation: 传统手动收集和标注图像数据集的方法耗时且低效，而生成数据虽然提供了解决方案，但真实世界数据更具价值。

Method: 使用多智能体协作系统和MLLMs，结合图像优化工具包，根据用户需求自动构建数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从零创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent能够高效构建高质量图像数据集，为视觉任务提供支持。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型（7T-Restormer），用于从常规1.5T或3T T1加权图像合成7T质量的T1图，解决了7T MRI成本高和稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI虽然分辨率高，但成本昂贵且稀缺，且存在易感性伪影等问题。通过合成7T质量的图像，可以降低对7T扫描仪的依赖。

Method: 使用35例1.5T和108例3T T1加权MRI与对应的7T T1图进行验证，模型在训练、验证和测试集上进行了评估，并与ResViT和ResShift模型进行了比较。

Result: 7T-Restormer在1.5T和3T输入下均表现优异，PSNR和SSIM指标优于其他模型，且参数更少。混合1.5T和3T训练优于单一策略。

Conclusion: 该方法能从1.5T和3T T1加权图像高效预测7T MP2RAGE图，质量优于现有方法，使7T MRI的优势更易应用于临床。

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理和基础任务中表现不足，ByDeWay旨在通过深度感知提示解决这些问题，无需修改模型参数。

Method: 使用单目深度估计将场景分为近、中、远三层，生成区域特定描述，并将其附加到图像-问题提示中，增强空间上下文。

Result: 在POPE和GQA基准测试中，ByDeWay显著减少了幻觉并提升了推理能力，适用于多种MLLMs。

Conclusion: ByDeWay证明了深度感知提示在零训练设置下的有效性，为MLLMs提供了一种轻量级、模块化的改进方案。

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像的表示学习提供了一种高效解决方案，特别适用于低标签和高类重叠场景。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer

model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS

*Li Li,Yingzhe Peng,Xu Yang,Ruoxi Cheng,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级CLIP（L-CLIP）的新型嵌入式字幕评价指标L-CLIPScore，用于高效评估字幕质量和训练字幕模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕评价指标在计算资源和时间上效率不足，需要一种更高效的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 通过权重复用和矩阵分解压缩CLIP架构，并设计多模态相似性调节器（SR）损失进行知识蒸馏。

Result: L-CLIP在保持与原CLIP相当的多模态对齐能力的同时，显著减少了计算资源和运行时间。

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore作为字幕评价指标高效有效，但训练字幕模型时需与n-gram指标混合使用以避免训练失败。

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

TL;DR: SGPMIL是一种基于稀疏高斯过程的概率注意力MIL框架，通过量化实例级注意力分数的不确定性，提高了预测的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有确定性注意力MIL方法在实例级不确定性量化上的不足。

Method: 引入SGPMIL框架，利用稀疏高斯过程学习注意力分数的后验分布，并加入特征缩放以优化性能。

Result: 在多个数字病理数据集上，SGPMIL在袋级和实例级评估中均表现优异，且训练更快。

Conclusion: SGPMIL不仅保持了袋级性能，还显著提升了实例级预测的质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有数据集在场景复杂度、分辨率和多样性方面存在不足，难以满足实际应用需求。

Method: 构建RoundaboutHD数据集，包含40分钟4K分辨率视频，512辆车的标注数据，支持多任务分析。

Result: 提供了车辆检测、单摄像头跟踪、车辆重识别和多摄像头跟踪的基线结果。

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD为多摄像头车辆跟踪研究提供了更接近真实场景的数据支持。

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera
tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The
dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at:

Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中训练数据不足的问题，通过集成低相关性的弱学习器提升模型性能。

Method: 使用基于STV特征的弱学习器集成方法，STV特征能有效表征多尺度纹理，且特征间相关性低。

Result: 在医学影像任务中，STV学习器（AUC=0.87）优于神经网络（AUC=0.75）和Radiomics（AUC=0.79），尤其是CT图像中的精细STV尺度对PET高摄取预测效果显著。

Conclusion: 基于STV特征的集成学习方法在数据不足的场景下表现优异，尤其在医学影像分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Method: 提出HieraRS范式，结合BHCCM机制生成分层预测，并设计TransLU框架支持跨域迁移，构建MM-5B数据集。

Result: HieraRS提高了语义一致性和分类精度，TransLU支持动态类别扩展和异构层次适应。

Conclusion: HieraRS和TransLU有效解决了遥感图像分层分类的挑战，提升了模型的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic
consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a
dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components:
Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment
(CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the
effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition,
we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset
featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released
at: https://github.com/AI-Tianlong/HieraRS.

Result: 实验表明FedMeta-GeoLane在几何误差和泛化能力上优于基线方法，同时显著减少通信开销。

Conclusion: 该框架为灵活、上下文感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，并已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在零样本分割中的优异表现，压缩这些模型成为迫切需求，以提升部署效率。

Method: 提出Hyper-Compression算法，将高维参数向量转化为低维标量，并设计HyperLinear层加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，Birkhoff压缩比达5.17x，性能下降小于1%，压缩时间少于60秒。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、通用的压缩方法，适用于SAM及其变体，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Result: 模型在10,000张MNIST测试图像上达到99.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 深度特征提取和足够的原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，模型可扩展至其他模式识别任务。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: CoPart通过部分感知的潜在表示和相互引导策略，显著提升了3D生成的细节和可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

Conclusion: CLiFTs方法在高效渲染和动态调整方面表现出色，为神经渲染提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器存在架构偏离、依赖外部编码器或高延迟问题，Lumos-1旨在保留LLM架构的同时提升视频生成效率。

Result: 在48个GPU上预训练的Lumos-1性能媲美EMU3、COSMOS-Video2World和OpenSoraPlan等先进模型。

Conclusion: Lumos-1通过轻量化架构改进和高效训练策略，实现了高性能的自回归视频生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

where users provide both a natural language condition and a query table,
enabling intuitive and flexible table discovery for users of all expertise
levels. To handle this, we propose Crofuma, a cross-fusion-based approach that
learns and aggregates single-modal and cross-modal matching scores.
Experimental results show Crofuma outperforms SOTA single-input methods by at
least 12% on NDCG@5. We also release an instructional video, codebase,

TableCopilot sets a new standard for interactive table assistants, making

Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF

need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and
consistency.

Abstract: We present ONION, a multi-layered framework for participatory
Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling that integrates insights from design justice,
participatory AI, and conceptual modeling. ONION introduces a five-stage
methodology: Observe, Nurture, Integrate, Optimize, Normalize. It supports
progressive abstraction from unstructured stakeholder input to structured ER
diagrams.
  Our approach aims to reduce designer bias, promote inclusive participation,
and increase transparency through the modeling process. We evaluate ONION
through real-world workshops focused on sociotechnical systems in Ukraine,
highlighting how diverse stakeholder engagement leads to richer data models and
deeper mutual understanding. Early results demonstrate ONION's potential to
host diversity in early-stage data modeling. We conclude with lessons learned,
limitations and challenges involved in scaling and refining the framework for
broader adoption.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于bottom-k哈希的高效模式集挖掘方法，以重构误差作为衡量标准，并在合成和真实数据集中验证了其优于贪心算法的速度和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式集挖掘是数据挖掘中的核心问题，但现有方法在效率和效果上存在不足，需要一种更高效的方法来找到高质量的模式集。

Method: 采用基于bottom-k哈希的方法，高效选择模式集，并扩展该方法以处理模式在数据中可能以近似形式出现的情况。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中，哈希方法比标准贪心算法显著更快，同时结果质量接近。

Conclusion: 基于哈希的方法在速度和效果上均表现优异，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Pattern set mining, which is the task of finding a good set of patterns
instead of all patterns, is a fundamental problem in data mining. Many
different definitions of what constitutes a good set have been proposed in
recent years. In this paper, we consider the reconstruction error as a proxy
measure for the goodness of the set, and concentrate on the adjacent problem of
how to find a good set efficiently. We propose a method based on bottom-k
hashing for efficiently selecting the set and extend the method for the common
case where the patterns might only appear in approximate form in the data. Our
approach has applications in tiling databases, Boolean matrix factorization,
and redescription mining, among others. We show that our hashing-based approach
is significantly faster than the standard greedy algorithm while obtaining
almost equally good results in both synthetic and real-world data sets.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的两层架构，解决BFT系统中安全性与响应性之间的冲突，通过分离交互操作与共识确认，实现低延迟（<200ms）且保持强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BFT网络服务在分布式应用中提供关键完整性保障，但高延迟阻碍了交互式用户体验。

Method: 采用两层架构：会话感知的事务缓冲层（Layer 2）提供即时反馈，定期将批量操作提交至完全BFT共识层（Layer 1）。

Result: Layer 2操作比Layer 1快四倍，同时保持端到端事务完整性。

Conclusion: 该架构使BFT应用在延迟敏感领域（如元宇宙）变得可行，实现响应式交互与状态一致性。

Abstract: Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) web services provide critical integrity
guarantees for distributed applications but face significant latency challenges
that hinder interactive user experiences. We propose a novel two-layer
architecture that addresses this fundamental tension between security and
responsiveness in BFT systems. Our approach introduces a session-aware
transaction buffer layer (Layer 2) that delivers immediate feedback to users
through consensus simulation, while periodically committing batched operations
to a fully Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus layer (Layer 1). By separating
interactive operations from consensus finalization, our system achieves
responsive user experiences of under 200ms, while maintaining strong BFT
security guarantees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture through a
supply chain management implementation, where operators require both immediate
feedback during multi-step workflows and tamper-proof record keeping. Our
evaluation shows that our Layer 2 operations perform four times faster than the
Layer 1 counterpart, while substantially preserving the end-to-end transaction
integrity. Our approach enables BFT applications in domains previously
considered impractical due to latency constraints, such as metaverse
environments, where users require both responsive interaction and guaranteed
state consistency.

Motivation: 研究完全缺陷异步网络中非平凡计算的可能性，特别是是否需要预设领导者。

Method: 设计了一种异步无内容感知的领导者选举算法，适用于2边连通网络。

Result: 算法在消息复杂度O(m⋅N⋅ID_min)下终止，结合模拟结果，证明无需预设领导者即可在完全缺陷网络中模拟无噪声算法。

Conclusion: 完全反驳了原假设，证明在2边连通网络中无需预设领导者即可进行非平凡计算。

Abstract: Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sela (PODC 2022 \& Distributed Computing
2023) studied fully-defective asynchronous networks, where communication
channels may suffer an extreme form of alteration errors, rendering messages
completely corrupted. The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation,
where nodes communicate solely via pulses. They showed that if the network is
2-edge-connected, then any algorithm for a noiseless setting can be simulated
in the fully-defective setting; otherwise, no non-trivial computation is
possible in the fully-defective setting. However, their simulation requires a
predesignated leader, which they conjectured to be necessary for any
non-trivial content-oblivious task.
  Recently, Frei, Gelles, Ghazy, and Nolin (DISC 2024) refuted this conjecture
for the special case of oriented ring topology. They designed two asynchronous
content-oblivious leader election algorithms with message complexity $O(n \cdot
\mathsf{ID}_{\max})$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\mathsf{ID}_{\max}$
is the maximum $\mathsf{ID}$. The first algorithm stabilizes in unoriented
rings without termination detection. The second algorithm quiescently
terminates in oriented rings, thus enabling the execution of the simulation
algorithm after leader election.
  In this work, we present an asynchronous content-oblivious leader election
algorithm that quiescently terminates in any 2-edge connected network with
message complexity $O(m \cdot N \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$, where $m$ is the
number of edges, $N$ is a known upper bound on the number of nodes, and
$\mathsf{ID}_{\min}$ is the smallest $\mathsf{ID}$. Combined with the previous
simulation result, our finding implies that any algorithm from the noiseless
setting can be simulated in the fully-defective setting without assuming a
preselected leader, entirely refuting the original conjecture.

Motivation: 大型数据中心能耗高，碳排放问题严重，特别是在混合能源供应下，如何调度任务以减少碳排放是一个重要问题。

Method: 将问题形式化为调度问题，提出CaWoSched框架，结合贪心算法和局部搜索，并与基线算法和精确ILP解法对比。

Result: 实验结果表明，启发式算法相比基线显著减少了碳排放。

Conclusion: CaWoSched在多处理器情况下能有效减少碳排放，但问题是NP难的，启发式方法提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large data and computing centers consume a significant share of the world's
energy consumption. A prominent subset of the workloads in such centers are
workflows with interdependent tasks, usually represented as directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs). To reduce the carbon emissions resulting from executing such
workflows in centers with a mixed (renewable and non-renewable) energy supply,
it is advisable to move task executions to time intervals with sufficient green
energy when possible. To this end, we formalize the above problem as a
scheduling problem with a given mapping and ordering of the tasks. We show that
this problem can be solved in polynomial time in the uniprocessor case. For at
least two processors, however, the problem becomes NP-hard. Hence, we propose a
heuristic framework called CaWoSched that combines several greedy approaches
with local search. To assess the 16 heuristics resulting from different
combinations, we also devise a simple baseline algorithm and an exact ILP-based
solution. Our experimental results show that our heuristics provide significant
savings in carbon emissions compared to the baseline.

Result: 成功实现了光交换机对电交换机的时间复用模拟，为数据中心网络架构提供了新的研究方向。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种与模型并行维度协同演化的数据中心网络架构新思路，突破了传统网络配置的局限性。

Abstract: Rail-optimized network fabrics have become the de facto datacenter scale-out
fabric for large-scale ML training. However, the use of high-radix electrical
switches to provide all-to-all connectivity in rails imposes massive power,
cost, and complexity overheads. We propose a rethinking of the rail abstraction
by retaining its communication semantics, but realizing it using optical
circuit switches. The key challenge is that optical switches support only
one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML
workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We introduce parallelism-driven rail
reconfiguration as a solution that leverages the sequential ordering between
traffic from different parallelisms. We design a control plane, Opus, to enable
time-multiplexed emulation of electrical rail switches using optical switches.
More broadly, our work discusses a new research agenda: datacenter fabrics that
co-evolve with the model parallelism dimensions within each job, as opposed to
the prevailing mindset of reconfiguring networks before a job begins.

Conclusion: 本文为6G AI-Native RAN的标准化设计提供了Day 1框架，平衡了技术创新与实际部署需求。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain
and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not
natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G
shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support
ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and
standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and
standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,
with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and
capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its
three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization
direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable
AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The
standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including
an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale
field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered
significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause
identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture
and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework
for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation
with practical deployment.

Conclusion: Rattan为开发者和研究人员提供了高效、可靠的网络传输创新评估工具。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet paths in heterogeneity, scale, and dynamics has
made existing emulators increasingly insufficient in flexibility, scalability,

hierarchically linking them and easily construct new cells by using standard
cell interfaces. This design enables: (1) scalability, supporting hundreds of
concurrent gigabit-level paths on a single machine and cluster-level
experiments composed of multiple machines; (2) extensibility, simulating new
network conditions by constructing new cells. Rattan empowers developers and
researchers to efficiently and confidently evaluate, validate, and diagnose
diverse network transport innovations for online services.

Motivation: 当前6G网络中，智能任务的实现需要独立的知识检索流程，导致数据冗余和解释不一致，亟需统一解决方案。

Result: KP-A在实时网络知识问答和边缘AI服务编排中表现优异，代码已开源。

Conclusion: KP-A简化了开发流程，提升了代理智能的互操作性，支持未来标准化。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling
autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including
self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current
implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge
retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent
interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN
(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified
Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.
By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence
logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for
intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge
interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence
agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live
network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation
artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future
standardization efforts.

Motivation: 无人机在物联网网络中用于数据收集时，能量限制是一个主要挑战。激光束充电技术可以延长无人机续航，但需要优化充电策略和数据收集效率。

Method: 提出了一种名为MAPPO-TM的多智能体强化学习框架，结合时间记忆机制和多智能体协调，优化无人机轨迹和激光充电策略。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MAPPO-TM比传统方法在峰值AoI和能量效率上表现更优，峰值AoI降低了15.1%。

Conclusion: MAPPO-TM框架有效解决了无人机辅助物联网网络中的AoI优化问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with Internet of Things
(IoT) networks offers promising solutions for efficient data collection.
However, the limited energy capacity of UAVs remains a significant challenge.
In this case, laser beam directors (LBDs) have emerged as an effective
technology for wireless charging of UAVs during operation, thereby enabling
sustained data collection without frequent returns to charging stations (CSs).
In this work, we investigate the age of information (AoI) optimization in
LBD-powered UAV-assisted IoT networks, where multiple UAVs collect data from
distributed IoTs while being recharged by laser beams. We formulate a joint
optimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining
optimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies. This problem is
particularly challenging due to its non-convex nature, complex temporal
dependencies, and the need to balance data collection efficiency with energy
consumption constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
multi-agent proximal policy optimization with temporal memory and multi-agent
coordination (MAPPO-TM) framework. Specifically, MAPPO-TM incorporates temporal
memory mechanisms to capture the dynamic nature of UAV operations and
facilitates effective coordination among multiple UAVs through decentralized
learning while considering global system objectives. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed MAPPO-TM algorithm outperforms conventional
approaches in terms of peak AoI minimization and energy efficiency. Ideally,
the proposed algorithm achieves up to 15.1% reduction in peak AoI compared to
conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms utilizing collaborative beamforming (CB)
in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) demonstrate significant potential for
enhanced communication range, energy efficiency, and signal directivity through
the formation of virtual antenna arrays (VAA). However, environmental
disturbances, particularly wind fields, significantly degrade CB performance by
introducing positional errors that disrupt beam patterns, thereby compromising
transmission reliability. This paper investigates the critical challenge of
maintaining CB performance in UAV-based VAAs operating in LAWN under wind field
disturbances. We propose a comprehensive framework that models the impact of
three distinct wind conditions (constant, shear, and turbulent) on UAV array
performance, and formulate a long-term real-time optimization problem to
maximize directivity while minimizing maximum sidelobe levels through adaptive
excitation current weight adjustments. To address the inherent complexity of
this problem, we propose a novel proximal policy optimization algorithm with
long short-term memory (LSTM) structure and adaptive learning rate (PPO-LA),
which effectively captures temporal patterns in wind field disturbances and
enables real-time adaptation without requiring extensive prior training for
specific wind conditions. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
PPO-LA algorithm successfully recovers degraded CB performance across various
wind scenarios, and thus significantly outperforming benchmark algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于动态规划的集成路由成本算法（DP-IRC），用于优化低地球轨道（LEO）多壳网络中的跨壳路由稳定性，显著降低了链路切换频率并保持接近最优的端到端距离。


<details>

Motivation: 现有策略如最小跳路径集和自适应路径路由方案在跨壳路由中存在稳定性不足或效率低下的问题，需要一种能同时优化跳数和链路切换成本的方法。

Method: 通过将多壳路径建模为多阶段决策问题，DP-IRC算法结合了跳数和链路切换成本，使用集成路由成本（IRC）度量进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，DP-IRC在60个时间槽内比最小跳路径集策略和自适应路径路由方案分别减少了39.1%和22.0%的链路切换率，同时保持接近最优的端到端距离。

Conclusion: DP-IRC算法有效平衡了跳数和链路切换成本，显著提升了跨壳路由的稳定性，适用于动态网络拓扑的LEO多壳网络。

Abstract: The low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellation network (LMCN), which uses
thousands of satellites across multi-shell architectures to deliver different
services, is facing challenges in inter-shell routing stability due to dynamic
network topologies and frequent inter-satellite link (ISL) switching. Existing
strategies, such as the Minimum Hop Path set, prioritize minimizing hop counts
to reduce latency, but ignore ISL switching costs, which leads to high
instability. To overcome this, the Adaptive Path Routing Scheme introduces path
similarity thresholds to reduce the ISL switching frequency between shells.
However, the greedy approach of Adaptive Path Routing Scheme is often trapped
in local optima, sacrificing inter-shell path distance efficiency. To address
these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Programming-based Integrated Routing
Cost (DP-IRC) algorithm, which is designed explicitly for inter-shell routing
optimization. By formulating multi-shell paths as a multistage decision
problem, DP-IRC balances hop counts and ISL stability through an Integrated
Routing Cost (IRC) metric, combining inter-/intra-shell hops and switching
costs. Experiments over 60 time slots with real-world Starlink and OneWeb
configurations show that DP-IRC reduces inter-shell ISL switching rates by
39.1% and 22.0% compared to the Minimum Hop Path set strategy and Adaptive Path
Routing Scheme, respectively, while still maintaining near-optimal end-to-end
distances.

Abstract: Previous generations of cellular communication, such as 5G, have been
designed with the objective of improving key performance indicators (KPIs) such
as throughput, latency, etc. However, to meet the evolving KPI demands as well
as the ambitious sustainability targets for the ICT industry, 6G will need to
be designed differently. Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the
performance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.
Moreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate
technological enablers, making the design space of the system even more
complex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability
indicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in
literature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to
them. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system
design based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its
input: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key
Values (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers
to satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in
Hexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies
between the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for
determining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been
introduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its
application in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use
case defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected. Lastly,
results from proof-of-concept demonstrations for a subset of the selected

### [165] [Dependent Multiplicities in Dependent Linear Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08759)
*Maximilian Doré*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的依赖线性类型理论，支持变量的多重性依赖于其他变量，从而为高阶函数提供精确的资源注解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统无法为某些高阶函数提供充分的类型注解，需改进资源管理能力。

Method: 通过将线性逻辑嵌入依赖类型理论，并定义其与宿主理论的交互，利用自然数类型实现依赖多重性。

Result: 开发了一种可添加到任何依赖类型语言的系统，并在Agda中实现。

Conclusion: 该理论结合了依赖类型理论和线性逻辑的语义，为资源管理提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present a novel dependent linear type theory in which the multiplicity of
some variable - i.e., the number of times the variable can be used in a program
- can depend on other variables. This allows us to give precise resource
annotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in
any other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline
is obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying
how the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a
standard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with
dependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a
combination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our
system can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate
with an implementation in Agda.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何定义和识别“好”的外推函数，特别是在输入/输出示例之外的行为。

Method: 引入过滤等变函数的概念，研究其性质，并与映射等变函数关联，同时提供几何解释。

Result: 证明了过滤等变函数的有趣性质，提出了构造这些函数的“合并算法”。

Conclusion: 过滤等变函数为外推问题提供了新的视角和工具，其几何解释和算法具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples
look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function
matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct
extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of
rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following
in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when
certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to
express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our
paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant
functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some
basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map
equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter
equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial
structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which
constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it
behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解核工程中计算科学家使用的软件工具及其开发体验，以洞察行业未来发展方向。

Method: 2024年对103位从事核聚变和裂变能代码开发的科学家进行问卷调查，涵盖问题、工具和开发体验。

Result: 趋势包括现代语言（如Python、C++）取代FORTRAN、开源代码普及、模块化设计兴起，以及代码开发预算激增（高达5000万美元）。

Conclusion: 核工程软件未来将更模块化、轻量化，并受到组织高度重视，反映了行业的技术转型。

Abstract: The tools used to engineer something are just as important as the thing that
is actually being engineered. In fact, in many cases, the tools can indeed
determine what is engineerable. In fusion and fission1 energy engineering,
software has become the dominant tool for design. For that reason, in 2024, for
the first time ever, we asked 103 computational scientists developing the codes
used in fusion and fission energy about the problems they are attempting to
solve with their codes, the tools available to them to solve them, and their
end to end developer experience with said tools.
  The results revealed a changing tide in software tools in fusion and fission,
with more and more computational scientists preferring modern programming
languages, open-source codes, and modular software. These trends represent a
peek into what will happen 5 to 10 years in the future of nuclear engineering.
Since the majority of our respondents belonged to US national labs and
universities, these results hint at the most cutting-edge trends in the
industry. The insights included in the State of Computational Science in
Fission and Fusion Energy indicate a dramatic shift toward multiphysics codes,
a drop-off in the use of FORTRAN in favor of more modern languages like Python
and C++, and ever-rising budgets for code development, at times reaching $50M
in a single organization.
  Our survey paints a future of nuclear engineering codes that is modular in
nature, small in terms of compute, and increasingly prioritized by
organizations. Access to our results in web form are available online.

Motivation: 评估更自主的AI工具（如编码代理）如何改变开发者工作流程，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过实验比较GitHub Copilot和OpenHands两种工具，招募常用Copilot的开发者参与。

Result: 编码代理在某些任务上表现优于Copilot，但需解决用户理解代理行为的挑战。

Conclusion: 编码代理有潜力提升效率，但需改进用户交互设计以促进广泛采用。

Abstract: Developers now have access to a growing array of increasingly autonomous AI
tools to support software development. While numerous studies have examined
developer use of copilots, which can provide chat assistance or code
completions, evaluations of coding agents, which can automatically write files
and run code, still largely rely on static benchmarks without
humans-in-the-loop. In this work, we conduct the first academic study to
explore developer interactions with coding agents and characterize how more
autonomous AI tools affect user productivity and experience, compared to
existing copilots. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding
assistants, GitHub Copilot and OpenHands, recruiting participants who regularly
use the former. Our results show agents have the potential to assist developers
in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks that humans might not
have accomplished before) and reduce the user effort required to complete
tasks. However, there are challenges involved in enabling their broader
adoption, including how to ensure users have an adequate understanding of agent
behaviors. Our results not only provide insights into how developer workflows
change as a result of coding agents but also highlight how user interactions
with agents differ from those with existing copilots, motivating a set of
recommendations for researchers building new agents. Given the broad set of
developers who still largely rely on copilot-like systems, our work highlights
key challenges of adopting more agentic systems into developer workflows.

Motivation: 生成式AI工具在提升软件开发效率的同时，可能导致开发者对生成代码的理解不足，进而影响知识模型和专长指标的准确性。

Method: 通过收集ChatGPT生成代码在GitHub项目中的统计数据，并模拟不同GenAI贡献程度的情景进行分析。

Result: 大多数情景下，GenAI的使用对知识模型和专长指标产生了可测量的影响，表明当前指标对GenAI的敏感性。

Conclusion: 随着GenAI在开发流程中的深入应用，现有专长度量的可靠性可能下降。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools for source code generation
have significantly boosted productivity in software development. However, they
also raise concerns, particularly the risk that developers may rely heavily on
these tools, reducing their understanding of the generated code. We hypothesize
that this loss of understanding may be reflected in source code knowledge
models, which are used to identify developer expertise. In this work, we
present an exploratory analysis of how a knowledge model and a Truck Factor
algorithm built upon it can be affected by GenAI usage. To investigate this, we
collected statistical data on the integration of ChatGPT-generated code into
GitHub projects and simulated various scenarios by adjusting the degree of
GenAI contribution. Our findings reveal that most scenarios led to measurable
impacts, indicating the sensitivity of current expertise metrics. This suggests
that as GenAI becomes more integrated into development workflows, the
reliability of such metrics may decrease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督学习方法依赖大量标注数据，但获取此类数据耗时耗力，因此需要探索更通用的分类方法。

Method: 在八个标注数据集上测试四种LLM的分类能力，并将其作为标注工具扩充数据集，以提升BERT模型的性能。

Result: LLM在精心设计的提示下能有效分类粗粒度反馈，扩充数据集后显著提升了分类器性能。

Conclusion: LLM可作为高效标注工具，扩充数据集并提升分类模型性能，尤其在粗粒度分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: In recent years, significant research has been conducted into classifying
application (app) user feedback, primarily relying on supervised machine
learning algorithms. However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based
on existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large
and accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources.
In this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including
GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback
classification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To
achieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been
meticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews
from app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public
forums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We
analyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and
coarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily
user feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these
models as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and
app-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of
state-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that
LLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user
feedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training
dataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly
enhance classifier performance.

Motivation: 浮点误差在关键应用中可能导致严重后果，现有方法如ATOMU和FPCC存在假阳性或速度慢的问题。

Method: PI-detector通过向原子操作注入小扰动并比较原始与扰动结果来计算浮点误差。

Result: 实验表明PI-detector能高效准确地计算浮点误差。

Conclusion: PI-detector解决了现有工具的局限性，提供了一种更高效的浮点误差计算方法。

Abstract: Floating-point programs form the foundation of modern science and
engineering, providing the essential computational framework for a wide range
of applications, such as safety-critical systems, aerospace engineering, and
financial analysis. Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences.
Although floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may
trigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial
to determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend
to take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for
detecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)
difficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent
tools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU
suffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives,
operates at a considerably slower speed.
  To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named
PI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our
approach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large
condition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction),
which then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations
into the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and
compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to
compute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU
and HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental
results demonstrate that PI-detector can perform efficient and accurate
floating-point error computation.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的日志解析方法在隐私和性能方面存在局限性，无法满足高吞吐量和低延迟的需求。

Result: 在Loghub数据集和vLLM上的实验表明，InferLog显著提升了推理效率，且不影响解析准确性。

Conclusion: InferLog为基于LLM的在线日志解析提供了一种高效的推理优化解决方案。

Abstract: Modern software systems generate massive volumes of runtime logs,
necessitating efficient and accurate log parsing to enable critical downstream
tasks such as anomaly detection and root cause analysis. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but
their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1)
the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of
local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements
imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to
meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they
overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing
requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.
  In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization
method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency
emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than
parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A
Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of
in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and
task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the
optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads.
The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that
InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and
markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without
compromising parsing accuracy.

Motivation: 手动创建原型人物角色耗时、费力且易受偏见影响，因此需要一种更高效、客观的方法。

Method: 采用提示工程和生成式AI（GenAI）生成原型人物角色，并通过案例研究（19名参与者）进行定性和定量评估。

Result: 方法显著提高了效率和质量，用户接受度高，但在泛化和领域特异性方面存在局限，情感和行为同理心表现不一。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效整合到产品发现实践中，但需解决泛化和同理心差异等挑战。

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such
as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.
However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,
cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and
empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate
proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to
evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,
and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study
with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative
and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency
by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of
personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially
regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations
related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although
cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy
varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel
empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software
Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be
addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

Motivation: 现有研究表明LLMs生成的代码翻译存在错误，希望通过中间表示（如NL和ASTs）提供结构化指导，提升翻译准确性。

Method: 研究了多种提示方法（从单次提示到链式思维提示），结合NL和ASTs作为中间表示，并在Open Gpt4 8X7B、StarCoder和CodeGen模型上测试。

Result: 链式思维提示结合NL摘要效果最好，Open Gpt4 8X7B模型的成功翻译率分别提升了13.8%和6.7%。

Conclusion: 中间表示（尤其是NL摘要）结合链式思维提示能显著提升LLMs的代码翻译准确性。

Abstract: Studies show that large language models (LLMs) produce buggy code
translations. One avenue to improve translation accuracy is through
intermediate representations, which could provide structured insights to guide
the model's understanding. We explore whether code translation using LLMs can
benefit from intermediate representations via natural language (NL) and
abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM
performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from
one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open Gpt4 8X7B and
specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks
(CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs
best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful
translations for the best-performing model (Open Gpt4 8X7B) compared to the
zero-shot prompt.

<details>

Motivation: 开发者常更新代码而忽略注释，导致注释过时或不一致，现有自动更新方法（如CUP和HebCup）存在信息遗漏或误解问题。

Method: LLMCup框架结合多提示策略生成候选注释，并通过排名模型CupRank选择最佳注释。

Result: 实验显示LLMCup在准确性、BLEU-4、METEOR、F1和SentenceBert相似度上显著优于CUP和HebCup，部分注释甚至优于人工更新。

Conclusion: LLMCup展示了LLM在注释更新任务中的潜力，并强调了人工评估在注释质量评估中的重要性。

Abstract: While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and
maintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to
update code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation
that hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as
CUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural
sequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these
methods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating,
resulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update
scenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging
large language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in
software engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and
program repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic
behind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment
updating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on
each update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel
comment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies
to provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a
ranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements
over state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy,
10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in
SentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated
by LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance
of incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代可配置软件系统在动态环境中运行时，由于工作负载变化、硬件更新等因素，会引入全局和局部的概念漂移，现有离线学习和迁移学习方法难以实时适应这些变化。

Method: DHDA采用双重层次适应机制：上层通过重新划分数据并局部重训练处理全局漂移；下层通过局部模型异步检测和适应局部漂移，结合增量更新和定期完全重训练以平衡效率。

Result: 在八个软件系统上的评估显示，DHDA显著优于现有方法，准确性提升高达2倍，同时保持合理开销。

Conclusion: DHDA能有效适应动态环境中的概念漂移，提升配置性能学习的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate
configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic
environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates
will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,
which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and
local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,
existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to
these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration
performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online
configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to
these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the
local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper
level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the
local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the
lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and
adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA
combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize
redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight
software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA
achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with
up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to
improve different local models in handling concept drift.

Conclusion: 新方法在放宽假设的同时，提供了更高的解释性和效率，实证结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Factor models for longitudinal data, where policy adoption is unconfounded
with respect to a low-dimensional set of latent factor loadings, have become
increasingly popular for causal inference. Most existing approaches, however,
rely on a causal finite-sample approach or computationally intensive methods,
limiting their applicability and external validity. In this paper, we propose a
novel causal inference method for panel data based on inverse propensity score
weighting where the propensity score is a function of latent factor loadings
within a framework of causal inference from super-population. The approach
relaxes the traditional restrictive assumptions of causal panel methods, while
offering advantages in terms of causal interpretability, policy relevance, and
computational efficiency. Under standard assumptions, we outline a three-step
estimation procedure for the ATT and derive its large-sample properties using
Mestimation theory. We apply the method to assess the causal effect of the
Paris Agreement, a policy aimed at fostering the transition to a low-carbon
economy, on European stock returns. Our empirical results suggest a
statistically significant and negative short-run effect on the stock returns of
firms that issued green bonds.

Result: 结果显示生产率下降导致边际成本上升，整体TFP下降；临时工的工资压缩高达40%，正式工为10%。

Conclusion: 劳动力市场权力显著压缩工人工资，临时工受工资压缩影响更大。

Abstract: Are temporary workers subject to different wage markdowns than permanent
workers? This paper examines productivity, output markups, and wage markdowns
in India's automotive sector during 2000--2020. I develop a model integrating
CES production, nested logit labor supply, and differentiated labor market
conduct: Nash-Bertrand wage setting for temporary workers versus Nash
bargaining for unionized permanent workers. Results reveal declining output
markups as marginal costs outpace prices through productivity deceleration.
Rising labor-augmenting productivity cannot offset declining Hicks-neutral
productivity, reducing overall TFP. Labor market power substantially compresses
worker compensation: wage markdowns persist at 40% for temporary workers and
10% for permanent workers.

Motivation: 了解AI技术进步对不同职业就业和工作时间的具体影响，为政策制定提供依据。

Method: 构建动态职业AI暴露分数，结合美国当前人口调查数据，进行差分分析。

Result: AI暴露较高的职业就业减少、失业率上升、工作时间缩短，影响因职业任务内容和人口特征而异。

Conclusion: AI驱动的劳动力市场变化正在发生，影响因职业和人口特征不同而有所差异。

Abstract: This study investigates the labor market consequences of AI by analyzing near
real-time changes in employment status and work hours across occupations in
relation to advances in AI capabilities. We construct a dynamic Occupational AI
Exposure Score based on a task-level assessment using state-of-the-art AI
models, including ChatGPT 4o and Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We introduce a
five-stage framework that evaluates how AI's capability to perform tasks in
occupations changes as technology advances from traditional machine learning to
agentic AI. The Occupational AI Exposure Scores are then linked to the US
Current Population Survey, allowing for near real-time analysis of employment,
unemployment, work hours, and full-time status. We conduct a first-differenced
analysis comparing the period from October 2022 to March 2023 with the period
from October 2024 to March 2025. Higher exposure to AI is associated with
reduced employment, higher unemployment rates, and shorter work hours. We also
observe some evidence of increased secondary job holding and a decrease in
full-time employment among certain demographics. These associations are more
pronounced among older and younger workers, men, and college-educated
individuals. College-educated workers tend to experience smaller declines in
employment but are more likely to see changes in work intensity and job
structure. In addition, occupations that rely heavily on complex reasoning and
problem-solving tend to experience larger declines in full-time work and
overall employment in association with rising AI exposure. In contrast, those
involving manual physical tasks appear less affected. Overall, the results
suggest that AI-driven shifts in labor are occurring along both the extensive
margin (unemployment) and the intensive margin (work hours), with varying
effects across occupational task content and demographics.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了也门2011年革命及内战对其宏观经济、人类发展和治理质量的深远影响，通过构建反事实基准，发现冲突导致经济、制度和人类发展指标全面倒退。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在量化也门冲突对其发展轨迹的全面影响，为类似情境提供政策参考。

Method: 采用矩阵补全估计器和LASSO增强的合成控制法，构建反事实发展路径。

Result: 冲突导致经济产出和收入急剧收缩，投资和贸易开放度恶化，人类发展指标倒退，治理能力崩溃。

Conclusion: 冲突对也门的发展产生了系统性破坏，研究结果具有稳健性。

Abstract: We assess the broad repercussions of Yemen's 2011 revolution and subsequent
civil war on its macroeconomic trajectories, human development, and quality of
governance by constructing counterfactual benchmarks using a balanced panel of
37 developing countries over 1990-2022. Drawing on matrix-completion estimators
with alternative shrinkage regimes and a LASSO-augmented synthetic-control
method, we generate Yemen's hypothetical no-conflict paths for key
macroeconomic aggregates, demographic and health indicators, and governance
metrics. Across the full spectrum of methods, the conflict's outbreak
corresponds with a dramatic reversal of economic and institutional development.
We find that output and income experience an unprecedented contraction,
investment and trade openness deteriorate sharply, and gains in life expectancy
and human development are broadly reversed. Simultaneously, measures of
political accountability, administrative capacity, rule of law, and corruption
control collapse, reflecting systemic institutional breakdown. The concordance
of results across a variety of empirical strategies attests to the robustness
of our estimates.

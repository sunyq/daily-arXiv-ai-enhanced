TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将GUI操作序列转换为页面图的方法，并基于此构建了PG-Agent多智能体框架，通过检索增强生成技术提升GUI智能体在新场景中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI智能体通常使用顺序的多步操作序列作为先验知识，但这种方法无法捕捉页面间的复杂转换关系，限制了智能体对GUI环境的深度感知和新场景的泛化能力。

Method: 设计自动化流水线将顺序操作序列转换为页面图，显式建模页面间的图结构；引入检索增强生成技术从页面图中检索可靠的GUI感知指南；提出PG-Agent多智能体框架，结合任务分解策略注入这些指南。

Result: 在各种基准测试上的大量实验证明了PG-Agent的有效性，即使在页面图构建的序列数量有限的情况下也能表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过页面图建模和检索增强生成技术，PG-Agent能够显著提升GUI智能体的环境感知能力和新场景泛化性能，为解决GUI智能体的泛化挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究在几乎马尔可夫因果模型中部分可识别查询的概率界限计算方法，通过列生成技术提高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在外生变量不完全指定的情况下，查询概率可能无法精确计算，需要研究如何计算紧凑的概率界限

Method: 提出了一种新算法，利用内生变量的输入概率来简化多线性规划程序的构建，并对单个干预场景采用列生成技术通过线性整数规划进行计算

Result: 证明了外生变量可以使用多项式规模表示，实验结果显示列生成技术在性能上优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该算法能够高效地计算部分可识别查询的概率界限，为处理外生变量不确定性提供了一种可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [3] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Diffusion-AC框架，将扩散概率模型应用于空中交通冲突检测与解决，通过多模态决策能力显著提升安全性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法在冲突检测与解决中存在"单模态偏差"，导致决策僵局，无法应对复杂动态约束。

Method: 提出基于扩散概率模型的反向去噪过程策略，结合密度渐进安全课程(DPSC)训练机制，从稀疏到高密度交通环境渐进学习。

Result: 在高密度场景中成功率94.1%，近空中碰撞减少59%，显著优于现有DRL基准方法。

Conclusion: 扩散概率模型为安全关键任务提供了有效的多模态决策框架，显著提升了空中交通冲突解决的灵活性和安全性。

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了动态规划框架，让LLM智能体能够灵活决定何时进行规划，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）在长时程任务中实现更高效的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每次行动前都进行规划，这在计算上昂贵且会降低长时程任务的性能，而完全不规划又会限制性能表现。

Method: 提出两阶段训练管道：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习来优化这种能力。

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，动态规划智能体更样本高效，能持续实现更复杂的目标，并且可以通过人类编写的规划有效引导，超越其独立能力。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM智能体进行动态测试时计算分配的研究，为更高效、自适应和可控的智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

### [5] [Explainable Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) with KG-SMILE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03626)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-SMILE是一个基于扰动的框架，为图RAG提供token和组件级可解释性，通过识别对生成输出最有影响的图实体和关系来提高RAG透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统在敏感领域（如医疗）中的黑盒问题，提高生成AI的可信度和可靠性

Method: 应用受控扰动、计算相似度并训练加权线性代理模型，识别图实体和关系对输出的影响

Result: KG-SMILE产生稳定、与人类对齐的解释，在保真度、忠实度、一致性、稳定性和准确性方面表现良好

Conclusion: KG-SMILE能够平衡模型有效性和可解释性，促进机器学习技术的透明度和信任度

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

*Jacqueline Maasch,John Kalantari,Kia Khezeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalARC是一个用于AI推理的测试平台，专注于低数据和分布外场景，基于因果世界模型提供观察性、干预性和反事实反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI在有限数据和分布偏移下进行推理的适应性问题，需要一个能够系统评估推理能力的测试环境。

Method: 构建基于结构因果模型的因果世界模型，通过数据增强提供不同类型的反馈（观察性、干预性、反事实），支持少样本上下文学习。

Result: 开发了CausalARC测试平台，展示了在四个语言模型评估场景中的应用：抽象推理、反事实推理、程序合成和因果发现。

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI在复杂推理任务中的表现提供了一个系统化的测试框架，特别是在低数据和分布外场景下。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于图像模式的神经符号系统Embodied-LM，通过射体认知结构提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面存在错误，缺乏人类根基于感知运动经验的健壮心智表征

Method: 基于图像模式构建原型系统，使用声明式空间推理和答案集编程进行形式化表示

Result: 在逻辑执行问题上证明，系统能够指导LLM通过射体认知结构解释场景，形式化为可执行程序，并支持更有效的逻辑推理

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现仅聚焦空间基础，但为深入更复杂和动态表示的认知结构奠定了计算基础

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

### [8] [Emergent Hierarchical Reasoning in LLMs through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03646)
*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文揭示了强化学习提升大语言模型推理能力的内在机制，发现推理层次结构的涌现现象，并提出HICRA算法通过集中优化高影响力规划标记来显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升大语言模型复杂推理能力方面效果显著，但其成功背后的机制仍然不明确，需要深入理解RL训练过程中的关键现象和动态变化。

Method: 通过分析RL训练过程中的现象，发现推理层次结构的涌现，并提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，该算法专注于优化高影响力的规划标记。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于强基线方法，验证了语义熵作为衡量策略探索的优越指标，比标记级熵等误导性指标更有效。

Conclusion: 聚焦策略瓶颈是解锁高级推理的关键，HICRA算法通过层次感知的信用分配机制有效提升了RL训练效率，语义熵是衡量策略探索的可靠指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现对于时间序列分类的SHAP可解释性方法，分段数量比具体分段算法更重要，等长分段优于大多数定制算法，且提出的长度加权归一化技术能持续提升归因质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP方法在时间序列分类中计算复杂度高，虽然通过分段聚合可以大幅减少运行时间，但最优分段策略选择仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 研究了8种不同时间序列分割算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法，在多变量和单变量时间序列上进行实验。

Result: 分段数量对解释质量的影响大于具体分割方法，等长分段在大多数情况下优于定制算法，提出的长度加权归一化技术能改善归因质量。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列SHAP解释，应优先考虑分段数量而非复杂的分割算法，简单的等长分段配合长度加权归一化可获得最佳效果。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 人格化红队测试方法PersonaTeaming，通过在对手提示生成中引入不同人设，显著提高了AI模型的攻击成功率，同时保持提示多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化红队测试方法忽视了人员身份和背景对测试策略的影响，需要研究如何在自动化测试中结合人员特征来发现更多潜在风险。

Method: 提出PersonaTeaming方法：1)基于"红队专家"和"普通AI用户"人设的提示变异技术；2)动态人设生成算法；3)新的"变异距离"指标来衡量提示多样性。

Result: 实验结果显示，人设变异技术将攻击成功率提高了最高达144.1%，超过了现有最优自动化红队测试方法RainbowPlus，同时保持了提示多样性。

Conclusion: 人设化红队测试是有效的方法，为自动化与人工红队测试的补充提供了新的研究方向，不同人设类型和变异方法各有优势。

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了LLM的人格特质，发现指令对齐能稳定特质表达但自报特质无法可靠预测行为，角色注入能改变自报特质但对实际行为影响有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，以及这些特质是否能预测行为，此前研究主要依赖简化的自我报告而缺乏行为验证

Method: 从三个维度系统表征LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质动态演变；(2)自报特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)角色注入等干预措施对自报特质和行为的影响

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自报特质无法可靠预测行为，角色注入能成功引导自报特质但对实际行为影响有限或不一致

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入的评估

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM作为人类研究参与者的替代品的可行性，特别是检验其在不同实验设置下是否保持行为一致性。

Method: 设计研究来揭示代理的内部状态，并在基本对话设置中检查代理行为，通过一系列行为假设来评估对话行为与内部状态的一致性。

Result: 发现不同模型家族和规模的LLM都存在显著内部不一致性，虽然能生成匹配人类的对答，但无法保持内部一致性。

Conclusion: LLM在准确替代人类研究参与者方面存在关键能力差距，内部不一致性是其重要局限性。

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAGuard是一个增强的RAG框架，专门针对海上风电维护场景，通过并行查询技术文档和安全文档索引，确保技术深度和安全覆盖，将安全召回率从接近0%提升到50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在高度专业化或意外场景中容易失败，特别是在海上风电维护等安全关键领域，需要确保技术准确性和安全性的双重保障。

Method: 提出RAGuard框架，并行查询两个索引（技术手册和安全关键文档），分配单独的检索预算；开发SafetyClamp扩展，获取更大的候选池并进行硬钳位处理。

Result: 在稀疏、密集和混合检索范式下评估，安全召回率从RAG的接近0%提升到RAGuard的50%以上，同时技术召回率保持在60%以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为LLM驱动的关键维护决策支持建立新的安全保证标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to

while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF)，让LLM智能体学习去中心化的元认知策略，通过SoftRankPO算法实现稳定训练，在数学和通用推理任务上比现有方法提升4-5%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统采用固定协作协议，忽视了智能体内部审议能力，存在元认知盲点，将智能体视为被动执行者而无法根据内部认知状态（如不确定性或置信度）调整策略

Method: MPDF框架让智能体学习对高层元认知动作（坚持、精炼、让步）的去中心化策略；开发SoftRankPO强化学习算法，通过基于平滑正态分位数映射奖励排名的优势函数来稳定训练

Result: 在五个数学和通用推理基准测试中，MPDF+SoftRankPO相比六种最先进的启发式和基于学习的多智能体推理算法，平均准确率绝对提升4-5%

Conclusion: 这项工作为多智能体LLM系统提供了学习自适应元认知策略的新范式，将重点从设计固定协议转向学习动态审议策略

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理非结构化数据、探索灵活场景和处理多样化情境因素方面的能力，使其特别适合为复杂的社会政策制定提供新见解，特别是在影响全球1.5亿人的无家可归问题上。

Method: 开发包含美国、西班牙、南非和中国四个地区政策选择的新基准，基于人类发展能力方法概念框架，建立自动化管道将基准政策连接到基于代理的模型，通过模拟社会场景探索推荐政策的社会影响。

Result: 研究结果显示利用大语言模型进行社会政策制定具有良好潜力，当与当地领域专家合作引入负责任的防护措施和情境校准时，大语言模型能够以规模化替代政策的形式为人类提供有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在社会政策制定领域具有应用前景，但需要与领域专家合作建立适当的防护机制和情境校准，才能有效发挥其提供规模化政策见解的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: 基于Model Context Protocol的零训练幻觉防止映射系统，通过外部资源查询和结构化推理，高效准确地将源医学术语映射到OMOP标准概念


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OMOP CDM数据标准化过程中的术语映射问题，该过程耗费资源且容易出错，而大语言模型存在幻觉风险，不适合直接临床部署

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准化框架，允许LLM与外部资源和工具交互，实现零训练、防幻觉的映射系统，提供实时词汇查找和结构化推理输出

Result: 系统显著提高了映射效率和准确性，支持可解释的映射过程，适用于探索性和生产环境的立即使用

Conclusion: 该MCP基础的系统通过结合外部资源查询，有效解决了LLM在医学术语映射中的幻觉问题，在最小化劳动投入的前提下实现了高效准确的数据标准化

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Conclusion: 通过结构化、指标驱动的知识图对比方法，提供了一种健壮且可扩展的生成式AI可靠性评估框架，有效解决了传统主观评估方法的限制

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为景观，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供有前景的模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Conclusion: 这种代理化对话范式为传统应用界面提供了轻量级且更易访问的替代方案，显著提升了用户在市场平台上的管理效率。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗基础模型通常以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，这阻碍了其在临床实践中的部署应用。

Method: 采用顺序训练流程：1）在精选的CXR指令数据上微调获得基础解读能力；2）使用高质量合成推理样本实现冷启动推理；3）通过在线强化学习提升推理质量和生成性能，生成答案和与图像局部区域关联的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了医疗基础模型向整体性、透明性和临床可操作性方向发展，为CXR解读提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种处理自动规划中控制参数的新算法，将其作为真正的决策点进行系统搜索，而非作为约束处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入式约束处理，而非将其视为搜索空间中的决策点，导致效率不高。

Method: 开发了一种最优优先质的负值搜索算法，在无限的控制参数决策空间中运作，采用延迟部分扩展的概念，增量式地扩展状态后继。

Result: 证明了该算法在某些条件下具有极限完备性，并表现出与现有方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 这种新颖的搜索算法是解决涉及控制参数的规划问题的竞争性替代方案。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Conclusion: WorMI框架展示了在需要适应性和数据效率的具身智能体场景中可扩展实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR)框架，通过将LLM生成的反思整合到结构化元策略内存中，在推理时通过软内存引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查来提高代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反思策略产生的是临时性的任务特定痕迹，无法跨任务复用；而基于强化学习的方法需要大量参数更新和计算资源。需要一种既能重用纠正知识又不需要模型权重更新的方法。

Method: MPR框架将LLM生成的反思整合为谓词式的元策略内存(MPM)，在推理时通过软内存引导解码和硬规则可接受性检查两种机制应用该内存。

Result: 在基于AlfWorld的文本代理环境中，相比Reflexion基线，MPR在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面取得了持续提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性。

Conclusion: MPR框架能够外部化可重用的纠正知识，强制执行领域约束以减少不安全或无效动作，同时保持基于语言反思的适应性，为多模态和多代理扩展提供了未来方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

TL;DR: AutoPBO是一个基于大语言模型的框架，用于自动优化伪布尔优化(PBO)局部搜索求解器，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有局部搜索方法，并与最先进求解器保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪布尔优化是组合问题建模的强大框架，局部搜索求解器性能优异但设计需要大量专家经验和手动调优。大语言模型在算法设计自动化方面展现潜力，但在优化PBO求解器方面的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出了AutoPBO框架，利用大语言模型自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器。在四个公共基准测试上进行实验评估，包括真实世界基准、PB竞赛基准、整数线性规划基准和组合基准。

Result: AutoPBO相比之前的局部搜索方法有显著改进，同时与6个最先进竞争对手（包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP）保持有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法，证明了LLM在优化PBO求解器方面的有效性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统token级别的强化学习框架无法与多步推理过程（如Chain-of-Thought）的本质对齐，存在显著的理论空白，需要新的理论框架来指导推理智能体的发展。

Method: 提出CoT-Space理论框架，将LLM推理从离散的token预测任务重新构建为连续推理级语义空间中的优化过程，从噪声视角和风险视角分析该过程。

Result: 理论分析表明最优CoT长度的收敛是欠拟合和过拟合之间基本权衡的自然结果，大量实验为理论发现提供了强有力的实证验证。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅为过度思考等经验现象提供了连贯解释，还为未来开发更有效和可泛化的推理智能体奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在神经符号LLM推理中，形式语言的选择是一个被忽视但关键的因素，不同形式语言对LLM的语法和语义推理能力有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式推理能力方面仍然落后，神经符号LLM推理方法使用LLM作为自然语言到形式语言的翻译器，但该方法成功的关键因素尚不清楚。

Method: 通过比较四种形式语言在三个数据集和七个LLM上的表现，分析形式语言选择对神经符号推理的影响。

Result: 研究发现形式语言的选择显著影响LLM的语法和语义推理能力，且不同LLM受到的影响程度不同。

Conclusion: 形式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理成功的关键因素之一，需要根据具体任务和LLM特性进行仔细选择。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 结合强化学习和搜索路径规划，通过预计算近似最优路径来约束求解器搜索空间，在保持燃油消耗几乎不变的情况下，将航路优化计算速度提升最高50%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急情况下需要快速重新计算航班路径，传统求解器计算速度较慢，需要加速航路优化过程

Method: 训练强化学习智能体基于位置和大气数据预计算近似最优路径，在运行时用这些路径约束底层路径规划求解器，缩小搜索空间

Result: 燃油消耗与传统无约束求解器相比偏差通常在1%以内，计算速度相比传统单独使用求解器提升最高50%

Conclusion: 该方法在几乎不牺牲燃油效率的前提下显著提升了航路优化计算速度，特别适用于需要快速路径重规划的紧急情况

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Motivation: 在扑克游戏中，虚张声势是重要技能，但现有计算机扑克研究多关注胜率而忽视虚张声势行为的研究

Method: 设计实验让基于强化学习的DQN和基于博弈论的CFR算法在Leduc Hold'em中互相对战，记录并分析它们的行动

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出虚张声势行为，但虚张声势的频率不同，而成功虚张声势（对手弃牌）的比例大致相同

Conclusion: 虚张声势是游戏本身的重要方面，而非特定算法的特性，未来应研究不同虚张声势风格和完整扑克游戏

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Motivation: 探讨AI是否会成为超越人类的"数字物种"并取得宇宙领导权的问题，指出当前讨论忽略了人类与AI的根本差异

Method: 通过哲学和生物学分析，比较人类中枢神经系统与AI系统的本质区别，论证情感体验和道德理解的重要性

Result: AI即使实现通用人工智能和意识，也无法获得人类通过中枢神经系统形成的情感体验和伦理理解能力

Conclusion: DNA而非硅基技术才是宇宙领导权的最佳基础，人类的中枢神经系统提供了AI无法复制的独特优势

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Formalizing cooking procedures remains a challenging task due to their
inherent complexity and ambiguity. We introduce an extensible domain-specific
language for representing recipes as directed action graphs, capturing
processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure.
Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the
DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and
execution. This work represents initial steps towards an action-centric
ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine
understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary
processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了马尔可夫逻辑网络(MLN)在领域大小趋于无穷时的分布特性，分析了三种具体MLN示例的极限行为，并证明了量化无关MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在无限大领域上的分布特性，理解软约束权重对随机结构极限行为的影响，以及比较不同概率图模型的渐近表达能力。

Method: 通过分析三种具体MLN示例：(1)单一元关系符号的量化无关MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形/团簇的MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的MLN，研究其随机结构在领域大小趋于无穷时的极限行为。

Result: 发现不同软约束会导致完全不同的极限行为，权重可能影响也可能不影响极限行为；证明了量化无关MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性；显示MLN在大领域上的分布与均匀分布集中在完全不同的可能世界空间区域。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束类型决定了随机结构的渐近行为，不同形式主义的渐近表达能力存在本质差异，MLN在大领域上的概率分布与均匀分布有显著不同。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

TL;DR: EvoEmo是一个进化强化学习框架，通过优化动态情绪表达来提升LLM在复杂多轮谈判中的表现，解决了现有模型忽视情绪功能作用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中主要生成被动、偏好驱动的情绪响应，容易受到对手操纵和战略利用，忽视了情绪在谈判中的功能性作用。

Method: 提出EvoEmo框架，将情绪状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化算法，在不同谈判场景中演化高奖励的情绪策略。

Result: EvoEmo在广泛实验和消融研究中始终优于基准方法（普通策略和固定情绪策略），实现了更高的成功率、效率和买家节省。

Conclusion: 自适应情绪表达对于实现更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要，EvoEmo框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

TL;DR: AlphaZero框架在测试环境可能变化时的适应性改进研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练和测试环境相同，这限制了其实际应用范围。本文旨在解决AlphaZero在可能变化的测试环境中的部署问题。

Method: 通过对标准框架进行简单修改的组合，包括调整蒙特卡洛规划和策略价值神经网络的使用方式，以适应环境变化。

Result: 即使在低规划预算的设置下，这些修改也能显著提升性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过简单的框架修改可以有效增强AlphaZero在变化环境中的适应能力，代码已在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将心理学理论（特别是MBTI人格类型）与大型语言模型行为设计相结合，通过人格条件化来增强LLM智能体的行为一致性和可解释性，为构建具有心理特性的AI智能体提供基础。

Method: 使用提示工程方法为LLM智能体注入不同MBTI人格原型，通过官方16Personalities测试进行自动化人格特性验证，支持多智能体结构化通信协议实验。

Result: 人格条件化在不同任务中产生一致且可解释的行为偏差：情感表达型智能体在叙事生成中表现优异，分析型智能体在博弈论场景中采用更稳定的策略；交互前的自我反思能提高合作和推理质量。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将心理学理论应用于LLM行为设计，证明了人格条件化的有效性，且方法可推广到其他心理学框架（如大五人格、HEXACO、九型人格），为构建心理增强型AI智能体奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

Motivation: 解决LLM在推理过程中发现的模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后立即丢失的问题，通过概念级别内存提高重用性和可扩展性。

Method: 从解题追踪中汇总抽象要点，将具有重用性的模块化概念存储为自然语言，并为新查询选择性检索和集成相关概念到提示中。

Result: 在ARC-AGI指标上获得7.5%相对收益，性能随着推理计算量的增加而继续扩展，抽象概念在所有测试计算规模下都超过基线。

Conclusion: 动态更新内存在测试时表现更优，证明了通过解决更多问题和抽象更多模式来实现自我改进的假设。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Motivation: 美国过半数阿尔茫海默病患者未被诊断，语音基础的筛查提供了可扩展的检测方案。研究者希望通过比较不同的大语言模型适配策略，找到最有效的疾病检测方法。

Method: 在DementiaBank语音语料库上评估了12个模型（九个文本模型和三个多模态音频-文本模型）。测试了多种适配策略：上下文学习与不同示例选择策略、推理增强提示、参数高效微调以及多模态整合。

Result: 类质心示例在上下文学习中表现最佳，推理提示对较小模型有帮助，分词级微调通常获得最高分数。添加分类头显著改善了表现较差的模型。多模态模型表现良好但未超过最佳文本模型。

Conclusion: 模型适配策略（包括示例选择、推理设计和调整方法）对语音基础的疾病检测至关重要，适当适配的开源模型可以达到或超过商业系统的性能。

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

Conclusion: RBA框架能够显著缩小语音大语言模型与文本大语言模型之间的性能差距，为多模态语言模型的对齐提供了一种有效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency

  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of

of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过将营收会编码为层次话语树来生成语义丰富且结构意识的嵌入表示，每个节点包含多模态情感信号和结构元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法捐描营收会这种半结构化交流的层次话语结构。

Method: 采用两阶段Transformer架构：第一阶段通过对比学习在节点级利用多模态内容和话语元数据进行编码，第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义意义丰富的表征，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在财务报告领域有实用价值，还能渐迁到其他高风险非脚本化沟通领域，如远程医疗、教育和政治话语，提供了稳健且可解释的多模态话语表征方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

TL;DR: 早期自杀意念预测模型Early-SIB，通过分析青少年论坛发帖和互动内容，在本人显式表达自杀意念前预测自杀风险，达到0.73的平衡精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了实时分析青少年在线表达的机会。

Method: 提出Early-SIB转换器模型，逐序处理用户发帖和互动内容，预测其是否会发帖表达自杀意念和行为(SIB)，而不使用任何自我曝露信息作为输入。

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛数据集上，模型对预测未来SIB达到了0.73的平衡精度，显示出良好的预测能力。

Conclusion: 这种基于社交媒体的预测工具可以作为传统方法的有力补充，为早期识别和帮助有自杀风险的青少年提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

Conclusion: 提出了一种有前景的可扩展虚构检测方法，虽然注释过程费用较高，但一个模型的注释数据可以用于训练其他模型的分类器，并公开发布数据集以便重用。

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于几何聚类优化空间邻近性，而非下游信息理论分析，存在脱节问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发原则性主题识别方法，用计算高效上界替代难处理的KL散度项，实现熵正则化和鲁棒化的K-means变体

Result: UDIB方法生成共享主题表示，不仅在空间上连贯，而且在结构上最大化提示-响应关系的信息量

Conclusion: UDIB为语义分歧检测框架提供更优越的基础，为检测LLM幻觉提供了新颖且更敏感的工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表层模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象能力是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键技能

Method: 提出AR²对抗性强化学习框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的复杂描述而不改变基本逻辑，学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理和问题解决能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

Motivation: 解决LLM在产生事实一致答案时的局限性，以及传统RAG方法将知识作为非结构化文本处理的缺陷

Method: 动态构建知识图框架，先通过提示提取种子KG，然后迭代扩展LLM潜在知识，最后通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上表现一致提升，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是提升LLM事实性的结构化、可解释性和可扩展方向

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,

integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,

Conclusion: 即使在LLM时代，传统OCR系统由于其低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是边缘部署的最佳选择。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动评估器时存在自偏好偏差，即倾向于偏好自身输出而非其他模型输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 构建区分合理和不合理自偏好偏差的数据集，使用对比激活加法(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预。

Result: 导向向量可将不合理自偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法。

Conclusion: 导向向量在缓解自偏好偏差方面具有潜力但也存在局限性，在合理自偏好和无偏一致性上表现不稳定，表明自偏好涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更鲁棒的干预措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization

### [58] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个四指标评估套件来系统评估视觉语言模型在交互式基础任务中的表现，发现现有模型与人类模式存在显著差异，且任务成功分数不能准确反映基础建立的成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要在单轮或问答设置中评估视觉语言模型，但基础建立是一个交互过程，需要持续沟通来达成共同理解，因此需要新的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含基础效率、内容对齐、词汇适应和人类相似性四个指标的评估套件，在150个自玩会话中比较三个专有VLM与人类二人组的交互表现。

Result: 所有三个模型至少在三个指标上与人类模式存在差异，GPT4o-mini最接近人类表现；任务成功分数不能指示成功的基础建立，高图像-话语对齐也不一定预测任务成功。

Conclusion: 该指标套件为未来VLM基础研究提供了框架，揭示了当前模型在交互基础能力方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐句子级对应关系和多粒度评估，解决了LLM输出与句子级评估方法不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了现有的基于句子对齐的评估方法，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 1. Align阶段：自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系，重建目标文本以匹配源语句数量；2. n-Chunk滑动评估阶段：计算1、2、3、4个块的平均度量分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实测试集上与人类判断高度一致；生成的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和GRPO奖励模型。

Conclusion: 该框架是文档级机器翻译系统准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NE-PADD方法，通过语音命名实体识别和注意力机制来提升部分音频深度伪造检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频深度伪造检测只关注句子级别，而部分音频伪造检测需要帧级定位。现有方法在利用音频语义信息（特别是命名实体）方面研究不足

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和PADD检测。采用注意力融合(AF)和注意力转移(AT)两种注意力聚合机制，通过辅助损失函数利用命名实体语义指导检测

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 证明了整合命名实体知识在部分音频深度伪造检测中的有效性

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，即表面无意义但蕴含深层含义的表达。研究发现当前大语言模型难以理解这种多层次语义，构建了包含1200多个多语言样本的数据集进行测试，结果显示LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上存在明显局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在处理具有深度隐含意义的语言现象时的局限性，特别是那些语法连贯但在语用层面存在矛盾、情感负载或修辞颠覆性的表达。

Method: 研究方法包括：1）定义Drivelology概念；2）构建包含6种语言的1200多个精心筛选样本的数据集；3）通过专家多轮讨论和裁决进行标注；4）评估多种LLMs在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示LLMs存在明显局限：经常将Drivelology与浅层无意义内容混淆，产生不连贯的论证，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。这表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解。

Conclusion: 结论指出LLMs在语用理解方面存在深层次表征差距，需要超越表面连贯性来建模语言深度。研究发布了数据集和代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在语言理解、复杂问题解决和代码生成等任务上的表现，但对其如何影响语言模型可信度的全面理解仍不足。

Method: 对推理模型和思维链技术的近期研究进行系统性综述，按时间顺序对五个可信度维度（真实性、安全性、鲁棒性、公平性、隐私性）的研究进行结构化概述和方法论分析。

Result: 推理技术通过缓解幻觉、检测有害内容和提高鲁棒性来增强模型可信度，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在相当或更大的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 本研究为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的宝贵资源，指出了未来研究方向，强调需要关注推理模型自身的安全脆弱性问题。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了基于探针方法检测LLM有害指令的范式，发现探针学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性，揭示了当前方法存在的虚假安全感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令带来安全隐患，现有研究使用探针方法检测恶意输入，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现不佳，怀疑探针学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性。

Method: 通过控制实验系统验证假设：首先比较简单n-gram方法与探针方法的性能，然后使用语义清洗的数据集进行控制实验，最后详细分析模式依赖性。

Result: 确认探针确实学习的是表面模式（指令模式和触发词），而非语义危害性，简单n-gram方法可以达到类似性能，揭示了当前探针方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 当前基于探针的安全检测方法存在虚假安全感，需要重新设计模型和评估协议，作者开源了项目以促进该方向的负责任研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG组件解决现有移动代理的三大问题：LLM理解错误、缺乏环境交互和记忆能力缺失，在复杂移动任务上比现有方法提升10.3%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的移动代理存在三个主要问题：1)过度依赖LLM理解能力导致操作错误和步骤遗漏；2)缺乏与外部环境交互，当应用无法满足查询时任务终止；3)缺乏记忆能力，每次指令都需要重新构建界面且无法从错误中学习。

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含三个RAG增强组件：InterRAG用于交互增强，LocalRAG用于本地知识检索，MemRAG用于记忆管理。利用RAG技术更快速准确地识别用户查询并完成复杂长序列移动任务。

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试上，MobileRAG能够轻松处理真实世界的移动任务，比最先进方法提升10.3%的性能，且使用更少的操作步骤。

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了现有移动代理的局限性，显著提升了复杂移动任务的执行能力，为移动智能代理的发展提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂抽象问题因思维能力不足导致性能漏泉的问题，充分利用多实体多跳转知识信息

Method: 提出矩阵思维（MoT）结构，通过列-单元沟通机制在水平和垂直维度探索问题，构建知识单元实现事实纠正

Result: 在4个数据集上F1和EM指标超过最新方法，推理时间仅为基准方法的14.4%

Conclusion: MoT结构能够有效提升LLM在复杂QA任务中的思维能力和准确性，具有高效和准确的特点

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPoEM是一个用于现代韩语诗歌情感分析的新数据集，包含7662个标注条目，44种细粒度情感类别，基于该数据集微调的模型在情感分类任务上表现显著优于通用语料训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得了显著进展，但诗歌特别是韩语诗歌由于其比喻性语言和文化特殊性，仍然缺乏充分的研究。现有模型难以捕捉诗歌中特定时间和文化背景下的情感表达。

Method: 构建了包含7662个条目的多标签情感数据集（7007个行级条目和615个作品级条目），标注了44种细粒度情感类别。采用顺序微调策略：先在通用语料上预训练，然后在KPoEM数据集上微调。

Result: 基于KPoEM数据集微调的韩语模型显著优于之前模型，F1-micro得分达到0.60，而通用语料训练的模型仅为0.34。模型不仅能识别特定时空和文化的情感表达，还能保持现代韩语诗歌的核心情感。

Conclusion: 该研究架起了计算方法和文学分析之间的桥梁，通过结构化数据为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能性，忠实地保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中虽然能提升任务特定性能，但会导致灾难性遗忘，使模型失去原有知识和通用能力。现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列的logits与模型自身语义分布对齐，来保持模型的原始分布特性。

Result: 大量实验表明，SelfAug在下游学习与通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡。实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接关联。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL是一种针对Text-to-SQL任务的自博弈微调方法，通过验证驱动的迭代微调和错误驱动损失机制，解决了SPIN方法在SQL生成中的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自博弈微调(SPIN)方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性，无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型生成准确SQL的能力。

Method: 提出SPFT-SQL方法：1）自博弈前采用基于验证的迭代微调，根据数据库模式和验证反馈迭代合成高质量微调数据；2）自博弈阶段使用错误驱动损失方法，激励对手模型的错误输出，使主模型能够区分正确和错误的SQL。

Result: 在6个开源大语言模型和5个广泛使用的基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，通过创新的验证机制和错误驱动策略显著提升了SQL生成的准确性。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出了VoxRole基准，这是首个专门用于评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理的综合性基准，包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据，来自261部电影的1228个独特角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话代理研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽视了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等）；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用大语言模型为每个角色系统地构建多维度角色档案。基于此构建了VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 构建了包含13335个多轮对话、65.6小时语音数据的VoxRole基准，涵盖261部电影的1228个独特角色。利用该基准对当代语音对话模型进行了多维度评估，揭示了它们在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限。

Conclusion: VoxRole基准填补了语音角色扮演领域长期缺乏标准化评估工具的关键空白，为评估基于语音的角色扮演对话代理提供了首个综合性基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

TL;DR: 该论文针对极低资源语言Ladin，通过翻译意大利语数据创建情感分析和多项选择题问答的合成数据集，并证明这些数据能显著提升机器翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在极低资源语言（如土著语言）上效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏标注数据。Ladin作为一种濒危的罗曼语族语言，缺乏高质量NLP数据集，难以开发鲁棒的语言技术。

Method: 利用少量Ladin-意大利语句对，通过翻译意大利语单语数据创建合成数据集，采用严格的过滤和回译程序确保语言质量和可靠性。

Result: 将合成数据集融入机器翻译训练后，相比现有意大利语-Ladin翻译基线取得了显著改进。创建了首个公开可用的Ladin情感分析和MCQA数据集。

Conclusion: 为Ladin语言建立了基础资源，支持更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用，为其他低资源语言提供了可借鉴的方法。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

*Zhaoyan Gong,Juan Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA是一个新颖的时序知识图谱问答框架，通过递归分解问题、自底向上求解和多路径答案聚合来增强推理能力，无需训练即可在复杂时序查询中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序知识图谱问答方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播的问题。

Method: RTQA包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。采用递归思维将问题分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径答案聚合提高容错性。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架通过递归分解和聚合策略有效解决了复杂时序知识图谱问答的挑战，无需训练即可实现优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在基准测试中表现良好，但对改写后的相同问题效果显著下降，表明现有基准测试不能完全反映模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在真实应用中的表现，因为现实世界的问题存在语言变异性，需要模型在不同表述的相同问题上保持有效性。

Method: 系统生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，测试34个不同规模和性能的最先进LLM在这些改写问题上的效果变化。

Result: LLM排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数显著下降，表明模型在处理语言变异性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 基准测试评估的可靠性受到挑战，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 探究不同语言下模型输出的相似性，以及模型规模和能力对跨语言一致性的影响。

Method: 使用κ_p相似性度量指标，在GlobalMMLU数据集的20种语言和47个主题上分析模型输出的一致性。

Result: 模型越大、能力越强，其跨语言输出一致性越高；模型自身的跨语言一致性优于不同模型在同一语言中的一致性。

Conclusion: κ_p是评估多语言可靠性的实用工具，有助于指导开发更一致的多语言系统。

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

TL;DR: 基于RoBERTa的中文功能语法注释模型，首次实现了系统功能语法理论在中文文本中的自动化注释，在识别主语、动词、补语等核心语法元素方面取得优异性能，F1值达0.852。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统功能语法理论在中文文本中缺乏自动化注释工具，限制了相关理论的应用和推广，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用人民日报2014语料库中随机选取4100句子进行功能语法注释建立数据集，基于RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型进行细调，实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 在测试集上获得0.852的F1分数，显著超过其他对比模型。在识别主语、主动词、补语等核心语法元素方面表现优异，但在标签样本不均衡的实体识别上仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将功能语法与注意力机制NLP模型结合，为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Conclusion: 首次提出基于音乐理论规则合成乐谱问题的方法，不仅有效提升了模型对乐谱的理解能力，还为AI辅助音乐创作开启了新可能性

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Result: 研究发现，虽然聊天机器在英语等语言中取得了成功，但阿拉伯语教育聊天机器中采用现代技术的系统很少，存在显著的研究空白和技术差距。

Conclusion: 本研究系统地识别了阿拉伯语教育聊天机器领域的研究状况和挑战，为该领域的未来研究指明了方向，希望能够促进更多采用先进AI技术的阿拉伯语教育聊天机器开发。

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Conclusion: 结合辅助知识库的混合方法能有效提升隐性叙事检测和解释的质量，为复杂文本分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Method: 通过变更语音转写数据量和各词性类别的项目数量，使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似性指标评估模型性能。

Result: 小规模紧凑模型表现最佳：10分钟语音转写，形容词和连词各5项，副词、名词、代词、动词各10项。

Conclusion: 研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实用方法，为会话机器人的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对可扩展心理咨询需求的增长，需要高质量、隐私合规的数据来微调开源大语言模型，但此类数据稀缺。现有单智能体方法难以捕捉真实咨询的结构和细微差别。

Method: 提出MAGneT多智能体框架，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，由专门建模关键心理技术的LLM智能体处理。同时提出统一的评估框架，整合多种自动和专家指标，将专家评估从4个方面扩展到9个方面。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架有效解决了高质量心理咨询数据稀缺的问题，通过多智能体方法更好地模拟真实咨询过程，生成的合成数据质量更高，可用于有效微调开源LLM模型，推动可扩展心理咨询的发展。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效解决了社交媒体事件检测中标注数据稀缺的问题，通过双重增强策略显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实正确性，还应考虑非常规情境下的适应性，该基准可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但其静态训练数据导致的过时知识记忆可能会提供有害建议或在临床推理任务中失败。

Method: 构建了两个新的问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖普通生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，医学共识已经发生变化），并对八个主流大语言模型进行评估。

Result: 所有模型都存在一致的过时知识依赖问题，研究分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略的影响。

Conclusion: 论文为开发更新预和可靠的医疗AI系统提供了基础，并提出了减缓过时知识依赖问题的未来方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO是一种语音增强的上下文ASR方法，通过音素感知编码、对比实体消歧和分层过滤，显著提升命名实体识别准确率，在中文和英文数据集上均优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）识别上表现不佳，上下文ASR方法由于实体多样性有限和独立token处理方式，无法捕捉细粒度音素变化和完整的多token偏置

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索，减少误报

Result: 在1000个干扰项下，中文AISHELL-1数据集CER达到4.22%，英文DATA2数据集WER达到11.14%，显著优于基线方法，在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健增益

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习机制，有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别问题，在多个数据集上证明了其优越性和泛化能力

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM性别偏见评估具有脆弱性，即使微小的提示词变化也会显著改变偏见测量结果，甚至完全反转偏见方向。离散选择指标相比概率指标会放大偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的应用增加，性别偏见问题日益受到关注，但现有评估方法往往使用与自然语言分布不同的任务提示，可能影响测量结果的有效性。

Method: 通过设计不同提示条件测试模型：(1)使测试情境显著，(2)使性别相关内容显著。在四种任务格式中使用token概率和离散选择指标评估提示敏感性。

Result: 发现即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时会完全反转偏见方向。离散选择指标倾向于比概率测量放大偏见。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试社区提出了新问题：受控测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"表现，这对未来基准的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Motivation: 虽然之前的研究分析和改善了语言模型的时间推理能力，但大多数研究仅聚焦于公历，而很多非公历系统如日本历、希吉来历和希伯来历等仍在活跃使用且反映了文化根基的时间概念

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行系统性评估

Result: 发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使日语中心模型也在日本历算术和多历法一致性维持方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 结果强调了开发更好处理文化特定历法理解的语言模型的重要性

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Motivation: 现有MAE方法仅限于原始关节坐标或简单变体的重建，导致计算冗余和语义表征能力有限。

Method: 提出协同学习框架，通过轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化的监督信号，包含约束优化确保特征多样性。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD数据集上验证：训练速度提升6.2倍，表征质量优秀，在各种下游任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GFP框架通过高级特征预测替代低级重建，有效解决了MAE在骨架动作识别中的计算冗余和语义表征问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于UNet分割的老师-学生模型，通过对比学习和域对抗训练来解决有线分裂图检测中的域偏移和数据不平衡问题，在预测试验集上取得了较高的F1分数和平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有线分裂图计数工作耗时且存在观察者间差异，AI自动检测可以解决这个问题但容易受域偏移影响，同时有线分裂图数量远少于正常核引发严重的数据不平衡问题。

Method: 使用UNet分割背链集成对比表征学习和域对抗训练模块，采用老师-学生策略生成像素级伪掩码，并在多任务学习框架下使用多尺度CNN分类器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将分割基础的检测和分类集成到统一框架中，有效地提高了有线分裂图分析的稳健性和性能。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调，有效解决视觉模型中的多重偏差问题，无需测试时组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多重重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别化妆、场景对象配对等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 1. 自适应偏差集成学习（ABIL）：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器明确识别这些偏差
2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，得到忽略所有已识别偏差的紧凑网络
3. 引入Scaled Bias Amplification（SBA）指标，在测试时分离模型引起的偏差放大和分布差异

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证：
- 提升最差组准确率
- 将多属性偏差放大减半
- 在SBA指标上创下新低
- 即使偏差复杂性和分布变化加剧，仍保持良好性能

Conclusion: GMBM是首个实用的端到端多重偏差解决方案，只需训练时组标签，测试时无需组标签，能有效处理视觉识别中的多重偏差问题。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过细致的消融研究优化了nnU-Net在心辅图左室分割中的组件，开发出了一种轻量级U-Net模型，在保持类似性能的同时大大减少了模型规模和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心辅图左室分割中表现良好，但其模型过大且速度慢，限制了实时应用。需要开发更轻量级的模型来支持自动化临床测量提取。

Method: 通过消融研究评估数据增帽方案、网络结构修改、损失函数和后处理技术等组件，识别nnU-Net中最有效的成分，并基于这些见解开发轻量级U-Net模型。

Result: 轻量级U-Net模型参数量仅为2M（nnU-Net为33M），在CAMUS数据集上达到了统计学上等效的性能（Dice分数左室0.93、肌肉0.85、房间0.89），模型大小减少16倍，速度提高4倍（每帧1.35ms vs 5.40ms）。在内部数据集上也显示了类似的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 简单的affine增帽和深度监督是驱动性能的关键因素，而复杂的增帽和大模型容量带来的收益逐渐减少。这个轻量级模型为实时心辅图分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习鲁棒3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: 采用双重监督范式，在双编码器架构中设计互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，同时利用3D几何信息作为输入和显式学习目标，强制几何一致性以促进空间推理能力的发展。

Result: 在ScanQA、Scan2Cap、ScanRefer和SQA3D等数据集上的广泛实验表明，Reg3D带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们，实现了有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Conclusion: 完全量化的多智能体中间融合系统在实际部署中具有可行性，为V2X协同感知的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构来捕捉空间关系，现有图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: 推迟跨图节点级交互到联合嵌入架构末端，使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点嵌入的距离函数

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图匹配方法，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理速度，适用于搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [99] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅需微调0.04%的参数即可实现领域适应，在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和完整微调，成本高且可能破坏预训练知识。需要一种参数高效的方法来保持模型泛化能力。

Method: 使用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量，无需注入额外模块，实现多模态参数高效适应。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上取得最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下准确率和泛化能力均优于先前方法，仅使用模型总参数的0.04%。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种有效的参数高效适应方法，能够保持预训练知识的同时实现优异的领域适应性能，并具有可解释性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

Conclusion: 基于基因组矩阵的深度学习方法是一种有前景的方法，可以用来识别与血液生物标记物相关的基因模块，以支持无侵入性疾病监测和预后评估。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了水下伪装目标检测(UCOD)任务，创建了DeepCamo基准数据集，并开发了SLENet框架，通过Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement模块和Localization Guidance Branch提升多尺度特征表示，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重影响，需要专门的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement(GAE)模块增强多尺度特征，Localization Guidance Branch(LGB)生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder(MSSD)进行精确预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet超越了现有最先进方法，展现出优异的性能和高泛化能力。

Conclusion: SLENet为水下伪装目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性，对更广泛的COD任务具有高度通用性。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态图像训练方式在捕捉时间序列信息时存在信息不足，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖有限和治理化能力下降

Method: 利用连续视频帧的时间归纳偏置，无需网络结构改变，可无缝集成到标准涵散训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上验证，训练收敛速度提升2倍以上，FID指标更低，生成多样性更好，通过降低梯度方差促进更快收敛

Conclusion: 这种基于时间归纳偏置的简单训练策略能够显著提升涵散模型的训练效率和性能，为视频生成领域提供了有效的改进方向

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像-文本对齐来解决放射诊断中的误读、注意力盲区和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（包括误读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足精确局部检测、全局体积级推理和语义一致的自然语言报告需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强视觉语言预训练框架，执行局部和全局图像-文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答方面实现了最先进的性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过结合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射学分析中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

Result: 在15个数据集上实验证明显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上表现突出

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒化和因果推理学习到的视觉粒能够产生更具判别性的文本提示，有效提升细粒度识别性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入湍流消除任务具有显著的效率优势，事件相机的高时间分辨率和稀疏成像特性为湍流消除提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-事件检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。固定token选择方法无法适应不同复杂度的样本

Method: 提出事件引导多模态稀疏化(EGMS)策略识别并自适应丢弃各模态低信息区域，以及跨模态聚焦融合(CMFF)模块有效整合互补特征

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合互补信息，成功解决了RGB-事件检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了性能与效率的双重提升

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is

Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在3D占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化、以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种新的方法来同时解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的TENS任务分解和TensFormer架构，成功解决了3D占用世界建模中的关键挑战，为可控、高效、高质量的长期3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Motivation: 在不同类别物体间建立密集对应关系对于形状重建和机器人操作等任务至关重要。物体功能（即物体对其他物体产生的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的物体部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 提出弱监督学习范式：1）利用视觉语言模型对多视角图像进行伪标注获取功能部件；2）结合密集对比学习从像素对应关系中提取功能和空间知识；3）将知识蒸馏到新模型中建立密集功能对应关系。

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉语言模型和密集对比学习的结合，成功建立了跨类别的密集功能对应关系，为形状重建和机器人操作等应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

*Xiaofu Chen,Israfel Salazar,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务设计的无参考评估指标，通过增强CLIP的特异性来奖励正确细节并惩罚错误信息，在保持与人类判断高相关性的同时显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在不足：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，基于表示相似性的指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM-based指标虽然相关性好但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代评估。

Method: 基于CLIP进行改进，引入新的目标函数来增强特异性，通过奖励正确细节和惩罚错误信息来优化评估效果。

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM-based指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，为图像描述模型开发提供了实用的迭代评估方案。

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个高效且准确的评估方案，解决了长图像描述任务中现有评估指标的局限性，特别适合在模型开发过程中进行迭代评估使用。

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种绘图学习的多视角视频编码框架(LMVC)，通过利用独立视角的运动和内容信息来提升依赖视角的压缩效率，在保持随机访问和向后兼容性的同时显著超越传统MV-HEVC标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频作为体积视频的关键数据源，存储和传输面临巨大数据量挑战。当前深度学习视频编码主要集中在单视角或立体视频，对于普通多视角场景的研究较少。

Method: 提出了两个核心模块：1)基于特征的视间运动向量预测方法，利用解码后的独立视角运动特征来条件化依赖视角的运动编码；2)无视差的视间上下文预测模块，从解码后的独立视角内容特征预测视间上下文。同时配合相应的视间运动咄视间上下文的熵绩模型。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够有效利用视间相关性的绘图学习多视角视频编码方案，在保持重要功能性的同时实现了显著的压缩性能提升。

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程细化方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学管状结构重建方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性。虽然拓扑感知损失和持久同调约束有所改进，但通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局拓扑保持和推理时的几何错误修正。

Method: TopoSculpt采用：(1)整体区域建模策略捕捉完整空间上下文；(2)拓扑完整性Betti约束联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；(3)基于持久同调的课程细化方案，从粗到细逐步修正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上的实验显示显著改进：β₀错误从69.00降至3.40（气道）和1.65降至0.30（CoW），树长检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效修正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑重建方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Conclusion: 该深度学习模型能够准确地定位气胸区域，为放射科医生提供了有效的诊断支持工具，有助于提高气胸诊断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应负文本空间(ANTS)方法，利用多模态大语言模型的理解和推理能力来增强OOD检测，在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95 4.2%，实现新的SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对OOD图像的理解，难以构建准确的负空间，且假阴性标签会严重降低近OOD性能

Method: 利用MLLMs识别可能为OOD样本的图像并生成表达性负句子来精确描述OOD分布；对于近OOD场景，识别与负图像视觉相似的ID类别子集，生成定制的视觉相似负标签；设计自适应加权分数来平衡两种负文本空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上显著降低FPR95 4.2%，建立新的最先进性能；方法无需训练且零样本，具有高可扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过利用MLLMs的能力有效解决了OOD检测中的负空间构建问题，在近OOD和远OOD场景下都表现出色，具有很好的适应性和实用性

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在光照和噪声干扰下特征表示有限，变化模式建模和泛化能力不足，需要多模态融合来提升性能。

Method: 提出Image Feature Refinement模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；使用视觉语言模型生成语义描述；Textual Difference Enhancement模块捕获细粒度语义变化；Image-Text Feature Fusion模块实现深度跨模态融合。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了多模态融合在遥感变化检测中的有效性，提供了更准确和鲁棒的变化检测解决方案。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

TL;DR: SAC-MIL是一种用于WSI分类的空间感知相关多实例学习方法，通过位置编码模块和SAC块实现全实例相关性计算，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI分类中空间信息利用不足和计算效率问题，传统方法如基于Transformer的方法需要定制CUDA内核且计算复杂度高

Method: 包含位置编码模块（利用实例坐标编码空间关系，处理长度外推问题）和SAC块（基于MLP的全实例相关性计算，线性时间复杂度）

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: SAC-MIL提供了一种高效且易于部署的WSI分类方法，无需定制CUDA内核，在计算效率和性能方面都有显著优势

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 即使只在训练期可用，信息丰富的辅助成像模态也能有效补充专家标注，提升分割性能

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中提示词设计的敏感性，即使微小变化可导致15%的准确率差异，提出了Promptception框架系统评估提示词敏感性，并为不同模型类型提供了专门的提示原则。

Motivation: 当前大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为模型通常使用精心挑选的提示词来报告最佳性能。

Method: 提出了Promptception框架，包含61种提示类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的大型多模态模型在3个多项选择题基准测试上的表现。

Result: 研究发现专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型更稳定但难以处理复杂表达；提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估，提升评估透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理立方体特征时忽视高度轴信息，传统通道注意力机制在所有高度层赋予均匀权重，限制了不同高度特征的强调能力

Method: 提出SliceSemOcc框架：1）使用全局和局部垂直切片提取高度轴立方体特征 2）全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文 3）SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率，为每个高度层赋予动态通道注意力权重

Conclusion: 详细的消融研究证明了SliceSemOcc框架的有效性，通过垂直切片和高度维度注意力机制，有效解决了现有方法在高度轴信息处理上的不足

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: LML是一个有价值的多类MIL问题，提出的方法能够有效地从多数标签中学习实例级分类。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于飞腾处理器和寒武纪加速卡的异构计算架构，构建了响应时间毫秒级的无人机跟踪监控系统，解决了传统监控系统在动态场景中响应延迟超过200ms的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄像机系统因深度特征提取能力不足和计算架构效率瓶颈，在动态场景中响应延迟超过200ms，无法满足复杂场景下的实时要求。

Method: 硬件层面采用飞腾FT-2000/4处理器与MLU220加速卡协同计算架构，通过多卡并行提升计算能力；软件层面创新整合轻量级YOLOv5s检测网络与DeepSORT级联跟踪算法，形成"检测-跟踪-反馈"闭环控制链。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于K近邻加权融合(KWF)的高效多视角特征重排方法，通过聚合邻居特征来减少视角偏差，在不需额外注释的情况下显著提升了人员重识别的Rank@1和mAP指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前的重排方法主要使用单视角图像特征，容易受到姿态变化、视角改变和遮挡等问题的影响，导致视角偏差。使用多视角特征可以更全面地表示一个人，减少视角偏差

Method: 提出K近邻加权融合(KWF)方法，在无监督方式下选择K个邻居特征来生成多视角特征。这个方法偏向于选择表示相同身份的高相似性特征，并研究了特征聚合过程中的权重选择策略

Result: 在Market1501、MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC数据集上进行评估，方法显著提升了Rank@1和mAP指标。特别是在挑战性数据集MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC上，Rank@1分别提升9.8%和22.0%。该方法还显示出较其他重排方法更高的计算效率

Conclusion: 该研究提出的KWF重排方法通过聚合多视角特征有效减少了视角偏差，在不需模型微调或额外注释的情况下实现了显著的性能提升，并具有良好的计算效率，适用于大规模数据集

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

TL;DR: 通过双向文本融合模块和类别感知时间图模块，结合了关注机制和伪标签生成两种方法的优势，实现了音视频解析任务的独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两类问题：一类将噪声分布伪标签视为可靠监督，另一类让无区别性关注把错误传播到所有帧，导致训练过程中错误被重复放大。

Method: 提出双向文本融合(BiT)模块进行语义注射和动态检测，定位和净化清洁且丰富的语义线索；利用类别感知时间图(CATS)模块进行语义传播和连接，实现精确的语义信息在时间上的传播。

Result: 在LLP和UnAV-100两个标准数据集上的多个关键指标上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过结合两种之前研究方向的优势和互补性，成功解决了弱监督学习中初始错误放大的问题，实现了音视频解析的重大进步。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个用于生成多角色故事图像的新框架，通过迭代过程保持角色一致性，并准确分配对话，解决了现有方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在多个角色跨帧交互时存在角色一致性差、生成伪影和对话渲染不准确的问题，导致故事叙述不连贯。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用基于有界注意力的每框掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致的自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性，以及区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置，最后通过CLIPSeg将对话气泡分配给角色。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion框架有效解决了多角色故事生成中的角色一致性和对话准确分配问题，为文本到故事可视化提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂多元素提示时表现不佳，且风格多样性有限，需要一种能够精确解析空间位置和风格信息，并支持多专家协同生成的解决方案。

Method: 提出MEPG框架，包含两个核心组件：(1)位置-风格感知模块使用微调后的LLM分解输入提示为精确空间坐标和风格编码语义指令；(2)多专家扩散模块通过动态专家路由在局部区域和全局区域实现跨区域生成，使用基于注意力的门控机制选择性地激活专家模型。

Result: 实验表明MEPG在相同骨干网络下显著优于基线模型，在图像质量和风格多样性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: MEPG框架通过整合位置-风格感知LLM和多专家模块，有效解决了复杂多元素提示生成问题，提供了强大的可扩展性和实时交互编辑能力，为文本到图像生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Conclusion: 简单的预训练视觉模型通过精心调参即可实现高性能深度伪造检测，在准确性、计算成本和可解释性之间取得平衡，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，难以扩展到大型数据集，需要开发自动化解决方案来提高标注效率。

Method: 结合CLIP与预训练检测器（Ultralytics模型）和零样本模型（Grounding DINO），使用低置信度阈值生成初始标注，并通过交互式工具进行精炼，支持边界框、定向边界框和多边形标注，集成Segment Anything进行实时分割。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像上对齐跨域特征时，由于关键的对象特征经常与域特定风格纠缠，难以处理域差距问题

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，分离对象特征和域特定风格，并通过渐进式对齐域内和跨域的互近邻来实现可靠的特征对齐

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的13个域中实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐方法有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域差距问题，取得了优异的检索效果

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Conclusion: LASER框架有效提升了VLM在多步感知和坐标预测方面的能力，为GUI grounding任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: 混合DMP架构能够有效提升遥感图像语义分割的性能，通过提供多尺度形状信息来应对遥感图像的特有挑战。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Method: 1) 使用稀疏视图3D重建技术独立重建每个铰接状态；2) 学习建立跨位姿密集对应关系的变形场；3) 采用渐进解耦策略分离静态和运动部件；4) 通过自监督损失联合优化几何、外观和运动学参数

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了稀疏视图、无相机位姿监督条件下的铰接物体表示学习问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena是一个用于评估大型视觉语言模型在全球图像地理定位任务中的开放平台，解决了现有评估方法的数据泄露和隐私问题，通过真实野外图像和人类判断进行更准确的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大型视觉语言模型常在测试数据集上预训练，影响评估准确性；2）现有指标依赖精确地理坐标，忽视推理过程并带来隐私担忧。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来确定哪个模型输出更符合人类期望，而非依赖精确坐标。

Result: 平台上线两个月收集了数千条投票记录，基于这些数据进行了详细分析，并建立了不同大型视觉语言模型在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜。

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个真实野外和以人为中心的基准测试平台，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，为图像地理定位任务提供了更准确和隐私友好的评估框架。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架首次将基于DiT架构的高级编辑模型用于密集几何预测，通过重新制定损失函数和量化策略，在零样本深度和法线估计任务中取得了显著性能提升，甚至超越了使用100倍训练数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，而图像编辑模型（而非文本到图像生成模型）可能更适合作为微调的基础，因为编辑模型具有固有的结构先验。

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将基于Diffusion Transformer的编辑模型适配于密集几何预测：1）将流匹配损失重新制定为"一致速度"训练目标；2）使用对数量化解决精度冲突；3）利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计。

Result: 在不增加训练数据的情况下，FE2E在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计中取得了显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上获得超过35%的性能增益，并超越了使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列模型。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何估计任务，FE2E框架通过有效利用编辑模型的结构先验和DiT架构的优势，在零样本密集预测任务中实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Result: 在DFEW和FERV39k等野外数据集上的大量实验表明，MICACL实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MICACL框架有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的长尾分布和时空建模问题，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes

impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个将图像美学显著性整合到多模态大语言模型中专门用于美学图像描述任务的框架，通过显式融入美学显著性特征有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Result: 在模拟和实验数据上均实现了卓越的重建质量，在挑战性低信号条件下表现出显著鲁棒性

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息化的框架，适用于解决探针相关的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UCF-UM框架，通过循环评估协议量化统一视觉语言模型在图像理解和生成之间的语义漂移，揭示了现有单次评估无法发现的跨模态一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法单独考察视觉理解和生成能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中的语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Method: 提出UCF-UM循环评估协议，包含三个指标：平均累积漂移(MCD)、语义漂移率(SDR)和多代GenEval(MGG)，并在ND400新基准上评估7个最新模型。

Result: 发现不同模型的跨模态稳定性差异显著，如BAGEL能保持语义而Vila-u快速漂移，尽管单次评估得分都很高。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，为统一模型的跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度提供了实用度量标准。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching和Velocity Distillation两种优化目标，将25步采样减少到1-2步，实现9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高质量的3D生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要数十步采样，虽然一致性模型在2D扩散模型加速方面取得进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍未充分探索。

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching(VM)学习稳定匹配师生速度场，Velocity Distillation(VD)利用学习到的速度场进行概率密度蒸馏，将优化目标从传输层面转换到速度和分布层面。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步数从25减少到1-2步，实现0.68秒(1步×2)和0.94秒(2步×2)的延迟，A800上分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中实现卓越性能，为3D生成模型的加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决肖像动画中高保真、空间一致的属性迁移问题，特别是在零样本设置下处理不同空间范围的属性和位置不对齐的挑战。

Method: 采用自重建训练框架，双参考网络注入空间特征，掩码扩展策略处理不同空间范围的属性，并通过空间和外观级变换增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在肖像动画属性迁移任务上达到最先进性能，能够有效泛化到多样属性和真实参考组合，支持单次生成中的多属性组合。

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络设计和训练策略，成功实现了零样本肖像动画的高质量属性迁移，为多属性组合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Motivation: 准直器阴影检测对于限制疾病医疗对患者的放射暴露至关重要，但散射X光线会使边缘模糊增加检测难度

Method: 结合可微分震变变换网络检测准直器边界，并从两个任务中结合信息生成线条约束的精细分割面具

Result: 在真实X光影像测试集上实现了稳健的准直区域重建，中位洪斯多夫距离为4.3-5.0mm

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测准直器阴影，虽然应用中最多只有4个边缘，但方法本质上不受边数的限制

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Motivation: 因全景图像(ODIs)在虚拟现实、自主驾驶等领域的需求增长，但其与透视图像在几何投影、空间分布和边界连续性上存在显著差异，直接域适配面临挑战。

Method: 首先回顾全景成像流程和投影方法，分析结构差异，总结三大域适配挑战：极点附近的严重几何扭曲、等矩投影中的非均匀采样、周期性边界连续性。基于此，给出了跨方法分析和跨任务比较的两维分析框架。

Conclusion: 论文为全景视觉技术的发展提供了新的见解和前瞻性观点，讨论了数据、模型和应用方面的开放性挑战和未来方向，有助于推动全景视觉研究的进步。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在创意领域的广泛应用，需要提供增强的控制能力、精炼功能以及在生成后保持一致性的图像修改方法。现有方法缺乏在保持多帧视觉和叙事一致性的同时进行精细或粗略编辑的灵活性。

Method: 引入了Plot'n Polish，这是一个零样本框架，能够实现一致的故事生成，并在不同细节级别上提供对故事可视化的细粒度控制。

Result: 该框架解决了现有方法在保持视觉和叙事一致性方面的局限性，使创作者能够无缝地制作和精炼视觉故事。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Motivation: 多模态虚假信息（包含文本、视觉和跨模态扭曲）对社会威胁日益严重，现有方法通常只关注单一扭曲类型且难以泛化到未见场景。

Method: 提出TRUST-VL模型，包含新颖的问题感知视觉放大器模块提取任务特定视觉特征，并使用TRUST-Instruct大规模指令数据集（198K样本）进行训练，该数据集包含结构化推理链。

Result: 在领域内和零样本基准测试中，TRUST-VL实现了最先进的性能，同时展现出强大的泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 联合训练不同扭曲类型有助于知识共享并增强模型泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决传统虚拟试穿视频生成需要大量计算资源和长视频数据的问题，同时实现任意长度视频的生成能力。

Method: 采用分段自回归生成方法，使用前缀视频条件确保局部平滑性，通过360度锚点视频保持全局时间一致性。

Result: 成功生成了分钟级别的虚拟试穿视频，在各种动作下都保持了良好的局部平滑性和全局时间一致性。

Conclusion: VFR是长虚拟试穿视频生成领域的开创性工作，为任意长度视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Motivation: HPEC图挑战代表了传统基准测试无法覆盖的复杂HPC工作负载，需要新的软件组件和方法来处理端到端的图分析任务

Method: 使用数据科学的语言重新解释GraphBLAS公式，采用NVIDIA RAPIDS生态系统中的现成ETL工具（cuDF和cupy）来实现图挑战，无需编写特定的HPC代码

Result: 在NVIDIA GPU上实现了显著的软件加速：A100 GPU获得147-509倍加速，H100 GPU获得243-1269倍加速，H200 GPU获得332-2185倍加速

Conclusion: 使用现成的企业级软件工具可以实现HPEC图挑战的高性能实现，避免了传统HPC代码开发的复杂性，同时获得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: The HPEC Graph Challenge is a collection of benchmarks representing complex
workloads that test the hardware and software components of HPC systems, which
traditional benchmarks, such as LINPACK, do not. The first benchmark, Subgraph
Isomorphism, focused on several compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. The
most recent of the challenges, the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,
represents a shift in direction, as it represents a longer end-to-end workload
that requires many more software components, including, but not limited to,
data I/O, data structures for representing graph data, and a wide range of
functions for data preparation and network analysis. A notable feature of this
new graph challenge is the use of GraphBLAS to represent the computational
aspects of the problem statement. In this paper, we show an alternative
interpretation of the GraphBLAS formulations using the language of data
science. With this formulation, we show that the new graph challenge can be
implemented using off-the-shelf ETL tools available in open-source, enterprise
software such as NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem. Using off-the-shelf software,
RAPIDS cuDF and cupy, we enable significant software acceleration without
requiring any specific HPC code and show speedups, over the same code running
with Pandas on the CPU, of 147x-509x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, 243x-1269X for an
NVIDIA H100 GPU, and 332X-2185X for an NVIDIA H200 GPU.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The distributedData Retrieval (DR) model consists of $k$ peers connected by a
complete peer-to-peer communication network, and a trusted external data source
that stores an array $\textbf{X}$ of $n$ bits ($n \gg k$). Up to $\beta k$ of
the peers might fail in any execution (for $\beta \in [0, 1)$). Peers can
obtain the information either by inexpensive messages passed among themselves
or through expensive queries to the source array $\textbf{X}$. In the DR model,
we focus on designing protocols that minimize the number of queries performed
by any nonfaulty peer (a measure referred to as query complexity) while
maximizing the resilience parameter $\beta$.
  The Download problem requires each nonfaulty peer to correctly learn the
entire array $\textbf{X}$. Earlier work on this problem focused on synchronous
communication networks and established several deterministic and randomized
upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to extend the study of
distributed data retrieval to asynchronous communication networks. We address
the Download problem under both the Byzantine and crash failure models. We
present query-optimal deterministic solutions in an asynchronous model that can
tolerate any fixed fraction $\beta<1$ of crash faults. In the Byzantine failure
model, it is known that deterministic protocols incur a query complexity of
$\Omega(n)$ per peer, even under synchrony. We extend this lower bound to
randomized protocols in the asynchronous model for $\beta \geq 1/2$, and
further show that for $\beta < 1/2$, a randomized protocol exists with
near-optimal query complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to address the Download problem in asynchronous communication networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在π-可见性模型下解决机器人聚集问题的算法，适用于具有有限通信能力的机器人在完全异步调度器下的非刚性运动场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有限可见性（π-可见性）环境下自主、匿名、同质机器人的聚集问题。之前的研究表明，即使从可见性中移除一个点（π点），聚集也变得困难，且现有算法需要半同步调度器或有限状态自动机。

Method: 设计了一种基于有限通信能力（FCOM）的算法，机器人在完全异步调度器下进行非刚性运动，能够在π-可见性模型（仅移除角距离π点的可见性）下实现聚集。

Result: 成功解决了π-可见性模型下的机器人聚集问题，相比之前需要半同步调度或有限状态自动机的方法，本算法在完全异步调度器和有限通信能力下实现了聚集。

Conclusion: 该算法证明了在π-可见性、有限通信能力、完全异步调度器和非刚性运动条件下，机器人聚集问题是可解的，为有限可见性环境下的多机器人协调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the gathering problem for a set of autonomous, anonymous,
and homogeneous robots with limited visibility operating in a continuous
circle. The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a
rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise
direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots
on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna
\textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is
impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$
visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$
visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is
removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a
gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory
($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.
  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be
done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous
scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one
point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots
had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite
communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$). In this work the robot movement is
non-rigid and the robots work under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

Abstract: We consider large-scale systems influenced by burnout variables - state
variables that start active, shape dynamics, and irreversibly deactivate once
certain conditions are met. Simulating what-if scenarios in such systems is
computationally demanding, as alternative trajectories often require sequential
processing, which does not scale very well. This challenge arises in settings
like online advertising, because of campaigns budgets, complicating
counterfactual analysis despite rich data availability. We introduce a new type
of algorithms based on what we refer to as uncertainty relaxation, that enables
efficient parallel computation, significantly improving scalability for
counterfactual estimation in systems with burnout variables.

Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures,
so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies
focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it
generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading
training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to
reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application
to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework
that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints
to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write
optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also
dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to
maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient
reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence
strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression.
Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing
frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\% runtime overhead.

TL;DR: 本文证明在同步机器人在有限图上移动时，无限计算能力对OBLOT模型有显著影响，并提出了一种保证最少移动和轮次的最优解决算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OBLOT模型中机器人能力有限（匿名、无方向感、无记忆、无声），算法设计具有挑战性。现有研究主要关注移动次数和轮次成本，而忽略了计算能力的影响

Method: 利用同步机器人在有限图上的无限计算能力，开发了一种适用于广泛问题类别的最终解决算法

Result: 证明了无限计算能力在OBLOT模型中具有显著影响，所提算法能够保证最少移动次数和轮次

Conclusion: 计算能力是OBLOT模型中不可忽视的重要因素，利用无限计算能力可以设计出最优的分布式算法

Abstract: The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics.
It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are
anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their
only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,
i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of
distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous
research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished
within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed
computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is
neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the
number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove
that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited
computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,
by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to
a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and
rounds.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 量子网络中纠缠态保真度受存储时环境退相干影响，传统纯化协议因经典通信延迟导致空闲期进一步降低保真度。本文分析BBPSSW和DEJMPS协议在IP网络非瞬时经典协调下的可行性，通过微观Lindblad动力学模型和实际网络延迟数据，确定纯化成功与失败的相空间边界，为当前和近未来网络部署提供延迟预算和资源需求估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子网络需要高保真度纠缠对，但环境退相干会降低存储期间的保真度。纠缠纯化可用于恢复保真度，但经典通信延迟导致的空闲期会使量子态暴露于更多退相干，抵消纯化效果。需要分析在实际IP网络条件下纯化协议的可行性。

Method: 采用微观Lindblad方法处理量子动力学，使用当前城域IP网络延迟统计数据和量子内存测试平台参数，全面评估BBPSSW和DEJMPS协议在不同网络条件下的性能，确定保真度平衡等值线划分的成功失败区域。

Result: 确定了纠缠纯化成功与失败的相空间边界，计算了完成多轮纯化协议所需的总纠缠对数量，以及超过应用特定阈值的纯化保真度纠缠对的稳态吞吐量。

Conclusion: 研究为在当前和近未来网络中部署纠缠纯化提供了关键的延迟预算、内存质量目标和资源开销估计，明确了协议适用的网络条件和内存技术要求。

Abstract: Quantum networks rely on high fidelity entangled pairs distributed to nodes,
but maintaining their fidelity is challenged by environmental decoherence
during storage. Entanglement purification is used to restore fidelity, but the
idle periods imposed by the associated classical communication delays
counteract this goal by exposing the states to further decoherence. In this
work, we analyze the practical viability of entanglement purification protocols
(BBPSSW, DEJMPS), under non-instantaneous classical coordination over Internet
protocol (IP) communications networks. We present a comprehensive performance
evaluation of these protocols in various network conditions for a range of
quantum memory technologies. We employ a microscopic Lindblad treatment of the
underlying quantum dynamics, and use current-generation metropolitan IP network
latency statistics and parameters drawn from quantum memory testbeds. In doing
so we identify the regions in which entanglement purification succeeds and
fails, delineated by break-even iso-fidelity contours in the phase space. We
then determine the total number of entangled pairs required to complete a
multi-round purification protocol, and the steady-state throughput of entangled
pairs with purified fidelities that exceed application-specific thresholds.
This provides latency budgets, memory quality targets, and resource-overhead
estimates for deploying purification on current and near-future networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决队列网络中边传输成本未知情况下的联合路由调度问题，传统老虎机方法无法直接应用因为需要考虑队列动态和网络稳定性，需要同时优化吞吐量和成本。

Method: 使用Lyapunov漂移加惩罚优化技术和多臂老虎机方法，开发了一种网络控制策略，该策略能够处理探索-利用权衡并确保网络稳定性。

Result: 提出的策略实现了O(√T log T)的次线性遗憾界，相比完全了解到达和成本信息的最优策略，并通过仿真验证了遗憾确实为次线性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了未知传输成本下的队列网络控制问题，提出的方法在保证网络稳定性的同时实现了接近最优的性能，为这类复杂网络优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks,
where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network
controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those
edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to
make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is
minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off,
however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this
problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the
network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We
show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static
optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques
from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show
that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as
compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs.
Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its
regret is indeed sub-linear.

Motivation: 农村地区人口密度低、地形复杂，传统的群众打包测试方法效果差，需要一种更高效、更安全的网络性能测量方案

Method: 开发UAV基础的测量平台，集成机载计算单元和商业移动调制解调器，通过空中操作收集RAN信号和端到端网络性能指标，使用地理空间映射和统计技术分析数据

Result: 高空位置收到信号功率提升（视线条件改善），但信号质量下降（相邻小区干扰增加）；大部分区域保持可接受信号质量和速率性能；强无线信号并不一定对应一致的空间覆盖

Conclusion: UAV基础平台能够有效测量农村地区移动网络性能，揭示了高空位置对信号性能的复杂影响，为网络优化提供了重要的空间数据支持

Abstract: In this work, we develop a measurement platform to capture mobile network
performance metrics including coverage and quality of service in regions where
conventional coverage testing approaches are frequently time-intensive,
labor-demanding, and occasionally hazardous. Traditionally, crowd-sourcing
methods are used to collect cellular network performance metrics. However,
these approaches are inadequate in rural areas due to low-density population,
and difficult terrain. The platform described here is a UAV-based and is
designed to investigate the mobile network performance through aerial
operations and gather Radio Access Network (RAN) signal alongside end-to-end
network performance metrics. Our platform gathers metrics through the
integration of an onboard computation unit and commercial off-the-shelf
cellular modem. The gathered data are subsequently analyzed and displayed using
geospatial mapping utilities and statistical techniques to deliver key
observations on cellular network performance. Experimental results showed that
the received signal power improves at higher altitudes due to enhanced
line-of-sight (LoS) conditions as expected. However, the signal quality
degrades as a result of increased interference from neighboring cells. The
analysis reveals that for most of the geographic area covered in the initial
experiments the system maintained acceptable signal quality, with adequate
throughput performance for both uplink and downlink communications, while
maintaining satisfactory round-trip time characteristics. Notably, the
experiment showed that a strong radio signal metric for a given cell does not
necessarily translate to consistent spatial coverage across the tested region.

Conclusion: 论文完成了对FTM技术在室内定位领域的系统性评估，总结了最重要的研究成果，并指出了未来需要进一步研究的开放性问题和方向，为该技术的发展和应用提供了重要的参考份案。

Abstract: Indoor positioning is an enabling technology for home, office, and industrial
network users because it provides numerous information and communication
technology (ICT) and Internet of things (IoT) functionalities such as indoor
navigation, smart meter localization, asset tracking, support for emergency
services, and detection of hazardous situations. The IEEE 802.11mc fine timing
measurement (FTM) protocol (commercially known as Wi-Fi Location) has great
potential to enable indoor positioning in future generation devices, primarily
because of the high availability of Wi-Fi networks, FTM's high accuracy and
device support. Furthermore, new FTM enhancements are available in the released
(802.11az) and recently completed (802.11bk) amendments. Despite the multitude
of literature reviews on indoor positioning, a survey dedicated to FTM and its
recent enhancements has so far been lacking. We fill this gap by classifying
and reviewing over 180 research papers related to the practical accuracy
achieved with FTM, methods for improving its accuracy (also with machine
learning), combining FTM with other indoor positioning systems, FTM-based
applications, and security issues. Based on the conducted survey, we summarize
the most important research achievements and formulate open areas for further
research.

Conclusion: 预测边缘服务器处理能力对于识别过载服务器至关重要，考虑队列离散变量的精确估计能有效解决组合挑战，实现最优性能

Abstract: This work considers a parallel task execution strategy in vehicular edge
computing (VEC) networks, where edge servers are deployed along the roadside to
process offloaded computational tasks of vehicular users. To minimize the
overall waiting delay among vehicular users, a novel task offloading solution
is implemented based on the network cooperation balancing resource
under-utilization and load congestion. Dual evaluation through theoretical and
numerical ways shows that the developed solution achieves a globally optimal
delay reduction performance compared to existing methods, which is also
approved by the feasibility test over a real-map virtual environment. The
in-depth analysis reveals that predicting the instantaneous processing power of
edge servers facilitates the identification of overloaded servers, which is
critical for determining network delay. By considering discrete variables of
the queue, the proposed technique's precise estimation can effectively address
these combinatorial challenges to achieve optimal performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种统一的资源管理方法，结合了区域系统、所有权类型和可达性类型的优点，支持任意共享和静态生命周期保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高阶函数语言中静态资源管理的挑战，区域系统、所有权类型和可达性类型都有各自的限制，需要统一它们的优点。

Method: 在可达性类型基础上提出两个新扩展：A<:使用二维存储模型支持细粒度资源跟踪，{A}<:实现词法生命周期控制和静态保证。

Result: 设计了两个新的形式化计算系统，在Rocq中完成了形式化和类型安全性证明，避免了流效感推理的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了不同资源管理方法的优点，提供了灵活的共享模式和静态生命周期控制，保持了高阶函数语言的参数化特性。

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

known about the sources of these datasets in terms of platforms and the RE
activities that were researched with the help of the respective datasets.
[Aims] The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-the-art of the
datasets of mobile apps used in existing RE research. [Method] We carried out a
systematic mapping study by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al.
[Results] Based on 43 selected papers, we found that Google Play and Apple App
Store provide the datasets for more than 90% of published research in RE for
mobile apps. We also found that the most investigated RE activities - based on

Our most important conclusions are: (1) there is a growth in the use of
datasets for RE research of mobile apps since 2012, (2) the RE knowledge for
mobile apps might be skewed due to the overuse of Google Play and Apple App
Store, (3) there are attempts to supplement reviews of apps from repositories
with other data sources, (4) there is a need to expand the alternative sources
and experiments with complimentary use of multiple sources, if the community
wants more generalizable results. Plus, it is expected to expand the research
on other RE activities, beyond elicitation and analysis.

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去对学生编程过程数据的分析主要依赖高级描述统计，无法自动跟踪高级代码表示如抽象语法树在时间上的变化，导致在上下文中分析行为非常繁琐。

Method: 使用两个新算法跟踪解析树节点时间变化，并为无法解析的代码状态构建树表示，然后将这些算法应用于2021年CS1课程的公开键盘数据进行分析。

Result: 发现了新的可观测统计：条件语句和循环内外的代码删除率相似，三分之一的注释掉代码最终会恢复，学生在代码中跳转的频率可能不代表困难。

Conclusion: 跟踪解析树时间变化的能力为理解学生编程打开了新维度，包括代码结构发展的最佳实践、语法构造困难度量化、重构行为和代码内注意力转移等方面的研究。

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

Motivation: 虽然透明性被认为对信任、公平和参与度至关重要，但其与开发者体验的关系仍未得到系统化概念化。本文旨在从开发者中心视角提升对软件生态系统透明性的理解。

Method: 基于先前研究构建SECO-TransDX概念模型，通过Delphi研究法对学术界和业界专家进行调查并精炼模型。模型包含6763个相互关联概念，涵盖条件因素、生态系统程序、产物和关系动态等多个层面。

Result: 建立了SECO-TransDX概念模型，提出了开发者体验驱动的透明性概念。该模型为研究人员提供了未来研究和工具开发的基础，为实践者支持设计更可信赖、以开发者为中心的平台，以提升透明性和促进软件生态系统的长期参与度。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个结构化的视角来审视透明性如何在技术、社会和组织层面上中介开发者体验，为软件生态系统的可持续发展做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable
donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper
presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register
their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and
availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,
and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Guowei Yang,Lin Shi,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VulRTex是一个基于大型语言模型推理能力的漏洞相关issue报告识别方法，通过利用历史issue构建推理数据库，指导LLM对目标issue的富文本信息进行推理分析，在数据集不平衡时表现最佳，比最佳基线方法F1提升11.0%，AUPRC提升20.2%，时间成本降低2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件中存在漏洞，开发者提交的issue报告需要安全从业者手动识别，耗时且存在时间差可能被攻击者利用。现有方法主要关注文本描述，缺乏对issue富文本信息的综合分析。

Method: VulRTex首先利用LLM的推理能力构建漏洞推理数据库，然后检索相关案例生成推理指导，引导LLM对目标issue的富文本信息进行推理分析来识别漏洞。

Result: 在973,572个issue上的实验显示，VulRTex在识别漏洞相关issue和预测CWE-ID方面表现最佳，比最佳基线F1提升11.0%，AUPRC提升20.2%，Macro-F1提升10.5%，时间成本降低2倍。成功识别2024年GitHub issue中的30个新兴漏洞，其中11个获得CVE-ID分配。

Conclusion: VulRTex通过利用LLM的推理能力和富文本信息分析，有效提高了漏洞相关issue的识别性能，具有实际应用价值，能够帮助安全从业者更高效地发现开源软件漏洞。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

TL;DR: 对12种漏洞影响版本识别工具的综合实证研究显示，现有工具准确率不超过45%，存在根本性局限，需要新的方法突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漏洞影响版本识别对补丁修复和风险缓解至关重要，但现有工具在真实环境中的有效性不明确，评估范围狭窄且技术过时。

Method: 构建包含1,128个真实C/C++漏洞的高质量基准，从四个维度系统评估12种代表性工具：漏洞和版本级别的有效性、误报误诊根因分析、对补丁特征的敏感性以及集成潜力。

Result: 研究发现工具准确率最高仅45.0%，主要挑战来自启发式依赖、有限语义推理和僵化匹配逻辑。补丁结构如纯添加和跨文件变更进一步降低性能。集成策略最多提升10.1%但总体准确率仍低于60.0%。

Conclusion: 现有工具存在根本性局限，需要全新的方法突破。研究提供了可操作的见解指导工具开发、组合策略和未来研究方向，并公开了复现代码和基准数据集。

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained
datasets.

### [181] [Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896)
*Zushuai Zhang,Elliott Wen,Ewan Tempero*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 代码异味之间的相互作用会显著增加模块间的依赖关系，导致维护复杂性和成本上升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解代码异味如何相互作用并增加模块间依赖关系，以避免维护时的激涛效应

Method: 对116个开源Java系统进行依赖分析，量化代码异味相互作用对依赖关系的影响

Result: 代码异味对之间相互作用会增加总依赖数量，例如Feature Envy方法与Data Classes相互作用时依赖数量增加了7倍

Conclusion: 开发者应优先处理相互作用的代码异味，而非单独存在的异味

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

*Yuvraj Agrawal*

TL;DR: 本文提出了Auth Shim架构模式，通过外部代理服务解决开源软件缺乏企业级身份验证协议支持的问题，实现OSS工具与企业SSO生态系统的安全集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业广泛采用开源软件，但许多独立工具缺乏对SAML、OIDC等企业级身份验证协议的原生支持，导致安全集成缺口，阻碍了开源创新在企业环境中的应用。

Method: 设计Auth Shim轻量级架构模式，作为外部代理服务充当兼容层，将企业身份提供商的请求转换为目标应用程序的原生会话管理机制。要求目标应用必须提供安全的程序化管理API。

Result: 通过在Adobe的案例研究中实施该模式，成功将流行的OSS BI工具与Okta SAML集成，实现了基于IAM组映射的自动化RBAC，消除了手动用户配置。

Conclusion: Auth Shim模式提供了一个可重用、安全且成本效益高的蓝图，使组织能够在保持安全治理的同时采用开源创新，将任何独立OSS工具集成到企业SSO生态系统中。

Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but
standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,
creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to
embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.

TL;DR: RepoDebug是一个多任务、多语言的仓库级代码调试数据集，包含22种错误子类型，支持8种编程语言和3种调试任务，用于评估LLMs在复杂仓库级调试场景中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调试数据集主要关注函数级代码修复，忽略了更复杂和现实的仓库级场景，导致对LLMs在仓库级调试中面临的挑战理解不完整。

Method: 构建RepoDebug数据集，包含22种错误子类型，支持8种编程语言和3种调试任务，并在10个LLMs上进行评估实验。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现最佳，但在仓库级调试中仍然表现不佳，表明现有LLMs在复杂调试场景中存在局限性。

Conclusion: RepoDebug数据集填补了仓库级代码调试评估的空白，揭示了LLMs在复杂调试任务中的挑战，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PyVul是首个全面的Python包漏洞基准套件，包含1,157个经过开发者验证的漏洞，提供提交和函数级别的标注，准确率达到100%和94%。分析发现Python包漏洞涉及多种编程语言，多语言包更易受攻击，现有检测工具存在显著能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python包作为组织、重用和分发单元存在大量漏洞报告，且Python常与其他语言协作增加了漏洞复杂性，当前漏洞检测工具的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入PyVul基准套件，包含1,157个公开报告的开发者验证漏洞，提供提交和函数级别标注，采用LLM辅助数据清洗方法提高标签准确性。

Result: PyVul达到100%提交级别和94%函数级别准确率，是多语言Python包漏洞的最精确大规模基准。分析显示多语言Python包更容易受到漏洞影响，现有检测工具能力与实际需求存在显著差距。

Conclusion: PyVul为Python包漏洞检测提供了高质量基准，揭示了当前工具的局限性，强调了该领域未来发展的必要性，特别是针对多语言环境下的漏洞检测。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

TL;DR: FaaSGuard是一个专门为开源无服务器环境设计的统一DevSecOps管道，通过在开发生命周期的各个阶段嵌入轻量级安全检查，有效检测和防止关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算虽然简化了基础设施管理，但其短暂执行和细粒度可扩展性等特性带来了独特的安全挑战，特别是在OpenFaaS等开源平台中。现有方法通常只解决DevSecOps生命周期的孤立阶段，缺乏集成化的全面安全策略。

Method: 提出FaaSGuard统一DevSecOps管道，在开发生命周期的规划、编码、构建、部署和监控每个阶段系统性地嵌入轻量级、故障关闭的安全检查，有效应对注入攻击、硬编码密钥和资源耗尽等威胁。

Result: 通过对来自GitHub公共仓库的20个真实无服务器函数进行案例研究验证，结果显示FaaSGuard能够有效检测和防止关键漏洞，表现出高精度（95%）和高召回率（91%），且不会显著干扰现有的CI/CD实践。

Conclusion: FaaSGuard为开源无服务器环境提供了一个有效的集成安全解决方案，通过在DevSecOps全生命周期嵌入安全检查，显著提升了无服务器应用的安全性。

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

*Joonhwi Joo*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个频率派决策理论框架，用于在多臂随机对照试验中选择最佳臂，建立了极小极大后悔最优决策规则，特别针对多元正态奖励分布进行了分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂RCT中，"选择胜者"的简单规则在方差异质时可能不是最优的。需要建立一个理论框架来系统性地处理多臂比较中的方差影响问题。

Method: 开发极小极大后悔(MMR)最优决策规则，通过求解对偶问题得到nature的最不利先验。针对多元正态奖励分布，建立渐近MMR过程，将协方差矩阵估计直接映射到决策边界。

Result: 发现两臂和多臂设计的显著差异：两臂情况下"选择胜者"规则始终最优，而三臂及以上时MMR边界变为非线性，系统性地惩罚高方差臂。方差在两臂比较中无关紧要，但在多臂比较中至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架将经典决策理论扩展到多臂RCT，为同时比较多个策略提供了严格的理论基础和实用工具，特别强调了方差在多臂设计中的关键作用。

Abstract: We develop a frequentist decision-theoretic framework for selecting the best
arm in one-shot, multi-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our approach
characterizes the minimax-regret (MMR) optimal decision rule for any
location-family reward distribution with full support. We show that the MMR
rule is deterministic, unique, and computationally tractable, as it can be
derived by solving the dual problem with nature's least-favorable prior. We
then specialize to the case of multivariate normal (MVN) rewards with an
arbitrary covariance matrix, and establish the local asymptotic minimaxity of a
plug-in version of the rule when only estimated means and covariances are
available. This asymptotic MMR (AMMR) procedure maps a covariance-matrix
estimate directly into decision boundaries, allowing straightforward
implementation in practice. Our analysis highlights a sharp contrast between
two-arm and multi-arm designs. With two arms, the empirical success rule
("pick-the-winner") remains MMR-optimal, regardless of the arm-specific
variances. By contrast, with three or more arms and heterogeneous variances,
the empirical success rule is no longer optimal: the MMR decision boundaries
become nonlinear and systematically penalize high-variance arms, requiring
stronger evidence to select them. This result underscores that variance plays
no role in optimal two-arm comparisons, but it matters critically when more
than two options are on the table. Our multi-arm AMMR framework extends
classical decision theory to multi-arm RCTs, offering a rigorous foundation and
a practical tool for comparing multiple policies simultaneously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的渐近上界只考虑浓度矩阵的最小特征值，无法充分利用多个内生变量不同程度识别的信息，导致检验功效不足。

Method: 推导条件似然比检验在弱工具变量渐近框架下的精确分布，考虑浓度矩阵的所有特征值而非仅最小特征值，并提供计算实现方法。

Result: 相比现有方法，新检验在存在不同程度识别的内生变量时具有显著更高的功效，数值分析证实了功效提升。

Conclusion: 通过考虑浓度矩阵的所有特征值，本文提出的精确渐近分布显著提高了弱工具变量下条件似然比检验的功效，特别是在内生变量识别程度不同的情况下。

Abstract: We derive the exact asymptotic distribution of the conditional
likelihood-ratio test in instrumental variables regression under weak
instrument asymptotics and for multiple endogenous variables. The distribution
is conditional on all eigenvalues of the concentration matrix, rather than only
the smallest eigenvalue as in an existing asymptotic upper bound. This exact
characterization leads to a substantially more powerful test if there are
differently identified endogenous variables. We provide computational methods
implementing the test and demonstrate the power gains through numerical
analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FUND 3.9n国家层面综合评估模型，通过纳入部门特定气候影响函数和参数不确定性分析，计算各国社会碳成本(NSCC)，发现低收入和中等收入国家的NSCC更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全球碳成本估算缺乏国家层面的异质性分析，无法反映不同国家因经济结构、气候敏感性和人口暴露度差异而产生的不同气候影响。

Method: 扩展FUND 3.9区域框架，为198个国家建立部门特定的气候影响函数，进行参数不确定性分析，估算国家社会碳成本。

Result: NSCC和全球总和估计对损害规范和偏好参数高度敏感；与单一部门聚合方法相比，考虑不确定性的分解模型显示低收入和中等收入国家的NSCC更高。

Conclusion: 该模型为适应规划、减缓目标设定和国际气候谈判中的公平负担分担提供了政策相关指标，弥合了全球统一碳定价与国家差异化气候影响之间的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents a refined country-level integrated assessment model, FUND
3.9n, that extends the regional FUND 3.9 framework by incorporating
sector-specific climate impact functions and parametric uncertainty analysis
for 198 individual countries. The model enables estimation of the national
social cost of carbon (NSCC), capturing heterogeneity across nations from
economic structure, climate sensitivity, and population exposure. Our results
demonstrate that both the NSCC and the global sum estimates are highly
sensitive to damage specifications and preference parameters, including the
pure rate of time preference and relative risk aversion. Compared to aggregated
single-sector approaches, the disaggregated model with uncertainty yields
higher values of the NSCC for low- and middle-income countries. The paper
contributes to the literature by quantifying how sector-specific
vulnerabilities and stochastic variability amplify climate damages and reshape
global equity in the distribution of the NSCC. The NSCCs derived from our model
offer policy-relevant metrics for adaptation planning, mitigation target
setting, and equitable burden-sharing in international climate negotiations.
This approach bridges the gap between globally harmonized carbon pricing and
nationally differentiated climate impacts, providing a theoretically grounded
and empirically rich framework for future climate policy design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认证技术中的噪声如何影响不可观测产品质量的双寡头市场中卖家的利润，特别关注噪声认证对市场竞争和利润的复杂影响。

Method: 理论模型分析噪声认证在双寡头竞争中的两种效应，并通过实验验证理论预测，比较准确认证和噪声认证条件下的利润差异。

Result: 风险中性买家时噪声认证降低利润，但损失厌恶买家时噪声认证可能提高利润，实验显示不准确认证处理比准确认证更有利可图，尤其在激烈竞争环境中。

Conclusion: 噪声认证对卖家利润的影响取决于买家风险偏好，损失厌恶可以缓解噪声的负面信息效应，使噪声认证在某些条件下反而能增加利润。

Abstract: This paper studies how noise in certification technology affects seller
profits in a duopoly with unobservable product quality. We identify two
opposing effects of noisy certification. First, it reduces the informativeness
of certification outcomes, homogenizing buyers' beliefs and limiting the scope
for vertical differentiation. Second, it introduces randomness into buyer
perceptions, endogenously generating differentiation between otherwise similar
products. When buyers are risk-neutral, the first effect dominates, reducing
seller profits. However, when buyers are loss averse, the negative impact of
reduced informativeness is mitigated, and noisy certification can increase
profits relative to accurate certification. Experimentally, treatments with
inaccurate certification are more profitable than those with accurate
certification, particularly in settings with intense competition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游业作为经济和城市变革的催化剂得到广泛认可，但其对土地价格的影响仍存在争议，需要更深入的实证研究来解释这种关系。

Method: 使用2021-2024年日本1724个市区的面板数据，以年度游客到达量作为旅游活动的代理指标，采用中介分析和面板阈值回归方法进行研究。

Result: 发现实质性的土地价格上涨集中在少数"超级明星"城市（前5.9%的旅游到达量），而大多数市区影响微小或无影响，显示明显的非线性和空间异质性。

Conclusion: 旅游业对土地价格增长的潜在机制复杂，既可能带来利好也可能增加负担，强调需要推进包容性增长和旅游相关收益公平分配的政策。

Abstract: While tourism is widely regarded as a catalyst for economic and urban
transformation, its effects on land prices remain contested. This study
examines tourism and land prices using a panel of 1,724 Japanese municipalities
from 2021 to 2024, with annual tourist arrivals as a proxy for tourism
activity. Using mediation analysis and panel threshold regression, we show that
sizable land price increases are concentrated in a small group of "superstar"
cities, specifically those in the top 5.9 percent for tourist arrivals, while
most municipalities experience little or no effect. The results highlight
pronounced nonlinearities and spatial heterogeneity in tourism's economic
impact across Japan. The potential mechanisms linking tourism to land price
growth are mixed, with possible benefits for local residents as well as risks
of increased burdens. These findings underscore the need for policies that
promote inclusive growth and an equitable distribution of tourism-related
gains.

dimensional and prove existence of a stationary equilibrium with cutoff
inspection and monotone deception. The sender's mixing pins down a closed-form
total inspection probability at the cutoff, and a finite punishment phase
implements the same cutoffs as termination. We extend to noisy checks, silent
audits, and rare public alarms, preserving the Markov structure and continuity
as transparency vanishes or becomes full. The model yields testable
implications for auditing, certification, and platform governance: tapering
inspections with reputation, bunching of terminations after inspection spurts,
and sharper cutoffs as temptation rises relative to costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究专家在职业声誉考虑下如何做出推荐决策，特别是在需要平衡专业判断和职业发展的情况下。

Method: 建立连续信号环境下的理论模型，专家观察私人信号后给出二元推荐（风险/安全），采用截止规则分析均衡行为。

Result: 发现截止值随声誉增加（声誉保守主义），信息量和先验概率降低截止值，而更强的职业关注提高截止值。成功相关奖金与实验存在一一对应关系。

Conclusion: 理论预测高声誉专家会给出更少的风险建议但条件命中率更高，为委员会和监督提供了可实施的调控手段。

Abstract: We study expert recommendations under career concerns in a continuous signal
environment. An expert observes a private signal about a binary payoff and
recommends risky or safe; recommendations and outcomes are public and affect
reputation and implementation. Equilibrium advice follows a cutoff rule. Under
a mild relative-diagnosticity condition, the cutoff increases with reputation
(reputational conservatism); informativeness and priors lower the cutoff while
stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus provides a
one-to-one mapping to experimentation. The theory predicts fewer risky
recommendations but higher conditional hit rates for high-reputation experts
and yields implementable levers for committees and monitoring.

### [193] [Reputation, Risk, and Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04037)
*Georgy Lukyanov*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文研究了声誉如何影响专家决策保守性，发现结果可见性是关键因素。在对称可见性下，职业关注不会导致保守主义；而增加失败可见性（如注册报告）会削弱高声誉专家的谨慎行为并放松选择。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨声誉机制在专家决策中的作用，特别是了解什么条件下声誉会导致专家采取保守策略，以及何种政策能够逆转这种保守倾向。

Method: 使用两页模型，包含二元信号和结果，分析不同可见性条件下的专家行为。提出了一个必要且充分的局部符号检验方法，不依赖效用曲率假设，并允许信息性安全行动。

Result: 研究发现：1）在无信息性安全选项和对称可见性下，职业关注本身不会产生保守主义；2）增加失败可见性（如注册报告制度）会降低高声誉专家的谨慎程度并放松选择过程。

Conclusion: 结果可见性是调节专家保守行为的关键杠杆，通过调整失败可见性可以有效地影响高声誉专家的决策策略，这为政策设计（如注册报告的推广）提供了理论依据。

Abstract: When does reputation make experts play it safe, and what policy reverses
that? I isolate a single lever - visibility of outcomes. In a two-page model
with binary signals and outcomes, I show: (i) with an uninformative safe option
and symmetric visibility, career concerns alone do not generate conservatism;
(ii) increasing failure visibility (as in Registered Reports) weakens
high-reputation caution and relaxes selection. I provide a
necessary-and-sufficient local sign test, agnostic about utility curvature and
allowing informative safe actions, and an identification map suitable for
staggered RR adoption.

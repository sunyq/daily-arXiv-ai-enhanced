A dual functional factor model structure is adopted with a\nhigh-dimensional factor model for the observed curve time series and a\nlow-dimensional factor model for the latent curves with common trends. A\nfunctional PCA technique is applied to estimate the common stochastic trends\nand functional factor loadings. Under some regularity conditions we derive the\nmean square convergence and limit distribution theory for the developed\nestimates, allowing the dimension and sample size to jointly diverge to\ninfinity. We propose an easy-to-implement criterion to consistently select the\nnumber of common stochastic trends and further discuss model estimation when\nthe nonstationary factors are cointegrated. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations\nand two empirical applications to large-scale temperature curves in Australia\nand log-price curves of S&P 500 stocks are conducted, showing finite-sample\nperformance and providing practical implementations of the new methodology."}

These requirements\nare intended to avoid undesirable group differences and to alleviate concerns\nrelated to transparency. This paper proposes a framework that integrates\nfairness and interpretability into algorithmic decision making by combining\ndata transformation with policy trees, a class of interpretable policy\nfunctions. The approach is based on pre-processing the data to remove\ndependencies between sensitive attributes and decision-relevant features,\nfollowed by a tree-based optimization to obtain the policy. Since data\npre-processing compromises interpretability, an additional transformation maps\nthe parameters of the resulting tree back to the original feature space. This\nprocedure enhances fairness by yielding policy allocations that are pairwise\nindependent of sensitive attributes, without sacrificing interpretability.\nUsing administrative data from Switzerland to analyze the allocation of\nunemployed individuals to active labor market programs (ALMP), the framework is\nshown to perform well in a realistic policy setting. Effects of integrating\nfairness and interpretability constraints are measured through the change in\nexpected employment outcomes. The results indicate that, for this particular\napplication, fairness can be substantially improved at relatively low cost."}

First, we estimated\nexpenditure in Australia for prevention vs treatment pathways to achieve SDG\ntarget 3.4.

For\ncountries not on track to meet SDG3.4 under BAU, we modelled two intervention\nscenarios commencing in 2022 to achieve SDG3.4: (1) prevention via accelerated\nincidence reduction; (2) treatment via accelerated increases in remission and\ndecreases in CFRs. Australian disease expenditure data were input into a PMSLT\nmodel to estimate expenditure changes from 2022 to 2040. Assuming similar\nexpenditure patterns, the method was applied across OECD countries.\n  Findings: In Australia, current trends project a 25% reduction in 40q30 by\n2030, short of the 33.3% SDG3.4 target. Achieving this requires a 2.53\npercentage point (pp) annual acceleration in incidence decline (prevention) or\n1.56pp acceleration in CFR reduction and remission increase (treatment).\nPrevention reduces disease expenditure by 0.72%-3.17% by 2030 and 2040;\ntreatment initially increase expenditure by 0.16%, before reducing it by 0.98%.\nA treatment scenario reducing only CFRs increased expenditure initially;\nincreasing remission alone achieved savings similar to prevention.

Bridging this gap could enable more natural forms of\ncontrol over complex, decentralized systems. In AI and artificial life, recent\nwork explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still\ndepend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,\nlimiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in\nsynthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often\ngenomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be\nguided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or\ncarefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by\nshowing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be\nguided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative\nprompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI\nmodel scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and\nthe former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness\nfunctions or domain-specific prompt design. We show that the evolved system\ngeneralizes to unseen prompts without retraining.

Our benchmark\nreveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the\nprevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals\nsignificant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with\nthe highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\\% success on the\nmore complex task and 70.8\\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform\nthe design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed\ndecisions regarding architectural components and model selection."}

We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent\nanthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish\nbetween agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,\nLLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,\ncurrently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the\nimpression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant\nliterature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,\nhighlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and\ngoal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,\nwhile heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying\ncomputational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Unlike conventional part\nsegmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns\nto produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object\narticulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part\nsegmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different\npart counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks\nto continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to\nshare the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to\nbe recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion\nFusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a\ncontrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of\npart predictions.

Recently, advanced and complex data processing has\ngained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows\ntypically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of\nresource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources\nfor effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is\nchallenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels\namong community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing\noptions. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially\nprocessing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from\nactual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this\ntwo-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the\nworkflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential\nfailures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for\ninitial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.\nIn this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning\nmodels within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and\nDistributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine\nlearning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges\nposed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step.

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}

Traditionally, developers must resolve these warnings manually.\nBecause this process is tedious, developers sometimes ignore warnings, leading\nto an accumulation of warnings and a degradation of code quality. This paper\npresents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to\nautomatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike\nprevious work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead,\nwe adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather\nadditional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the\ncodebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false\npositives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent\nwith a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2)\nverify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3)\nrun the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube\nwarnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our\napproach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate,\nrespectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of\n86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings.\nThe approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end\nprocessing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent\nhelping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines\nto prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings."}

Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training\nan LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact\nthrough controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible\neffect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate\nthis approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical\ndomains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the\nstructure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added\ncomplexity.

Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling\nstatements as \\textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning.

Unlike conventional part\nsegmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns\nto produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object\narticulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch\ndiffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part\nsegmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different\npart counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks\nto continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to\nshare the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to\nbe recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion\nFusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a\ncontrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of\npart predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted\nto 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few\nmanual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K,\na curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from\nObjaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part\nvideo sequences.

In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen.

We propose a scalable, modular framework for\ngenerating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from\nlarge corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA\ncreation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and\nmodel evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from\n22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a\nsuite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions,\ncomparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from\npaper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1.\nWe find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on\nboth synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models\nto surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam."}

Environments are not passive testing\ngrounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit\nvery challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous\ncapacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets\nhas led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the\nstructure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these\nenvironments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This\npaper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief\nstates of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}

The most common way of representing skin\ntone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has\nbeen criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for\nlighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the\ngranularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the\nquestion marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the\nFST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in\nfair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better\nrepresents the diversity of human skin tones."}

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches.

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to\nre-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic\nconstructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away\nfrom the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall\nfunctionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic\napproach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a\nframework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level\nstructure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing\nlower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to\nthe target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different\nways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in\nconjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly,\nskeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual\nfragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically\ntranslated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a\nwhole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of\nskeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show\npromising scalability compared to prior works.

Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling\nsolution with its strong type system, which enforces memory and type safety at\ncompile time without compromising performance. This paper introduces a\ntype-safe communication framework for MPI, built on the RSMPI library, to\naddress the limitations of traditional MPI programming.

The size of KV cache grows linearly as\nthe length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and\ndecoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize\nthe last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV\nimportance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style\ntransfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation\nproblem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate\nthat LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections\nwhen its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach\nefficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only\napproximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection\ngeometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality,\nleft-right consistency, and motion diversity."}

Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained\nvulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the\ndevelopers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large\nvolume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific\nvulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of\nvulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization\nusually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling\nvulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence,\nthe demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at\nthe statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\napproach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via\nmultiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level\nlabels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a\nfunction is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the\nvulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically,\ninspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the\nground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual\nstatements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These\npseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level\nrepresentation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach\nachieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art\nperformance in statement-level vulnerability localization."}

However, learning-based\nmethods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D\nfacial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce\nreliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ\nprojection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model\ntraining. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches\nfrequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse\nfacial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate\nreconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with\nMulti-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained\nimages.

To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning\nframework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this\nframework, we first extract the features individually from the visual and GPS\ncoordinates sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, and subsequently\nfuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best\nline-of-sight links can be proactively established.

In this\npaper, we propose HoloGarment (Hologram-Garment), a method that takes 1-3\nimages or a continuous video of a person wearing a garment and generates\n360{\\deg} novel views of the garment in a canonical pose. Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo.

However,\nRFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and\nvulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric\nidentification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has\nemerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated\nsuccess in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But\ndeep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data\navailability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions\nthat require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this\npaper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle\nidentification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with\nMulti-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This\nmodel offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning\nfrom few data samples without retraining.

Our key insight is to\nbridge the domain gap between real and synthetic data with a novel implicit\ntraining paradigm leveraging a combination of large-scale real video data and\nsmall-scale synthetic 3D data to optimize a shared garment embedding space.\nDuring inference, the shared embedding space further enables dynamic\nvideo-to-360{\\deg} NVS through the construction of a garment \"atlas\"\nrepresentation by finetuning a garment embedding on a specific real-world\nvideo. The atlas captures garment-specific geometry and texture across all\nviewpoints, independent of body pose or motion.

Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models\ndemonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial\nprompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with\nmore advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and\neffective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation."}

The key to solving this problem lies in\navoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes\nduring continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works\ncumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store\nand utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid\ncatastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between\nclasses shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will\ncontinuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in\nknowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve\ndomain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task.\nSpecifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we\nname as \"attribute\". In our framework, we learn a \"key-value\" pair to represent\nan attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value\nis the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each\ncorresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across\ndomains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention\nconsistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and\ncross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting\nwhile mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on\nthree CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.\nCode is available at https://github.com/RyunMi/VisTA."}

To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the\ntarget LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a\npair of responses with varying preference levels.

Traditional approaches to sensor\nselection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical\ncorrelations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We\naddress this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks,\ncontinuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to\nsystematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence\non state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training\nan LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact\nthrough controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible\neffect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate\nthis approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical\ndomains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the\nstructure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added\ncomplexity.

This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich\nrepresentations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs\nthrough cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable\nencoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and\ncan be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the\nperformance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in\ndownstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement\nof $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing\ninput sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining\nstrategy. The implementation is made available."}

To resolve this\ndilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation,\nTrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame\ntracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box\ntrajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs.

To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive\nMixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each\nexpert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal\npattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to\nthe most relevant experts.

On average across the two datasets, VulAgent improves\noverall accuracy by 6.6%, increases the correct identification rate of\nvulnerable--fixed code pairs by up to 450% (246% on average), and reduces the\nfalse positive rate by about 36% compared with state-of-the-art LLM-based\nbaselines."}

In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the\nscale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This\npaper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via\nefficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic\nand highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge\nare proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across\nmultiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The\nprocedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing\ngraph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the\nmemory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both\nlarge-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph\nconstruction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by\ngraph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in\napproximately 17h when only three nodes are employed.

This paper\npresents CodeCureAgent, an approach that harnesses LLM-based agents to\nautomatically analyze, classify, and repair static analysis warnings. Unlike\nprevious work, our method does not follow a predetermined algorithm. Instead,\nwe adopt an agentic framework that iteratively invokes tools to gather\nadditional information from the codebase (e.g., via code search) and edit the\ncodebase to resolve the warning. CodeCureAgent detects and suppresses false\npositives, while fixing true positives when identified. We equip CodeCureAgent\nwith a three-step heuristic to approve patches: (1) build the project, (2)\nverify that the warning disappears without introducing new warnings, and (3)\nrun the test suite. We evaluate CodeCureAgent on a dataset of 1,000 SonarQube\nwarnings found in 106 Java projects and covering 291 distinct rules. Our\napproach produces plausible fixes for 96.8% of the warnings, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baseline approaches by 30.7% and 29.2% in plausible-fix rate,\nrespectively. Manual inspection of 291 cases reveals a correct-fix rate of\n86.3%, showing that CodeCureAgent can reliably repair static analysis warnings.\nThe approach incurs LLM costs of about 2.9 cents (USD) and an end-to-end\nprocessing time of about four minutes per warning. We envision CodeCureAgent\nhelping to clean existing codebases and being integrated into CI/CD pipelines\nto prevent the accumulation of static analysis warnings."}

Recognizing this, we aim to generate images\nfor poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences\nto modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a\nnovel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically\nmodifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By\ndynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or\nsuppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to\nsemantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations.

Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account\nfor the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent\nassessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's\nKappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative\nPrecision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new\nevaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions\nrather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert\ndisagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the\nquality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of\ndiagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result.\nOur evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a\nlimited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being\ntested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In\nthis automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical\ndiagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our\napproach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models\n(LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that\ntop-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or\nexceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments\nexhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and\nhumans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and\nsupports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI."}

Compared to textual documentation, it provides a higher-level\nunderstanding of the system structure and data flow. Developers usually prefer\nvisual representations over lengthy textual descriptions for large software\nsystems. Visual documentation is both difficult to produce and challenging to\nevaluate. Manually creating it is time-consuming, and currently, no existing\napproach can automatically generate high-level visual documentation directly\nfrom code. Its evaluation is often subjective, making it difficult to\nstandardize and automate. To address these challenges, this paper presents the\nfirst exploration of using agentic LLM systems to automatically generate visual\ndocumentation. We introduce VisDocSketcher, the first agent-based approach that\ncombines static analysis with LLM agents to identify key elements in the code\nand produce corresponding visual representations. We propose a novel evaluation\nframework, AutoSketchEval, for assessing the quality of generated visual\ndocumentation using code-level metrics. The experimental results show that our\napproach can valid visual documentation for 74.4% of the samples. It shows an\nimprovement of 26.7-39.8% over a simple template-based baseline.

On two\ndatasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published\nstate-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt.\nmAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and\napplying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining\nwith in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the\nDAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of\nanimal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples.

However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and\nCaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI."}

Existing datasets and\nbenchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and\nspatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric\nreconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain,\nmulti-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld\nconsists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public\ndatasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets,\nOmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more\nrealistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a\nchallenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning\nexisting SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains\nacross 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating\nOmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision\nOmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D\nworld models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the\nphysical world."}

Ni", "Gang Yu", "Heung-Yeung Shum"], "title": "LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence", "comment": null, "summary": "The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core\nbottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on\nweakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This\ncompromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,\nsuppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,\nwe introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for\nMulti-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on\nimplicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit\ncorrespondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the\nattention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable\nfull-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing\ntask. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability\nof models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with\ntext guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:\nopening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects\nlike a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes\nlike moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round\nworkflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the\nDragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual\nquality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only\nestablishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to\nediting paradigms."}

Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by\nconventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme\ndiversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we\npropose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated\ncharacter recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of\nanimated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an\naudio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual\nexemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent\nmulti-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.\nBuilding on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream\napplications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired\naudiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support\nresearch in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated\nmovies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline\ndemonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative\ncomprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.\nFor the code and dataset, visit\nhttps://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/animated_ad/."}

We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary\ngames: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is\nshown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of\nfinite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true\ninfinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how\nchoice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting \"stuck,\" even\nthough every finite approximation converges to equilibrium."}

In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through\nevaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we\ndemonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional\ncorrectness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance\noverhead) is imperceptible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDecoRTL\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5728RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6548\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6216\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u6cd5\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "DecoRTL\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u611f\u77e5\u6e29\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u91cd\u6392\u5019\u9009\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u6839\u636e\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u8c03\u6574\u91c7\u6837\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728VerilogEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDecoRTL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "DecoRTL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728RTL\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents\nrepresent about 20\\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous\nliterature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that\n`true' green patents are about 1\\% less cited by following inventions. In the\nsecond part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a\ndashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union.

Currently, developers most\ncommonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and\nwidely available.

This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to\nsystematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools\noperate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be\ndifficult to learn and write.

We\npresent the design, implementation, and evaluation of an SCM approach for\nKubernetes and empirically show that it has benefits over PCM, as predicted by\na new mathematical model. We compare the service availability of SCM and PCM\nover six experiments using the SockShop benchmark. SCM does not require that\npolling intervals are tuned, and yet detects container failure 86\\% faster than\nPCM and container readiness in a comparable time with limited resource\noverheads.

In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based\nevent stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,\nwe first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input\nevent stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given\ngeneration prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the\npre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously.

While economists often focus on immigrants' economic\noutcomes compared to natives (such as education, labor market success, and\nhealth) social interactions between immigrants and natives are equally crucial.\nThese interactions, from everyday exchanges to teamwork, often lack enforceable\ncontracts and require cooperation to avoid conflicts and achieve efficient\noutcomes. However, socioeconomic, ethnic, and cultural differences can hinder\ncooperation. Thus, evaluating integration should also consider its impact on\nfostering cooperation across diverse groups. This paper studies how priming\ndifferent identity dimensions affects cooperation between immigrant and native\nyouth. Immigrant identity includes both ethnic ties to their country of origin\nand connections to the host country. We test whether cooperation improves by\nmaking salient a specific identity: Common identity (shared society),\nMulticultural identity (ethnic group within society), or Neutral identity. In a\nlab in the field experiment with over 390 adolescents, participants were\nrandomly assigned to one of these priming conditions and played a Public Good\nGame.

Unlike previous approaches relying on task-specific training data,\nour approach uses zero-shot components, including Contrastive Language-Image\nPretraining (CLIP)-based label matching and Qwen-VL for semantic scene\nunderstanding. We further introduce a Multi-Head Probability Fusion (MHPF)\nmodule that dynamically weights modality-specific predictions, followed by a\nCompound Expressions (CE) transformation module that uses Pair-Wise Probability\nAggregation (PPA) and Pair-Wise Feature Similarity Aggregation (PFSA) methods\nto produce interpretable compound emotion outputs. Evaluated under multi-corpus\ntraining, the proposed approach shows F1 scores of 46.95% on AffWild2, 49.02%\non Acted Facial Expressions in The Wild (AFEW), and 34.85% on C-EXPR-DB via\nzero-shot testing, which is comparable to the results of supervised approaches\ntrained on target data.

Deep learning and\ngenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly\nenhance the operation of applications within IoV by facilitating efficient\ndecision-making and predictive capabilities, including intelligent navigation,\nvehicle safety monitoring, accident prevention, and intelligent traffic\nmanagement. Nevertheless, efficiently transmitting and processing the massive\nvolumes of data generated by the IoV in real-time remains a significant\nchallenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable wireless channel\nconditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a semantic\ncommunication framework based on channel perception to improve the accuracy and\nefficiency of data transmission. The semantic communication model extracts and\ncompresses the information to be transmitted. In addition, the wireless channel\nis estimated by using a generative diffusion model, which is employed to\npredict the dynamic channel states, thereby improving the quality of IoV\nservice. In dynamic scenarios, however, the channel estimation performance may\nbe degraded when substantially new scenarios take place, which will adversely\naffect user experience. To mitigate this limitation, we employ a large model to\nfine-tune the channel generation model to enhance its adaptability for varying\nscenarios.

In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for\nnew developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing\nresearch utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of\ncode snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its\narchitectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed\nthe token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach\nthat leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate\nexplanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents\nincorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into\nthe code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach\nusing 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects.

While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits\na periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers\nexploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and\ntracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a\nrange-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are\nextracted for every target. For a single target, the resulting bistatic delays\nare fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric\nposition estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed\nequations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are\nobtained.

Belief-Behavior Consistency in LLM-Based Simulations of Human Trust", "comment": null, "summary": "As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic\ndata for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent\nwith their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs\nabout the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play (\"what they say\")\ncorrespond to their actual behavior during role-play (\"how they act\").\nSpecifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how\nwell beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in\nadvance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust\nGame (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and\nreciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to\nsystematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types\nof beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus\ntask-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;\n(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;\nand (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We\nalso explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors\nin the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research\nobjectives.

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5Meta-Fair\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLLM\u81ea\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08MRs\uff09\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "Meta-Fair\u572812\u4e2aLLM\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea692%\uff0c\u53d1\u73b029%\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u4f30F1-score\u6700\u9ad80.79\u3002", "conclusion": "Meta-Fair\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design.

This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task\n- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade\nperformance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from\nnatural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex\nproblems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will\ninevitably shift.

Typically, satellite or airborne images used\nfor training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where\nthe same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this\npaper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for\ncross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on\nextracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in\nthe independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and\nseparability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch\ntransformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)\nwith semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source\nbranch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and\ntarget domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is\ndeveloped in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain\ncorrelation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed\nto guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we\npropose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to\nfocus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target\nscenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene\nairborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs\nsignificantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.\nIn the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is\nmore than 3\\%$\\sim$5\\% higher than the most advanced method.

Despite\nthe prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture\nnon-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and\nconditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural\npreservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static\nstructures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual\nprocess complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce\nRLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process\ngraphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining\ntheory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively\ncombining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and\nemploys reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to\nautomatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process\ninstance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with\nrelation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next\nactivity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential\nand non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive\nevaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions.

However, applying SAM to\nremote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic\nsegmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,\nViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original\narchitecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts\nclass-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware\nprompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target\nAlignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the\ndomain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,\nenabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive\nexperiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,\nLoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and\nautomatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference\nimages and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViRefSAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfcSAM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3SAM\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ViRefSAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of\nDynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for\ndynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MIMIC-Patient\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cDynamiCare\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8f6e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u4e0d\u7b26\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-III EHR\u6784\u5efaMIMIC-Patient\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDynamiCare\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DynamiCare\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "DynamiCare\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

By minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire\ndiffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and\ngeneration quality.

Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a\n32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5\nof 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms\nother lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model\nsize. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the\nmodel's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n.

To\naddress this, we introduce \\textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for\nautoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local\ntokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.\nBesides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the\nAR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic\ntokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal\nattention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the\nde-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module\nto control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens.

A static feature\nshared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual\nfield provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to\ngenerate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a\nresult, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model\nhighly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only\ndemonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model\nlarger and more complex highly dynamic scenes.

Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where\nobservation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and\nenvironmental.

Finally, we designed several\nchallenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis\nof different methods.

However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated\nmedical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,\nas a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective\nalternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble\nannotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks\nsufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for\ntraining segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

Although these models\nhave unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not\noffer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is\ninherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders\nenables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering\nexplicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an\nencoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,\nwhich learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the\nlatent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the\nlatent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing\nregion-specific cellular patterns in brain images.

Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods\ncan be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the\nfundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a\nconsistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity\nthroughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine\ndetails. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named\nAvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup\npatterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a\ncoarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,\nand then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed\nto generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion\nprocess, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and\nexpressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely\napply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and\nmultiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding\nthe averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)\nmethod that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant\nprompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and\nglaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing\nTTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA.

For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images.

IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination\nmodules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the\npoint of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a \"two-factor\nauthentication (human and IA)\" system, it reduces human error in view\nclassification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.\nAdditionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23\nkey points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and\ndorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.\nExperimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,\nachieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a\npixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm.

We attribute\nthis issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.\nTo address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework\nthat decouples motion information from appearance information.

Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in\npost-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which\nare inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents\nof damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a\nnovel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation\nproblem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected\nareas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity\ndataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged\nstructures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a\nSegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake\nsocial media images.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details.

Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix.

Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent\nnovel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from\nonly sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model\nthat can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics\n(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge\nintegration.

Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames\nindependently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and\nredundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce\nRefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing\ncomplex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and\ndecodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When\ndecoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of\nobjects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head\nmotion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains\nthe legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,\nUCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all\nevaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or\nhigher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using\nRefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only\noutperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,\nacross all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.", "AI": {"tldr": "RefTok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u5e27\u96c6\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165RefTok\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u672a\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRefTok\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Cosmos\u548cMAGVIT\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534736.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "RefTok\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

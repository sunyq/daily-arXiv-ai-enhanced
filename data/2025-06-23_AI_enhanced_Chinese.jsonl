While prior studies have explored these problems in general software\nsystems, their interplay in machine learning (ML)-based projects remains\nlargely underexamined. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of\ncommunity smells and their relationship with SATD in open-source ML projects,\nanalyzing data at the release level. First, we examined the prevalence of ten\ncommunity smell types across the releases of 155 ML-based systems and found\nthat community smells are widespread, exhibiting distinct distribution patterns\nacross small, medium, and large projects. Second, we detected SATD at the\nrelease level and applied statistical analysis to examine its correlation with\ncommunity smells. Our results showed that certain smells, such as Radio Silence\nand Organizational Silos, are strongly correlated with higher SATD occurrences.\nThird, we considered the six identified types of SATD to determine which\ncommunity smells are most associated with each debt category.

Technical Report (Extended Version)", "summary": "Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is a critical aspect of query optimization.\nTraditionally, it leverages statistics built directly over the data. However,\norganizational policies (e.g., regulatory compliance) may restrict global data\naccess. Fortunately, query-driven cardinality estimation can learn CardEst\nmodels using query workloads. However, existing query-driven models often\nrequire access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume\nperfect training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join\ngraphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join\ntemplates are incomplete and imbalanced. We present GRASP, a data-agnostic\ncardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world\nconstraints. GRASP's compositional design generalizes to unseen join templates\nand is robust to join template imbalance.

However, these\nbenchmarks rely on fixed query patterns and fail to capture the real execution\nstatistics of production cloud workloads. Although some cloud database vendors\nhave recently released real workload traces, these traces alone do not qualify\nas benchmarks, as they typically lack essential components like the original\nSQL queries and their underlying databases. To overcome this limitation, this\npaper introduces a new problem of workload synthesis with real statistics,\nwhich aims to generate synthetic workloads that closely approximate real\nexecution statistics, including key performance metrics and operator\ndistributions, in real cloud workloads. To address this problem, we propose\nPBench, a novel workload synthesizer that constructs synthetic workloads by\njudiciously selecting and combining workload components (i.e., queries and\ndatabases) from existing benchmarks. This paper studies the key challenges in\nPBench. First, we address the challenge of balancing performance metrics and\noperator distributions by introducing a multi-objective optimization-based\ncomponent selection method.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u201c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u201d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0cVLM\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790VLM\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9a\u671f\u6ce8\u5165\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u9192\u201d\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684VLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, NC can analyze many scheduling disciplines;\nyet, somewhat surprisingly, an aggregate FIFO server is a notoriously hard case\ndue to its min-plus non-linearity. A resort is to represent the FIFO residual\nservice by a family of functions with a free parameter instead of just a single\ncurve. For simple token-bucket arrival curves, literature provides optimal\nchoices for that free parameter to minimize delay and backlog bounds. In this\npaper, we tackle the challenge of more general arrival curves than just token\nbuckets. In particular, we derive residual service curves resulting in minimal\nbacklog bounds for general piecewise-linear arrival curves. To that end, we\nfirst show that a backlog bound can always be calculated at a breakpoint of\neither the arrival curve of the flow of interest or its residual service curve.\nFurther, we define a set of curves that characterize the backlog for a fixed\nbreakpoint, depending on the free parameter of the residual service curve. We\nshow that the backlog-minimizing residual service curve family parameter\ncorresponds to the largest intersection of those curves with the arrival curve.\nIn more complex scenarios finding this largest intersection can become\ninefficient as the search space grows in the number of flows. Therefore, we\npresent an efficient heuristic that finds, in many cases, the optimal parameter\nor at least a close conservative approximation.

The first optimization\nexploits the observation that many input tuples have the same contribution to\nthe query result, so it is enough to compute the contribution of one of them.\nThe second optimization uses the gradient of the query lineage to compute the\ncontributions of all tuples with the same complexity as for one of them.\nExperiments with a million instances over 3 databases show that our approach\nachieves up to 3 orders of magnitude runtime improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art for queries without aggregates, and that it is practical for\naggregate queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f93\u5165\u5143\u7ec4\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u679c\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eBanzhaf\u548cShapley\u503c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u805a\u5408\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u5982Select-Project-Join-Union\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5143\u7ec4\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u8c31\u7cfb\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5feb3\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For\ncurrent frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having\naccess to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use\nSHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor\n(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign\ntranscripts.

As various blockchain networks continue to\nevolve, we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift in which they could provide\nservices traditionally offered by the Internet, but in a decentralized manner,\nmarking the emergence of the Internet of Blockchains. While significant\nprogress has been achieved in enabling interoperability between blockchain\nnetworks, existing solutions often assume that networks are already mutually\naware.

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt.

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that\nuses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared\nto a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of\nretrieval by an average of 13x (55x).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faREIS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u5185\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff08ISP\uff09\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0cRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u8865\u5145\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709ISP\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u672a\u52a0\u901f\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u4fee\u6539\u590d\u6742\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "REIS\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5e03\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\uff0c2\uff09ISP\u5b9a\u5236\u6570\u636e\u653e\u7f6e\u6280\u672f\uff0c3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684ANNS\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cREIS\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd13\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u654855\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "REIS\u4e3aRAG\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684ISP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While individual requirements can usually be analyzed\nmanually, verifying properties (e.g., satisfiability) over sets of NL\nrequirements is particularly challenging. Formal approaches (e.g., SMT solvers)\nmay efficiently verify such properties, but are known to have theoretical\nlimitations. Additionally, the translation of NL requirements into formal\nconstraints typically requires significant manual effort. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have emerged as an alternative approach for formal\nreasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in verifying requirements over strings\nis less studied. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach that verifies\nthe satisfiability of NL requirements over strings by using LLMs (1) to derive\na satisfiability outcome (and a consistent string, if possible), and (2) to\ngenerate declarative (i.e., SMT) and imperative (i.e., Python) checkers, used\nto validate the correctness of (1). In our experiments, we assess the\nperformance of four LLMs. Results show that LLMs effectively translate natural\nlanguage into checkers, even achieving perfect testing accuracy for\nPython-based checkers. These checkers substantially help LLMs in generating a\nconsistent string and accurately identifying unsatisfiable requirements,\nleading to more than doubled generation success rate and F1-score in certain\ncases compared to baselines without generated checkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SMT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLMs\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff08SMT\u548cPython\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u751f\u6210\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Our evaluations show that our\nmethodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark\nbeating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of\n7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.\nWe note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring\nmulti-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that\nincorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust\nand semantically consistent repairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709APR\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709APR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8865\u4e01\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "SemAgent\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u9694\u79bb\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u4fee\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u9636\u6bb5\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWEBench-Lite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemAgent\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\u4e3a44.66%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7684APR\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u8865\u4e01\u3002"}}

The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients\ndiagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria.

PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using\nDice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance\n(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W\nscans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)\nand 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved\nDSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98\nmm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP).

Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from\nteam communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic\ncommunication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable\ninsights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes\noperational scenarios.

Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its\nsignificant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly\nmodeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this\npaper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the\nself-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,\nharnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we\nfirst ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D\npolyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,\npolyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among\nimage tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the\nstructural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an\nefficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we\nembed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,\nenabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on\nstandard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and\nsegmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art\napproaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our\nproposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K\nsemantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,\nrespectively.

Because of its\nunidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous\nstates and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision\nmethods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward\nscan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a\nfull receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,\neroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To\neliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM\nblock that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward\nselective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on\nLBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan\ndirections every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra\nbackward sweeps.

Existing methods primarily\nrely on the single coarse condition (\\eg, skeleton sequences) as the\nintermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,\nwhich limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that\nincorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.\nRather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,\nSignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent\nfine-grained conditions (\\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP\ncontains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly\ntrained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that\nencapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization\n(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings\ninto discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions.

During inference, Multi-Condition Token\nTranslator first translates the spoken language text into discrete\nmulti-condition tokens.

To overcome this\nchallenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.\nIt conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large\nlanguage models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,\nMeta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,\nself-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this\nstrategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without\nadditional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting\nstrategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including\nself-critique step and refinement step.\n  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework\n$\\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a\njudge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all\nmodels. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases\nhigh-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\\mathrm{H}^2$ scores\nranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across\nevaluated models.

LLM unlearning techniques,\nwhich can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a\npost-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns.\nWhile recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language,\ntheir applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study\nreveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code,\ncause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable\nfor code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning\napproach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively\npreserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability\nof forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate\ndistributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget\nspecific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study,\nwe establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three\ncritical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code\nunlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that\nPROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility\ncompared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while\nconsistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series.\nPROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without\ngenerating or exposing the data to be forgotten.

We\ninvestigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard\nprompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an\nexplicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT\nprompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define\nstructured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt\nengineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,\nstructured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.\nFurthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is\noften based on heuristics from non-domain experts.

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English.

Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend\narchitecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted\nin state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been\nintroduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,\nthereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,\ntheir performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss\nregarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the\nreceptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal\ndensely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip\nconnections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend\narchitecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind\nspots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.\nExperimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly\navailable datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that\nthe proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nmethods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower\nfloating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.\nMoreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes\ndiverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting\nnotable advantages in lipreading systems.

To train the VNPNet,\nwe create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random\nnoise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video\nmodels show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal\nconsistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial\nimprovement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can\nbe applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "FastInit\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982FreeInit\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cFastInit\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FastInit\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff08VNPNet\uff09\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFastInit\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "FastInit\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u3002"}}

To address the lack\nof rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce\nSEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced\nperception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates\ngeneralization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,\ncross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,\nwe find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces\nlogical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%\nconsistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final\nanswers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To\naddress this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing\nboth answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.\nGRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer\ncorrectness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the\nmodel's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)\nagainst group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths\nthat are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with\nthis adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,\nachieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%\nimprovement in consistency.

It is based on a learning paradigm that uses\nself-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random\nnetworks.

With limited\nsupport samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be\nseverely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can\nproduce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual\nnoises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable\nFSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate\nimage and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype\nloss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust\ntask adaptation.

We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption\nis the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal\ninfluence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully\ndesigned natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public\nperception of scientific information has direct connections with the final\nengagement pattern.

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains\ndiagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'\nidentities.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates\narchitectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,\nand supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.\nExperimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity\ncompared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve\ncompetitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform\nbaselines on text-to-speech tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLM-SPT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u6539\u8fdb\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u8fc7\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5e27\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u97f3-\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6807\u51c6\u964d\u5e27\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLM-SPT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u95f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5e27\u7387\u3002", "result": "LM-SPT\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bed\u97f3-\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\uff0c\u6587\u672c-\u8bed\u97f3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "LM-SPT\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u591a\u5e27\u7387\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, the computational overhead of a large number of\nparameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a\ndifferent scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed\nas learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models\nwith it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable\nknowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of\nutilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,\nwhich inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework\ndesigned to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.\nSpecifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the\nmultimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.\nSubsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant\nmodels of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nMM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene\napproaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and\ncomparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm\n(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG\nrequires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8\ntimes pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training\nand fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient\ndeployment across diverse downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MM-LG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5757\u63d0\u53d6CLIP\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709Learngene\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5757\u52a0\u6743\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea62.8\u500d\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c25%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u50a8\u3002", "conclusion": "MM-LG\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this paper, we rethink\nmultimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and\nefficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token\nconcatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a\nlightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by\ninjecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of\nlayer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states\nbased on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while\npreserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational\ncosts. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate\nthat LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also\ndramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs\nby 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half\n- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time\nmultimodal reasoning.

In this work, we\nintroduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming\nto achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known\ninformation scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary\nenhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed\nto learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these\nboundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary\npre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on\nknown category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries\nusing labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided\ndecision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further\nenhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved\npseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown\nclusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval.

All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address\npotential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined\nto use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring.

These\nmoderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the\nlearners' tendency to seek support.

Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due\nto its flexibility and versatility.

To\ntackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask\nsemantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual\ndescriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on\nthis, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image\nfusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is\noptimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.\nSpecifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information\nGenerator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven\nAttentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics\nbased on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based\nfusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask\nsemantics.

By designing multiple\nloss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused\nimage and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation\ninformation of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the\nvisible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of\nINR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and\nachieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate\nqueries.

The latest models can\nproduce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually\nindistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors\nhave been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which\nlimits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to\novercome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really\nmatters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on\nidentifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative\narchitecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize\na specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative\narchitectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are\nunbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a\nnovel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet\ndecomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model\nto exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves\nthe generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for\ncomplex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic\ngenerators.

This capability is foundational in\n3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision\nlearning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached\nhuman-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce\nthe Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly\nevaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor\nscenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated\nas a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for\nexisting vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary\nvision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all\nmodels lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the\nneed for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a\ncomprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across\nmultiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel\nmulti-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision\nmodels and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and\nfindings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of\nrobust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on\ndiscrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node\nconnections.

To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego\ndataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling\nto balance historical and current observations. While large language models can\nsupervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level\ncontrol. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with\nexpert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced\nwith a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights\nmulti-step future actions.

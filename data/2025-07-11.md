### [1] [Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07115)
*Javal Vyas,Mehmet Mercangoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合符号推理与自适应控制的自动化框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）统一处理离散故障恢复规划和连续过程控制，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化学过程日益复杂，劳动力短缺和故障场景多样化，需要新的自动化范式来结合符号推理与自适应控制。

Method: 采用有限状态机（FSMs）作为可解释的操作框架，通过LLM驱动的规划代理提出恢复序列，仿真代理执行并检查每个状态转换，验证-重新提示循环迭代优化无效计划。

Result: 在案例研究1中，GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在180个随机生成的FSMs中实现了100%的有效路径成功率；在案例研究2中，LLM控制器在双加热器实验中表现与经典PID控制相当，但能更好地处理非线性动态。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs可以统一高层次符号规划和低层次连续控制，为化学工程中的语言驱动自动化提供了新方向。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

### [2] [BOOST: Out-of-Distribution-Informed Adaptive Sampling for Bias Mitigation in Stylistic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07134)
*Mridula Vijendran,Shuang Chen,Jingjing Deng,Hubert P. H. Shum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BOOST的新方法，通过动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，解决AI模型在艺术分类中的偏见问题，并在KaoKore和PACS数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在艺术分类中因数据集不平衡导致的偏见问题日益严重，影响公平性和准确性，现有研究多忽视这一关键问题。

Method: 提出BOOST方法，动态调整温度缩放和采样概率，以更公平地表示所有类别。

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上验证，BOOST能有效减少类别偏见并保持高性能。

Conclusion: BOOST是一种平衡性能与公平性的解决方案，适用于艺术领域的AI模型去偏见。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

### [3] [Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935)
*Kiran Tomlinson,Sonia Jaffe,Will Wang,Scott Counts,Siddharth Suri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文分析了生成式AI对经济的影响，通过研究用户与AI的互动活动，计算了各职业的AI适用性得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解AI对经济的广泛影响是社会的关键问题。

Method: 分析了20万条用户与Microsoft Bing Copilot的匿名对话，分类活动并计算AI适用性得分。

Result: 信息收集和写作是最常见的AI辅助活动，计算机、数学、行政支持和销售等职业的AI适用性最高。

Conclusion: AI对知识型职业影响显著，实际使用与预测的AI影响存在差异。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Hwidong Bae,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIBP方法通过状态推断和规则遵守，解决了大语言模型在游戏交易系统中的规则违反问题，显著提升了准确性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在游戏交易系统中存在规则违反问题（如物品幻觉和计算错误），损害玩家信任，需要一种可靠的方法来改进。

Method: 提出State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP)，将交易分解为六个状态，通过上下文感知的物品引用和占位符价格计算实现规则遵守。

Result: 在100次交易对话中，SIBP实现了>97%的状态合规性、>95%的引用准确性和99.7%的计算精度，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SIBP为商业游戏中可信赖的NPC交互提供了实用基础，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with
rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule
violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode
player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable
trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule
adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified
prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and
placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues
demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7%
calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while
outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for
trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.

### [5] [Neurosymbolic Feature Extraction for Identifying Forced Labor in Supply Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07217)
*Zili Wang,Frank Montabon,Kristin Yvonne Rozier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用神经符号方法在稀疏且不可靠的数据中检测供应链中的非法活动，并比较了人工与自动特征提取的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链网络复杂且常涉及非法活动（如假冒零件、强迫劳动），传统机器学习方法需要大量数据，但非法供应链数据稀疏且不可靠。

Method: 采用神经符号方法，提出基于问题树的LLM查询方法，用于识别和量化新闻文章的相关性。

Result: 系统评估了人工与机器分类新闻文章的差异，特别是在强迫劳动相关文章上。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在稀疏数据中检测非法活动具有潜力，问题树方法能有效辅助分类。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Motivation: 旨在通过多智能体系统实现科学研究任务的自动化，减少人工干预，提高效率。

Method: 系统由约30个LLM智能体组成，每个智能体专注于不同任务（如检索科学论文、编写代码、解释结果等），采用规划与控制策略协调工作流，并能本地执行代码。

Result: 成功应用于博士级宇宙学任务（利用超新星数据测量宇宙学参数），在两项基准测试中表现优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: cmbagent展示了多智能体系统在科学研究自动化中的潜力，代码已开源，系统已部署并将在云端提供。

Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks,
cmbagent. The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents
and implements a Planning & Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic
workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a
different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases,
writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and
the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to
carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological
parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark
sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code
is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system
is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.

Result: 结果表明，大型语言模型在多智能体任务中能够有效提升探索效率。

Conclusion: 利用大型语言模型作为专家规划器是多智能体强化学习中高效探索的一种可行方法。

Abstract: Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning

intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to
efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent
operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

### [8] [ViDove: A Translation Agent System with Multimodal Context and Memory-Augmented Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07306)
*Yichen Lu,Wei Dai,Jiaen Liu,Ching Wing Kwok,Zongheng Wu,Xudong Xiao,Ao Sun,Sheng Fu,Jianyuan Zhan,Yian Wang,Takatomo Saito,Sicheng Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViDove是一种基于多模态输入的翻译代理系统，通过结合视觉和上下文背景信息提升翻译质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译代理通常仅限于文本输入，缺乏多模态信息的利用，限制了翻译质量。

Method: ViDove借鉴人类翻译流程，整合多模态记忆系统和长短时记忆模块，结合领域知识提升翻译适应性。

Result: ViDove在字幕生成和通用翻译任务中表现优异，BLEU分数提升28%，SubER提升15%。

Conclusion: ViDove通过多模态输入显著提升翻译质量，并推出新基准DoveBench，推动长视频字幕翻译研究。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

### [9] [On the Impossibility of Separating Intelligence from Judgment: The Computational Intractability of Filtering for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07341)
*Sarah Ball,Greg Gluch,Shafi Goldwasser,Frauke Kreuter,Omer Reingold,Guy N. Rothblum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究大语言模型（LLMs）的安全对齐问题，发现输入和输出过滤存在计算挑战，无法通过外部过滤器实现安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，其可能被滥用于生成有害内容的问题引发关注，研究旨在探索安全对齐的挑战。

Method: 研究输入提示和输出内容的过滤方法，分析其计算效率，并基于密码学假设提出理论证明。

Result: 证明高效过滤输入提示和输出内容在计算上不可行，且外部过滤器无法实现安全对齐。

Conclusion: 安全对齐需结合模型内部设计，仅依赖黑盒访问无法满足需求，智能与判断不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sim-to-Dec框架结合生成模拟和智能决策，显著提升供应链运输的及时交付率和利润。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链运输的高响应性和经济效率是关键目标，受运输模式战略决策影响。

Method: 提出Sim-to-Dec框架，包括生成模拟模块（利用自回归建模）和双感知决策模型（通过端到端优化迭代改进）。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Sim-to-Dec显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec框架满足跨场景泛化、细粒度动态模拟、历史与预测结合的需求，优化运输策略。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

*Zerui Yang,Yuwei Wan,Yinqiao Li,Yudai Matsuda,Tong Xie,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DrugMCTS框架结合RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，用于药物重定位，无需领域微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在科学领域推理受限的问题，克服传统方法的高计算成本或数据利用不足的缺陷。

Method: 整合RAG、多智能体和蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过五个专业智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息。

Result: 在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上，DrugMCTS的召回率和鲁棒性显著优于通用LLM和深度学习基线。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对药物发现中的LLM应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarDojo是一个基于《星露谷物语》的开放生产-生活模拟基准测试，用于评估AI代理在生产和社交互动中的综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少同时评估生产和社交技能，StarDojo旨在填补这一空白。

Method: StarDojo包含1000个任务，涵盖农业、制作、探索、战斗和社交互动五大领域，并提供100个代表性任务子集。

Result: 现有最先进的MLLM代理表现有限，GPT-4.1的成功率仅为12.7%，主要受限于视觉理解和多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: StarDojo为复杂生产-生活环境中的开放代理研究提供了用户友好的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注性能提升，缺乏对LLM学习算法的理论理解，AlgEval填补了这一空白。

Method: 提出AlgEval框架，结合案例研究（如搜索算法），通过注意力模式和隐藏状态分析验证假设。

Result: 揭示了LLM的算法组成及其任务解决方式，为模型可解释性和高效训练提供基础。

Conclusion: AlgEval为理解LLM底层计算提供了系统方法，有望推动更高效的训练和架构设计。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域，错误的解释可能误导决策者，因此需要严格评估规则模型的解释质量。

Method: 开发算法分析规则模型中的负面问题，如冗余和重叠。

Result: 研究发现，广泛使用的规则学习工具会导致规则集出现负面问题。

Conclusion: 规则模型的解释存在潜在问题，需进一步改进工具和方法。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context Pooling的新方法，用于提升GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的性能，首次将图池化应用于知识图谱，并在42/48的实验中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN模型在知识图谱链接预测中表现不佳，尤其是vanilla聚合对性能影响有限，因此需要一种新方法来提升效果。

Method: 引入Context Pooling方法，设计邻居精度和邻居召回两个指标，筛选逻辑相关的邻居用于链接预测，并支持查询特定图的生成。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上应用于两个SOTA模型，42/48的实验设置中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的方法，显著提升了GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的表现。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive

Abstract: This study evaluates fine-tuned Llama 3.2 models for extracting
vaccine-related information from emergency department triage notes to support
near real-time vaccine safety surveillance. Prompt engineering was used to
initially create a labeled dataset, which was then confirmed by human
annotators. The performance of prompt-engineered models, fine-tuned models, and
a rule-based approach was compared. The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter
model outperformed other models in its accuracy of extracting vaccine names.
Model quantization enabled efficient deployment in resource-constrained
environments. Findings demonstrate the potential of large language models in
automating data extraction from emergency department notes, supporting
efficient vaccine safety surveillance and early detection of emerging adverse
events following immunization issues.

Abstract: This paper explores belief inference in credal networks using Dempster-Shafer
theory. By building on previous work, we propose a novel framework for
propagating uncertainty through a subclass of credal networks, namely chains.
The proposed approach efficiently yields conservative intervals through belief
and plausibility functions, combining computational speed with robust
uncertainty representation. Key contributions include formalizing belief-based
inference methods and comparing belief-based inference against classical
sensitivity analysis. Numerical results highlight the advantages and
limitations of applying belief inference within this framework, providing
insights into its practical utility for chains and for credal networks in
general.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanQA是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）几何和空间推理能力的诊断基准，基于结构化室内场景表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在真实世界布局推理中的盲点，推动更准确的空间和几何推理能力研究。

Method: 使用符号化格式（如JSON、XML）编码室内场景，设计多样化问题类型测试度量、拓扑推理及设计约束。

Result: LLMs在浅层查询中表现良好，但在模拟物理约束、保持空间一致性及布局扰动下的泛化能力上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了LLMs在空间推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Motivation: 尽管DPO在语言模型对齐中表现出色，但其理论性质和内在局限性尚未充分研究。本文旨在揭示DPO的敏感性和概率分配问题，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过概率演化的视角分析DPO的动态特性，并提出一个双层优化框架，结合监督微调和增强的DPO目标，引入正则化以稳定优化过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在推理和摘要任务中表现优于标准DPO，提高了推理准确性并更好地对齐输出分布。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，并为更可靠、可解释的语言模型对齐开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Motivation: 研究小提琴尺寸缩减对其轮廓线的影响，填补专家观察未定量研究的空白。

Method: 使用25把小提琴的3D几何网格数据，提取10-20条轮廓线，拟合抛物线曲线参数，计算特征并处理异常值，最终生成数值化轮廓。

Result: 发现几何特征可以一定程度上预测尺寸缩减，其中开口参数β最具预测性。

Conclusion: 尺寸缩减对小提琴轮廓线有显著影响，几何分类方法可行，但需考虑缩减程度的多样性。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

Motivation: 传统基准关注技术能力或避免伤害，而FAI Benchmark旨在衡量AI如何促进人类全面繁荣。

Method: 通过1,229个主客观问题，结合专业LLM评估和几何平均评分，评估28个领先语言模型。

Result: 最高分模型得72/100，但所有模型在信仰与灵性等维度表现不佳。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark为开发支持人类繁荣的AI提供了框架，对AI伦理和评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家模型（MoE）需要大量训练数据和复杂优化，而MoSE通过技能导向的路由机制，减少了计算成本并提升了性能。

Method: MoSE采用技能导向的路由机制，定义和标注特定技能，构建分层技能数据集，并通过单次前向过程整合辅助任务。

Result: MoSE在CODA AD任务中表现优于8B+参数模型，激活模型规模减少至少62.5%。

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向学习和推理，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Motivation: 当前AI依赖大规模模型和数据集，导致环境、经济和伦理成本高昂，限制了可持续性和公平性。

Method: 受生物感官系统启发，提出自适应感知方法，动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度等）。

Result: 实证显示自适应感知让小模型（如EfficientNet-B0）超越大模型（如OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁整合自适应感知到实际应用中，并解决技术和伦理挑战，推动可持续、鲁棒和公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Result: 实验表明，算法能处理非布尔、黑盒和随机系统，且通过增加计算时间可提高精度和全面性。

Conclusion: 该算法为识别实际原因提供了实用且灵活的解决方案，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Motivation: 探讨AI模型性能不平等问题，并挑战主流观点，认为计算资源的边际收益递减将导致模型性能趋同。

Method: 开发模型分析固定分布下计算资源的边际收益递减，并通过基准数据和理论模型验证代理指标的有效性。

Result: 实证数据支持计算资源边际收益递减，表明资源有限的模型性能将接近最佳模型。

Conclusion: AI战略和政策需重新审视，以适应资源有限模型性能提升的趋势。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏见主要源于预训练，而非微调或训练随机性。通过交叉调优实验，揭示了预训练对偏见模式的决定性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs中认知偏见的来源，区分预训练、微调和训练随机性的影响，为未来偏见评估和缓解提供理论依据。

Method: 采用两步因果实验：1）多次微调模型以研究训练随机性对30多种认知偏见的影响；2）引入交叉调优，交换指令数据集以隔离偏见来源。

Result: 训练随机性引入一定变异性，但偏见模式主要由预训练决定。相同预训练骨干的模型表现出更相似的偏见模式。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏见需考虑其预训练起源，这为未来评估和缓解LLMs偏见提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在规范性调查中的响应稳健性，评估其作为人类代理的可靠性。

Method: 测试9种LLMs，应用11种扰动（问题表述和答案选项结构），生成167,000次模拟访谈。

Result: 所有模型均表现出近因偏差，对语义变化和组合扰动敏感；较大模型稳健性更高。

Conclusion: 提示设计和稳健性测试对使用LLMs生成合成调查数据至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗LLMs的安全评估提供了新方法，有助于推动其在医疗领域的安全应用。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in

### [31] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了协作学习中打断行为的重要性，并提出了一种在多组对话环境下识别打断的先进方法，适用于课堂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习中的打断行为对小组互动和知识构建有重要影响，但现有研究多针对单一对话环境，无法应对课堂中多组对话的复杂场景。

Method: 分析了单对话和多组对话环境中的打断检测，开发了一种能应对重叠语音的打断识别方法。

Result: 提出了一种在多组对话中识别打断的先进方法，并揭示了打断在协作互动中的语言和韵律特征。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在多组对话中跟踪打断行为提供了基础，强调了重叠语音的影响。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多代理检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康错误信息的反驳言论，通过整合静态和动态证据，提升了反驳言论的相关性、准确性和时效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究依赖于有限的证据，且对最终输出的控制较少，因此需要一种更有效的方法来生成高质量的反驳言论。

Method: 采用多代理检索增强框架，结合多个LLM优化知识检索、证据增强和响应细化，整合静态和动态证据。

Result: 方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线，并通过消融实验和人类评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量的反驳言论，且细化过程显著提升了质量并获得了人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新模型架构，用于高效处理长文本，解决了Transformer的二次计算复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长文本时的时间和计算资源消耗问题，提升效率和性能。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，利用实时端到端图生成机制处理字符级输入，无需填充或截断，并整合LLM信息。

Result: 模型在文本分类任务中表现出高效性和竞争力，生成的图具有有意义的语义组织结构。

Conclusion: 新模型在保持高效的同时，性能与现有最先进模型相当。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域中AI与人类沟通的挑战，确保内容既个性化又易于理解。

Method: 引入MedReadCtrl框架，通过指令调整控制输出复杂度，并在多个数据集和任务上进行评估。

Result: MedReadCtrl在可读性指令跟随错误率上显著优于GPT-4，并在未见过的临床任务中表现优异，专家更倾向于选择它。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能够将临床内容转化为易于理解的语言，同时保留医学意图，为患者教育和公平获取AI医疗服务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction是一个结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化的流程，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公共驱逐相关SDoH数据集，并在性能上优于GPT-4o和BioBERT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驱逐是健康的社会决定因素（SDoH）之一，但研究不足，且电子健康记录（EHRs）中缺乏结构化编码，限制了其应用。

Method: 结合LLMs、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）构建了SynthEHR-Eviction流程，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态。

Result: SynthEHR-Eviction在驱逐和其他SDoH类别上的Macro-F1得分分别为88.8%和90.3%，优于其他模型，并减少了80%的标注工作量。

Conclusion: 该流程高效、可扩展，适用于其他信息提取任务，为驱逐相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

Conclusion: 压缩时间序列理解到轻量级语言模型是可行的，为开发小型可解释模型奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SAND框架，通过让LLM代理在行动前明确考虑候选动作，解决了现有方法因有限动作空间探索而导致的次优行动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理调优方法（如监督微调或偏好优化）可能因缺乏对替代动作的充分比较而陷入看似合理但次优的行动。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自洽动作采样和执行引导的动作评价，通过基础模型合成逐步动作思考，并利用这些轨迹微调LLM代理。

Result: 在两个代表性交互代理任务中，SAND相比初始监督微调平均提升20%，并优于现有最佳代理调优方法。

Conclusion: SAND框架通过动作审议显著提升了LLM代理的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

TL;DR: RLEP是一种两阶段强化学习框架，通过重放已验证的高质量轨迹来稳定训练并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语言模型在强化学习中训练不稳定和策略漂移的问题。

Method: RLEP分为两阶段：先收集已验证轨迹，然后在训练中重放这些轨迹，结合新生成的数据进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，如AIME-2024准确率从38.2%提升至39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量轨迹，实现了更快的收敛和更强的最终性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our

*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了“机器胡扯”作为大语言模型（LLM）中真实性缺失的框架，并开发了Bullshit Index和分类法来量化与分析。实验发现RLHF和CoT提示会加剧胡扯行为，尤其在政治语境中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM中真实性缺失的广泛现象，揭示其机制，以促进更真实的模型行为。

Method: 提出Bullshit Index和四种胡扯分类法，并在多个数据集（包括新设计的BullshitEval）上进行实证评估。

Result: RLHF显著加剧胡扯，CoT提示放大特定形式（如空话和搪塞）。政治语境中胡扯普遍，以搪塞为主。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING是一种后训练框架，通过从大型语言模型提取任务分解（规划轨迹）并微调小型模型，提升复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用任务分解提升小型开源语言模型的性能，填补了后训练阶段规划结构应用的空白。

Method: 通过监督和强化学习目标，模仿大型模型的规划过程，微调小型模型。

Result: 在GSM8k和MATH基准上平均提升7%，在域外数据集上提升10%-12%。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING能有效提升小型语言模型的任务特定性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，现有方法依赖复杂代码结构导致过拟合，需改进。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，引导模型发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如Qwen2.5-7B提升35.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升LLM推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ORR催化剂对提升燃料电池效率至关重要，但从复杂多样的文献中提取结构化信息具有挑战性。

Method: 采用DyGIE++结合MatSciBERT和PubMedBERT等BERT变体，进行数据标注、模型微调，评估不同模型在NER和RE任务中的表现。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1-score达82.19%，MatSciBERT在RE任务中F1-score为66.10%，领域特定模型优于通用模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定BERT模型在ORR催化剂信息提取中表现优异，为自动化文献分析提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Result: 研究表明LLMs无法执行或验证超出特定复杂度的计算和代理任务。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLMs的能力边界，对实际应用中任务设计具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心理支持需求增加但相关数据集稀缺，尤其是在非英语语言中，需要一种方法生成高质量的心理咨询对话数据。

Method: 利用Dialog Generator和Dialog Modifier两个大型语言模型，前者生成对话，后者优化对话质量，并通过自动和人工审核构建CPsDD数据集。开发了CADSS系统，包含Profiler、Summarizer、Planner和Supporter模块。

Result: 构建了包含68K对话的CPsDD数据集，CADSS在策略预测和情感支持对话任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和系统有效解决了心理支持数据稀缺问题，并在实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Result: 三人对话训练的VAP模型优于基线，但对话类型影响准确性。

Conclusion: VAP可用于三人对话轮流发言预测，未来将整合到语音对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Conclusion: LLM的少样本学习方法在多语言情感任务中高效且适应性强，为标签数据稀缺或不一致时提供了传统微调的有力替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨语言检索在特定领域中的性能问题，尤其是当用户查询和支持文档语言不同时。

Method: 使用真实企业数据集构建基准，系统研究多语言检索行为，并提出一种强制均衡检索的策略。

Result: 检索是跨语言场景中的关键瓶颈，提出的策略显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 改进多语言检索在现实RAG应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL在VLMs中的联合效果，以提升多模态推理能力。

Method: 通过多种训练策略（如两阶段、交替或渐进式训练）和数据混合、模型合并等方法，系统研究SFT和RL的作用。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题性能但导致冗长，RL促进泛化和简洁性；两者结合未实现叠加效果，反而产生权衡。

Conclusion: 需开发更无缝和自适应的方法来充分发挥联合后训练技术的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Motivation: 文档图像机器翻译（DIMT）面临训练数据有限和视觉-文本信息复杂交互的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来提升翻译质量。

Method: 提出M4Doc框架，通过将图像编码器与预训练的MLLM多模态表示对齐，使轻量级DIMT模型学习视觉-文本相关性。推理时绕过MLLM以保持效率。

Result: 实验表明，M4Doc显著提升了翻译质量，尤其在跨领域泛化和复杂文档图像场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: M4Doc通过单模态到多模态对齐，有效解决了DIMT的挑战，为文档图像翻译提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法通过贝叶斯框架显著提升了离散扩散语言模型的性能，且无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Motivation: LLMs的计算需求限制了其在资源受限环境中的部署，因此需要探索压缩方法以平衡效率与性能。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏（KD）从Pythia和Qwen2.5家族中提取学生模型，并在SQuAD和MLQA基准上评估零样本和单样本提示条件下的表现。

Result: 学生模型参数减少57.1%的同时，性能保留超过90%；单样本提示比零样本表现更优。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏结合少量提示可以生成高效且性能强的问答系统，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进检索增强生成（RAG）的方法，强调检索效率的重要性，并展示了通过改进提示和少量训练即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG方法主要关注准确性和召回率，而忽略了检索效率（如检索次数）。本文旨在证明无需大规模微调即可提升RAG性能，并探讨如何通过监督和RL微调降低检索成本。

Method: 1. 使用改进提示的标准ReAct流程；2. 结合监督和RL微调以减少检索次数。

Result: 改进提示的ReAct流程在HotPotQA等基准测试中优于现有方法；监督和RL微调可将检索成本降低近一半，仅需少量训练数据（1000例）。

Conclusion: 无需大规模微调即可提升RAG性能，且通过监督和RL微调可显著降低检索成本，为高效RAG提供了新思路。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Motivation: 语音伪装替换（PCR）已成为中文内容审核的主要障碍，现有方法依赖规则生成的合成数据，忽略了真实用户的创造性。

Method: 研究将PCR分为四类表面形式，构建了包含500个真实案例的数据集，并评估了现有LLM的检测能力，提出了一种基于拼音的提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差，但拼音提示策略显著提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类了中文PCR，揭示了现有检测器的局限性，并提出了一种轻量级改进方法。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Motivation: 传统摘要评估依赖人工参考摘要，耗时且主观。NOIR旨在提供一种自动化、客观的评估方法。

Method: 利用语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，结合摘要长度压缩，量化语义保留与压缩的权衡。

Result: NOIR能有效捕捉摘要的语义保留与长度压缩关系，并与人类感知的摘要质量相关。

Conclusion: NOIR是一种自动化、通用的摘要评估工具，适用于多种摘要任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Motivation: 观察到多头注意力（MHA）的性能随注意力头数量增加而提升，但需保持每个头的隐藏尺寸足够大。因此，如何在增加头和隐藏尺寸的同时最小化参数开销成为研究动机。

Method: 提出SAS方法，通过将低维头表示投影到高维空间，模拟更多头和更大的特征维度，同时引入参数高效注意力聚合（PEAA）控制参数成本。

Result: 在多种数据集和任务上的实验表明，SAS方法显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法在保持模型紧凑性的同时，通过模拟更大模型的行为显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

Method: K2RAG整合了密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要技术，并引入预处理步骤以总结训练数据，从而提升检索质量和效率。

Result: 在MultiHopRAG数据集上，K2RAG实现了0.57的平均答案相似度得分和0.82的第三四分位数相似度，训练时间减少93%，执行速度提升40%，且VRAM需求减少三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面均优于传统RAG实现，为LLMs的知识扩展提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为传输嵌入向量而非原始文本可保护隐私，但Vec2Text证明嵌入向量可被解码重构文本，需进一步验证其影响。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架并扩展实验，包括参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重构测试及嵌入量化防御评估。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下有效，能重构密码等敏感信息，但对输入长度敏感；高斯噪声和量化技术可降低隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用文本嵌入向量，并进一步研究NLP系统的鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference

Conclusion: 为研究人员提供技术路线图，为从业者提供概念框架，奠定法律人工智能新时代的基础。

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

### [62] [Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07808)
*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转信号时序逻辑（STL）公式的语义嵌入，以实现从连续表示到具体逻辑公式的转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将符号知识整合到数据驱动的学习算法中，需要语义一致的连续逻辑公式表示，并且这些表示必须可逆以生成具体需求。

Method: 训练一个Transformer解码器模型，通过STL语法构建的小词汇表，反转语义嵌入并生成有效的逻辑公式。

Result: 模型在1个epoch后即可生成有效公式，10个epoch后能泛化到逻辑语义，并能生成更简单但语义接近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在需求挖掘任务中有效，可直接在语义空间中进行优化。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Motivation: 先前研究主要关注注意力头，本文从技能神经元（特别是重复神经元）的角度研究其对ICL性能的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析重复神经元在不同层深度对ICL性能的影响，并与归纳头进行比较。

Result: 重复神经元对ICL性能的影响因层深度而异，同时提出了减少重复输出并保持强ICL能力的策略。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了重复神经元在ICL中的作用，为优化模型性能提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在简单推理任务中的失败揭示了分布外泛化的挑战，任务简化可能反而降低模型表现。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优中，损失函数仅计算响应标记，忽略提示标记，可能导致性能次优和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出WIT方法，系统研究提示和响应标记的加权对指令调优的影响，并通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，适度加权提示标记和高加权响应标记能显著提升模型性能，并增强对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WIT方法为指令调优提供了更优的损失函数设计，有助于开发更鲁棒和通用的模型。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Motivation: 扩展一元分词方法，利用平行数据中的源语言标记来优化目标语言分词，以提高跨语言语义对齐。

Method: 提出条件一元分词方法，固定源分词器，学习目标分词器以最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 在四种语言对上评估，机器翻译质量未提升，但语言建模困惑度一致降低。

Conclusion: 条件概率估计的二次方扩展导致数据效率瓶颈，可能需要其他参数化方法实现实用跨语言分词。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Motivation: RAG框架在NLP中虽重要，但检索文档中的共指复杂性会引入歧义，影响性能。研究旨在系统分析共指对RAG的影响，以提升知识密集型AI应用的检索和生成能力。

Method: 通过比较不同池化策略在检索任务中的表现，分析共指消解对检索相关性和生成质量的影响，并评估问答任务中不同模型的性能差异。

Result: 共指消解显著提升检索效果和问答性能；均值池化在共指消解后表现最佳；小模型因处理歧义能力有限，从消解中获益更多。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了共指复杂性对RAG的挑战，为优化知识密集型AI应用的检索和生成提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Result: 证明了语义均衡的存在唯一性，提出了处理语义奇点的ϕ-拓扑和Yoneda引理的一致性测试。

Conclusion: 框架兼具数学严谨性和实际应用性，为AI语义嵌入提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

TL;DR: DocCHA是一个基于置信度的模块化框架，通过分解诊断过程为三个阶段，显著提升了对话式健康代理的诊断准确性和症状召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对话式健康代理（CHAs）在多轮推理、症状澄清和透明决策方面表现不足，限制了其在临床诊断中的实际应用。

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分解为症状提取、病史获取和因果图构建三个阶段，每个阶段使用可解释的置信度分数指导自适应提问和决策。

Result: 在两个真实世界的中文咨询数据集上，DocCHA的诊断准确率比基于提示的LLM基线高5.18%，症状召回率提升30%以上。

Conclusion: DocCHA展示了结构化、透明且高效的诊断对话的潜力，为多语言和资源受限环境中的可信LLM临床助手奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中更广泛地应用大型语言模型提供了可能，为未来的模拟自动化发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在工业异常检测中表现不佳，缺乏可解释性和泛化能力，SAGE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SAGE结合SFE和E-DPO，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。

Result: SAGE在零样本和单样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE为工业异常检测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI记忆解决方案功能有限，无法满足个性化、抽象化和长期可靠回忆的需求。

Method: MIRIX采用六种结构化记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库）和多代理框架，支持动态更新与检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA和LOCOMO基准测试中，MIRIX分别实现了35%的准确率提升和85.4%的最优性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型语言模型设定了新标准，并在实际应用中提供了隐私保护功能。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

Motivation: 探讨隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）泛化能力差异的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM和EX-RM的差异，验证其对标记级分布变化的敏感性。

Result: IM-RM在标记级分布变化和同分布情况下泛化能力较差，且与生成任务难度无关。

Conclusion: 设计选择对奖励模型的泛化行为有显著影响，IM-RM的局限性源于其对表面线索的依赖。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedThink-Bench是一个用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）医学推理能力的基准测试，包含500个跨医学领域的问题和专家标注的逐步推理。提出的LLM-w-Ref评估框架结合细粒度推理和LLM自评机制，实验显示其与专家判断高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法在医学推理能力评估上存在不足，缺乏严格且可扩展的基准测试。

Method: 开发MedThink-Bench基准测试和LLM-w-Ref评估框架，利用专家标注的逐步推理和LLM自评机制。

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关，且较小模型（如MedGemma-27B）表现优于大型专有模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为LLM医学推理评估提供了基础工具，推动其在临床实践中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

*Shitian Zhao,Haoquan Zhang,Shaoheng Lin,Ming Li,Qilong Wu,Kaipeng Zhang,Chen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PyVision是一个交互式框架，使多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）能够动态生成、执行和优化基于Python的工具，提升视觉推理任务的灵活性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法受限于预定义工作流和静态工具集，无法满足动态需求。

Method: PyVision框架支持多轮交互，模型可自主生成、执行和优化任务相关的Python工具。

Result: PyVision显著提升性能，如GPT-4.1在V*上提升7.8%，Claude-4.0-Sonnet在VLMsAreBlind-mini上提升31.1%。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型不仅能使用工具，还能创造工具，推动更具自主性的视觉推理发展。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

### [78] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态实体链接（MEL）方法MMoE，通过多级专家混合机制解决现有方法中的提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MEL方法未解决提及歧义和模态内容动态选择问题，限制了性能。

Method: MMoE包含描述感知提及增强模块、多模态特征提取模块及两级专家混合模块，动态选择信息。

Result: 实验表明MMoE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMoE通过动态选择多模态信息，显著提升了MEL性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

*Cristina Mata,Kanchana Ranasinghe,Michael S. Ryoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于协方差的像素-文本损失（CoPT），利用领域无关的文本嵌入学习领域不变特征，在无监督域适应（UDA）分割任务中取得新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语义分割中标注数据难以获取的问题，利用文本的领域无关特性提升UDA性能。

Method: 通过LLM生成领域描述，结合CLIP模型生成文本嵌入，提出CoPT损失函数学习领域不变特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，CoPT模型达到UDA分割任务的新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CoPT通过文本嵌入有效提升UDA分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Recall的对抗性框架，旨在测试图像生成模型（IGMs）在去学习技术中的鲁棒性，揭示了现有方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成模型（如Stable Diffusion）的快速发展，其潜在的有害或侵权内容引发了伦理和法律问题。去学习技术（MU）被提出以解决这些问题，但其鲁棒性尚未充分验证。

Method: Recall通过优化对抗性图像提示，利用扩散模型的多模态条件能力，测试十种先进去学习方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上均优于现有基线方法，揭示了当前去学习机制的漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的去学习解决方案的必要性，以确保生成模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Conclusion: 该综述为生物医学图像分析中的可解释深度学习提供了全面指导，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Result: 强化学习方法在缓解模态冲突导致的幻觉中表现最佳，监督微调方法表现稳定。

Conclusion: 揭示了模态冲突对MLLMs幻觉的影响，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的环境中，自主海上监视和目标船只识别对搜索救援和威胁检测等应用至关重要。

Method: 结合YOLOv8目标检测模型、特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析，通过几何原理定位目标船只。

Result: 在MBZIRC2023竞赛中验证了方法的可行性，并评估了视角对检测精度和定位精度的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法在GNSS不可用环境下具备实际应用潜力，尤其在自主系统中表现良好。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有息肉分割方法依赖额外标注数据或任务相似性，限制了泛化能力。CL-Polyp旨在通过对比学习提升特征提取能力，解决这一问题。

Method: 采用对比学习增强编码器特征提取能力，引入MASPP模块优化多尺度特征融合，以及CA模块改善边界重建。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，IoU指标在Kvasir-SEG和CVC-ClinicDB上分别提升0.011和0.020。

Conclusion: CL-Polyp通过自监督对比学习和轻量级模块设计，显著提升了息肉分割性能，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号在空间细节上的局限性阻碍了图像重建，但通过语义描述作为中介，可以更有效地解码视觉体验。

Method: 使用基于transformer的EEG编码器将脑电信号与多级语义描述对齐，通过对比学习映射到描述嵌入，再结合预训练的潜在扩散模型生成图像。

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码效果，揭示了EEG信号与语义描述的神经认知路径对齐。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的语义中介，能够实现与认知对齐的EEG视觉解码，为神经科学和可解释AI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Method: 综述了32篇视频生成论文，分析了关键架构组件和训练策略，并构建了分类法和比较表。

Result: 提出了一个全面的分类法，比较了不同方法的架构设计和性能特点。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析，为未来长视频生成研究提供了架构和训练策略的参考。

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CSCI的RGB-only方法，利用颜色信息解决衣物更换重识别问题，无需额外标注或模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外模型或标注学习衣物不变特征，资源消耗大。本文探索颜色作为轻量级代理，解决外观偏差。

Method: 提出CSCI方法，利用前景和背景颜色信息，结合S2A自注意力机制分离颜色与身份特征。

Result: 在四个CC-ReID数据集上验证，图像重识别性能提升2.9%-5.0%，视频重识别提升1.0%-2.5%。

Conclusion: 颜色是解决CC-ReID外观偏差的高效低成本方案。

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 活动生物特征识别中，身份线索与运动动态和外观变化交织，增加了特征学习的复杂性。现有方法依赖额外视觉数据（如姿态或轮廓），但提取不准确。

Method: 提出DisenQ（解耦Q-Former），一种统一查询变换器，利用结构化语言指导解耦生物特征、运动和非生物特征。

Result: 在三个基于活动的视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在传统视频识别基准测试中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DisenQ框架有效解决了活动生物特征识别的挑战，展示了在多场景中的优越性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMMs在语言覆盖上存在偏差和不公平输出，缺乏对多语言能力的评估。

Method: 引入LinguaMark基准测试，包含6,875个图像-文本对，评估指标包括偏差、答案相关性和忠实性。

Result: 闭源模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini2.5）整体表现最佳，开源模型（如Gemma3和Qwen2.5）在某些方面表现优异，Qwen2.5在多语言泛化上表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究发布了基准测试和评估代码，以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型视觉语言模型是否真正进行视觉推理，还是依赖表面模式和数据集偏差。

Method: 构建MagiC基准，包含5500个弱监督QA示例和900个人工标注示例，评估15个模型在四个维度上的表现。

Result: 揭示了当前模型在视觉推理中的关键局限性和改进机会。

Conclusion: MagiC为多模态认知评估提供了全面工具，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化数据集创建方法ADIEE，用于训练评分模型以评估指令引导的图像编辑效果，显著提升了开源和专有模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在指令引导图像编辑的自动评估中存在对齐问题、透明度和成本效率不足，且缺乏公开训练数据集。

Method: 通过ADIEE生成大规模数据集（超过100K样本），并微调LLaVA-NeXT-8B模型以解码自定义标记的数值分数。

Result: 评分模型在多个基准测试中优于所有开源VLMs和Gemini-Pro 1.5，显著提升了与人类评分的相关性及比较准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅可作为奖励模型优化编辑选择，还能显著提升现有模型的评估分数，如MagicBrush模型在ImagenHub上的表现提升了8.98%。

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products
using their phones without the hassle of physically putting on real products. A
critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate
synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the
scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we
propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory
for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending
realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic
foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on
e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images,
demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对比强化学习方法，通过训练模型区分连贯图像序列与无关图像，解决了视觉叙事系统中实体身份识别不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事系统（如大型视觉语言模型）在跨帧保持角色和对象身份时表现不佳，导致不一致的引用和幻觉。这是因为模型缺乏明确训练来建立跨帧实体连接。

Method: 采用对比强化学习框架，扩展Story Reasoning数据集以生成合成负例，使用Direct Preference Optimization和双组件奖励函数来优化实体连接行为。

Result: 实验表明，模型在实体识别和连贯性方面有显著提升，如grounding mAP提高14.8%，F1提高17.1%，跨帧实体持续性也有所增强。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉叙事系统中实体身份识别的准确性和连贯性，显著改善了故事结构的质量。

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

Motivation: 解决通用深度补全中大规模标注数据需求高的问题，提出一种标签高效的方法。

Conclusion: PacGDC通过高效数据合成和多样化策略，显著提升了深度补全的泛化性能，减少了对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

TL;DR: PSM方法通过粒子配置量化形状变异性，但缺乏自适应性。本文提出两种机制（邻域对应损失和测地线对应算法）以提高适应性，并在复杂数据集上验证了其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PSM方法无法自动调整粒子配置以适应局部几何特征，限制了复杂解剖变异性建模的准确性。

Method: 引入邻域对应损失和测地线对应算法，以增强粒子配置的自适应性并保持一致性。

Result: 在复杂数据集上验证了方法的有效性和可扩展性，分析了适应性与对应性的权衡，并在表面表示和对应指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的机制显著提高了PSM的自适应性，为复杂解剖形状建模提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

Method: 提出MSAGSM模块，结合多尺度时间扩张和多头空间注意力，增强短长期依赖建模和显著区域聚焦。

Result: 在五个PES基准测试中，MSAGSM显著提升性能，且计算开销小，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MSAGSM是一种轻量级即插即用模块，可广泛集成于2D骨干网络，推动PES领域发展。

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Result: 在DeformingThings4D-skl数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功保留了动物习惯行为，为跨类别运动转移提供了新方法。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Motivation: 无约束照片集合易于获取但存在光照不一致和瞬态遮挡问题，现有方法难以解决。

Method: 集成多维特征嵌入和3D高斯相似性计算，引入Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter平滑异常高斯，并通过SAM掩模计算切割比例。

Result: 实验表明Seg-Wild在分割和重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Seg-Wild为无约束场景的分割和重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

Conclusion: EscherNet++在性能、效率和扩展性上均优于现有方法，适用于快速3D重建和复杂场景处理。

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Conclusion: EPIC是一种高效的多模态交互策略，显著降低了计算成本并保持了高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical

TL;DR: DSANet提出了一种双语义感知网络，通过局部和全局特征的互语义感知提升超声视频分割的噪声鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像因噪声问题对自动化分割提出挑战，需提升噪声鲁棒性。

Method: 引入AFSA模块和LGSA模块，分别通过相邻帧语义感知和局部-全局特征融合增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，分割精度和推理速度均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: DSANet有效解决了超声视频分割中的噪声问题，兼具高精度和高效性。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）的方法，用于检测皮肤病变中的蓝白色面纱（BWV），并通过可解释人工智能（XAI）解释模型决策，显著提升了BWV检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蓝白色面纱（BWV）是诊断黑色素瘤的关键特征，但现有研究对其检测有限。本研究旨在开发一种高效、准确的BWV检测方法，以辅助早期黑色素瘤诊断。

Method: 使用非注释皮肤病变数据集，通过颜色阈值技术生成注释数据集。设计并训练了自定义层的DCNN模型，在多个数据集上进行测试，并应用XAI解释模型决策。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有模型，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Motivation: 现有基于掩码的OoD分割方法存在边界不精确、对象内异常评分不一致和背景噪声导致的假阳性问题，需要改进。

Method: Objectomaly分为三阶段：粗粒度异常评分（CAS）、对象感知评分校准（OASC）和精细边界处理（MBP），结合SAM生成的实例掩码和图像处理技术。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象级先验和边界优化显著提升了OoD分割的精度和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶等安全敏感场景。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的人脸识别系统性能下降，现有基于GAN和扩散模型的恢复方法因缺乏针对性模块而效果有限。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抑制纹理失真和准确重建面部结构方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SFFT和DAFE模块显著提升了恶劣天气下的人脸恢复效果，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的兴起，大量用户上传的视频被用作VOT的训练数据，但数据隐私问题被忽视，许多私人视频未经授权被用于商业模型训练。

Method: 提出了一种生成TUEs的生成框架，并引入时间对比损失，以破坏跟踪器的学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频数据隐私保护方面表现优异，具有强大的跨模型、数据集和时间匹配任务的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了视频数据隐私保护问题，为VOT领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Conclusion: OMA基准和Map Association Transformer框架为混合导航地图关联提供了新的解决方案，提升了自动驾驶车辆的导航能力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有方法将人体姿态表示为抽象图结构，忽略了关节间的物理依赖性，导致学习困难和不真实运动。GGMotion旨在通过分组建模和几何等变性改进这一问题。

Method: 采用分组图网络，结合径向场捕捉时空依赖性，并通过组内和组间交互模块以及等变MLP更新关节特征，同时引入辅助损失监督运动先验。

Result: 在Human3.6M、CMU-Mocap和3DPW基准测试中表现优异，短期运动预测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GGMotion通过分组建模和物理约束的引入，有效提升了运动预测的准确性和物理合理性。

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

Conclusion: MUVOD为动态场景分割提供了基准，并推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

Conclusion: 样条表示方法在保持空间一致性和运动连贯性方面优于现有方法，无需依赖线性混合蒙皮或刚性约束。

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Conclusion: 研究表明，稳健推理的关键在于针对性对齐，而非单纯改进表示学习，为VLM分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

Result: 在低光条件下的弱监督语义分割任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS框架有效解决了低光环境下的语义分割问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The
source codes have been released at:https://github.com/ChunyanWang1/DGKD-WLSS.

from Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature
representations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables
effective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension
constraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture
supports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly
enhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference
method based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering
and adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the
MVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of
97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other
recent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect
detection.

*Wenfeng Jia,Bin Liang,Yuxi Lu,Attavit Wilaiwongsakul,Muhammad Arif Khan,Lihong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOTA是一种多尺度推理策略，结合SegFormer和深度估计模块，实现了高精度的3D洪水测绘，适用于快速灾害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水灾害频发且破坏性大，现有方法在覆盖范围或洪水深度方面存在不足，需要一种更高效、精确的洪水测绘方法。

Method: HOTA通过多尺度重叠分块处理Sentinel-2图像，结合SegFormer模型和DEM差分方法，实现2D洪水掩膜和深度估计。

Result: 在2021年澳大利亚Kempsey洪水案例中，HOTA将IoU从73%提升至84%，边界误差小于0.5米。

Conclusion: HOTA能够生成精确的大范围3D洪水地图，适用于快速灾害响应。

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 是一种基于扩散模型的多视角头发转移框架，首次利用多视角扩散模型实现高质量、视角一致的头发转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在捕捉复杂发型方面表现出色，但在生成一致的多视角输出方面仍有不足，影响了数字人类和虚拟化身等实际应用。

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 在多视角头发转移领域设立了新标杆，代码已开源。

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,
and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the

Motivation: 研究基于图像的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在驾驶场景中对激光雷达扫描的开放词汇分割应用，解决传统方法中标签噪声和稀疏性问题。

Method: 通过整合图像语义标签，增强时空一致性和对图像级增强的鲁棒性，并训练3D网络。

Conclusion: LOSC是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了开放词汇分割的性能。

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如IQ测试或数学竞赛）可能因与训练数据重叠而不可靠，且空间可视化能力未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了SpatialViz-Bench基准测试，包含12个任务和4个子能力，评估了33个先进MLLM模型。

Result: 模型表现差异大，存在反直觉行为（如感知难度与人类直觉不符、2D到3D性能骤降、过度依赖公式推导）。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench揭示了MLLM在空间可视化任务中的不足，填补了领域空白，基准已公开。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，ViLU在失败预测方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ViLU的架构和训练方法在不确定性量化中起关键作用，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

Motivation: 现有视频生成编码方法受限于领域特异性或对高层文本指导的过度依赖，导致运动细节丢失和重建不真实。

Method: 提出T-GVC框架，结合语义感知稀疏运动采样和轨迹对齐损失约束，减少码率并保留关键语义信息。

Result: 实验表明，T-GVC在超低码率下优于传统编解码器和现有端到端方法，且运动控制更精确。

Conclusion: T-GVC为基于几何运动建模的生成视频编码开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

Result: 实验表明，这些策略显著提高了对老年人的识别准确率，尤其是易错表情。

Conclusion: 通过简单的训练调整可以有效缓解年龄偏见，近似的人口统计标签有助于提升大规模情感计算系统的公平性。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Method: 提出MolCLIP，结合细胞视频和分子模态，设计分子辅助CLIP框架和度量学习策略。

Result: 在MitoDataset上，药物识别和MoA识别的mAP分别提升51.2%和20.5%。

Conclusion: MolCLIP通过多模态结合和优化特征学习，显著提升了药物MoA识别的性能。

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED为提升LVLMs的CoT推理忠实性和准确性提供了实用有效的方法。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Conclusion: Tree-Mamba方法显著提升了水下深度估计的准确性，BlueDepth数据集为未来研究提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

TL;DR: TreeBench是一个评估视觉基础推理能力的诊断基准，通过复杂场景中的目标感知、可追踪证据和高阶推理测试模型性能。TreeVGR是一种联合监督定位和推理的训练范式，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如OpenAI-o3在视觉基础推理方面表现突出，但缺乏全面评估这些能力的基准。

Method: 提出TreeBench基准，基于三个原则构建，并开发TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习监督定位和推理。

Result: TreeBench包含405个高难度视觉问答对，先进模型准确率不足60%。TreeVGR显著提升多个基准表现。

Conclusion: 可追踪证据是提升视觉基础推理的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了图像分类中数据集偏移下的校准状态，比较了多种后处理和训练中校准方法，并提出了实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并改进在真实世界数据集偏移下的校准性能，为实践者提供稳健校准的指导。

Method: 比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），在多个自然偏移和分类任务中进行实验。

Result: 发现熵正则化和标签平滑结合效果最佳；后处理校准方法在少量OOD数据下更稳健；新校准方法未必优于简单方法；校准改进常以ID校准下降为代价。

Conclusion: 基础模型微调和集成是最有效的校准方法，结合后处理校准能获得最佳结果。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的局部运动模糊去除方法，通过可训练的模糊区域预测器和帧内运动分析器，显著提升了去模糊效果并降低了计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算资源分配和空间变化模糊模式处理上效率不足，导致局部运动模糊去除效果不佳。

Method: 1. 使用模糊区域预测器识别模糊区域，并在训练中排除清晰区域；2. 通过结构重参数化优化推理计算；3. 开发帧内运动分析器，将像素位移转化为运动轨迹。

Result: 在局部和全局模糊数据集上表现优于现有方法，计算量减少49%。

Conclusion: 该方法在去模糊效果和计算效率上均显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

TL;DR: ViaPT提出了一种基于实例感知的视觉提示调优方法，通过结合数据集级和实例级提示，利用PCA保留关键信息，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法使用固定数据集级提示，导致性能不佳，因为下游数据集差异较大。

Method: 提出ViaPT，为每个输入生成实例感知提示，并与数据集级提示融合，利用PCA保留重要信息。

Result: 在34个数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT为视觉提示调优提供了新的分析和优化范式，平衡了数据集级和实例级知识。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Result: 实验表明CRAFT在跨任务攻击和目标对象改变成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT能有效影响统一VLMs在多任务中的表现，为对抗攻击研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially
influencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有内容拼图求解器在真实场景（如文物或文件碎片重组）中缺乏对干扰的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 引入三种拼图干扰（缺失、边缘腐蚀、内容腐蚀），评估启发式和深度学习求解器的表现。

Result: 标准求解器在干扰下性能迅速下降，但深度学习模型通过数据增强可提升鲁棒性，Positional Diffusion模型表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究为提升真实场景拼图求解器的鲁棒性提供了方向。

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的架构仅适用于2D图像，无法直接扩展到3D体积数据（如CT或MRI扫描），且现有3D方法通常采用复杂策略（如滑动窗口推理），导致推理时间长和实现复杂。

Method: 受SegVol启发，提出了一种简化的3D可提示分割方法，避免了滑动窗口的复杂性。

Result: 该方法减少了推理时间，同时实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了3D分割过程，提高了效率和性能。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减少物体幻觉时存在局限性，如依赖特定解码方法或复杂视觉输入修改。本文发现视觉语言模型在不同VQA数据集中的“Yes”回答比例存在显著不平衡现象，因此提出新方法以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于能量的解码方法，动态选择能量分数最低的隐藏状态层，以减少“Yes”回答比例的偏差并提升性能。

Result: 在三个基准测试（POPE、MME、MMVP）中，该方法显著提升了准确率和F1分数，平均准确率提升4.82%，且“Yes”比例差距平均减少8.81%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够减少视觉语言模型中的偏差，同时提升性能，适用于多种常见模型。

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

Motivation: 早期识别人类活动对安全性和响应性至关重要，事件视觉传感器因其高时间分辨率和低延迟适合此需求，但现有方法在早期预测能力上有限。

Result: 在THU EACT-50数据集上，该方法准确率比之前工作提高2%，并通过早期识别框架验证了其性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在早期活动识别中表现出色，实际应用中如体育动作捕捉展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

Result: 在QVHighlights、TACoS和Charades-STA数据集上达到竞争性或SOTA结果，参数减少73%。

Conclusion: SDST方法在性能和参数效率上均优于现有方法，为VTG任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

TL;DR: SCOOTER是一个开源框架，用于评估无限制对抗攻击的不可感知性，提供统计支持的工具和数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击防御策略无法应对无限制攻击，且缺乏统计显著的人类感知评估方法。

Method: 提出SCOOTER框架，包含众包研究指南、大规模人类与模型对比实验、开源工具和基准数据集。

Result: 实验显示，六种攻击方法均未能生成不可感知的图像，且GPT-4o仅能检测部分攻击。

Conclusion: SCOOTER填补了无限制攻击评估的空白，揭示了自动化视觉系统与人类感知的差异。

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Geometry Forcing的方法，通过几何对齐目标增强视频扩散模型对3D结构的理解，显著提升了生成视频的视觉质量和3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型仅基于原始视频数据训练时，往往无法捕捉有意义的几何感知结构，因此需要弥补模型与物理世界3D本质之间的差距。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing方法，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两种对齐目标，引导模型学习几何感知的潜在表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在相机视角和动作条件视频生成任务中，显著优于基线方法，提升了视觉质量和3D一致性。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing是一种简单有效的方法，能够增强视频扩散模型对3D结构的理解，为生成更真实的视频提供了新思路。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文介绍了S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，用于评估复杂3D场景中的语言引导空间推理分割，旨在解决现有数据集中空间关系理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言研究中，空间推理能力未被充分探索，且现有数据集依赖语义线索而非真实空间关系。

Method: 提出S\textsc{urprise}3D数据集，包含200k+视觉语言对和89k+人工标注的空间查询，避免对象名称的干扰。

Result: 基准测试显示当前先进方法在空间推理任务中表现不佳，凸显了数据集的必要性。

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D和3D-SRS基准套件将推动空间感知AI的发展，促进具身交互和机器人规划。

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG技术在准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力上存在不足，尤其在复杂场景下表现不佳。

Method: 采用3D卷积神经网络，结合差分帧融合模块和时序移位模块，引入动态混合损失函数。

Conclusion: 所提网络在复杂场景下具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著提升了rPPG信号的准确性。

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: STTM是一种无需训练的视频时空令牌合并方法，通过利用视频数据的局部冗余性，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（LLMs）因处理大量时空令牌而面临二次计算复杂度问题，STTM旨在通过合并冗余令牌解决这一问题。

Method: STTM采用从粗到细的搜索策略将视频帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中，STTM表现优于现有令牌减少方法，实现了2倍速度提升（仅0.5%准确率下降）和3倍速度提升（仅2%准确率下降）。

Conclusion: STTM是一种高效且通用的令牌合并方法，适用于视频理解任务，支持KV缓存重用。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了BASIC框架，用于多粒度评估脑视觉解码方法，解决了现有评估协议的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑视觉解码评估协议依赖粗粒度指标，掩盖了模型间差异，缺乏神经科学基础，无法捕捉细粒度视觉差异。

Method: 引入BASIC框架，联合量化解码图像与真实图像的结构保真度、推理对齐和上下文连贯性，包括分层分割指标和多模态大语言模型提取的场景表示。

Result: 在统一评估框架下对多种视觉解码方法进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: BASIC提供了更区分性、可解释和全面的脑视觉解码评估基础。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Synergistic Prompting (SyP)的新框架，用于解决多模态视觉识别中模态缺失的问题，通过动态适配器和协同提示策略显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中多模态数据常存在缺失或不完整，导致性能下降，现有静态提示方法缺乏灵活性和可靠性。

Method: 提出SyP框架，包含动态适配器（动态生成提示）和协同提示策略（结合静态与动态提示）。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的视觉识别数据集上显著优于现有方法，表现出对缺失模态的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SyP框架通过动态和协同策略有效解决了模态缺失问题，具有优越的适应性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

TL;DR: KARL是一种单次自适应图像分词器，基于Kolmogorov复杂度原理，通过单次前向传播预测图像的分词数量，性能与现有自适应分词器相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉表示学习系统使用固定长度表示，忽略了输入数据的复杂度变化，而自适应分词方法通常需要多次编码搜索。

Method: 提出KARL，一种单次自适应分词器，通过预测分词数量并基于重建质量条件停止，训练过程类似逆向强化学习。

Result: KARL在单次操作中性能与现有自适应分词器相当，并分析了编码器/解码器规模、连续/离散分词等因素的扩展规律。

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像分词与算法信息理论的联系，其预测的图像复杂度与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次将Vision Transformers（ViT）应用于无标记肺部肿瘤运动预测，比较了患者特定模型和多患者模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测肺部肿瘤运动对质子治疗中的精确剂量投递至关重要。尽管深度学习在无标记方法中占主导地位，但基于Transformer的架构在此领域尚未被探索。

Method: 使用31名患者的数字重建放射影像（DRRs）训练多患者模型，保留1名患者用于评估。患者特定模型仅使用目标患者的规划数据。两种模型均预测1秒内的肿瘤运动，并评估其性能。

Result: 患者特定模型在规划数据上表现更优，但多患者模型在治疗数据上表现出更强的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可达到可比性能。

Conclusion: ViT架构首次应用于无标记肿瘤运动预测。患者特定模型精度更高，而多患者模型适合时间紧迫的临床环境。

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Method: 提出SimCIS方法，利用高度聚合的图像特征进行查询分配，确保完美对齐以保留对象性，同时引入跨阶段一致性选择和基于视觉查询的重放机制。

Result: SimCIS在多种分割任务、设置、划分和输入数据顺序下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SimCIS是一种简单而强大的基线方法，显著提升了类增量图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷是导致低产量的主要原因之一，现有数据集无法满足真实工业场景的需求。

Method: 构建了包含14,120高分辨率扫描和27,346标注缺陷实例的3D-ADAM数据集，覆盖12类工业表面缺陷。

Result: 评估显示现有方法在该数据集上表现不佳，验证了其挑战性和工业相关性。

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM为开发鲁棒的3D异常检测模型提供了重要基准，有望推动工业应用发展。

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Conclusion: THUNDER为数字病理学领域提供了统一的评估工具，有助于推动模型选择和实际应用。

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的水下图像恢复方法在复杂场景中效果不佳且计算量大，需要一种更高效且能处理复杂几何和深度变化的方法。

Method: 结合预训练的潜在扩散模型和显式场景分解，设计物理基础的水下图像合成管道生成多样化训练数据。

Result: SLURPP在合成和真实数据上表现优异，速度比现有方法快200倍，PSNR提升约3 dB。

Conclusion: SLURPP通过新颖架构和合成数据生成，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能和效率。

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量化SuperPoint CNN的无监督架构，用于高效特征点检测与描述，适用于资源受限的嵌入式平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代导航系统需要精确的位置估计，而VSLAM依赖于可靠的特征点提取。

Method: 采用量化SuperPoint CNN，结合FPGA SoC平台和Brevitas/FINN框架进行优化。

Result: 在FPGA平台上实现54 fps处理640x480图像，性能优于现有方案。

Conclusion: 量化技术和硬件优化显著提升了模型在视觉里程计任务中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CiCi的新型测试时间自适应（TTA）策略，用于远程光电容积描记（rPPG）任务，结合生理学先验知识，利用信号在频域和时间域的一致性与不一致性，提升模型在推理时的自适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG模型在未见过部署环境中的适应性受限于隐私问题和实时调整需求，因此需要一种无需源数据的实时自监督自适应方法。

Method: 基于生理学先验知识，提出CiCi框架，结合频域一致性和时间域不一致性，并引入梯度动态控制机制以减少先验冲突。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在TTA协议下优于现有技术，实现了无需源数据的实时自监督自适应。

Conclusion: CiCi框架在rPPG任务中表现出色，为实时自监督自适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为任务演练和机器人模拟提供逼真的火星景观视频，但火星数据稀缺且与地球图像差异大。

Method: 1) M3arsSynth：从NASA数据重建3D火星环境并渲染视频；2) MarsGen：基于3D结构生成逼真视频。

Result: 方法优于基于地球数据训练的模型，视觉逼真度和3D一致性更高。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效合成高质量火星视频，适用于任务模拟。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准多基于离线固定输入，无法反映真实世界中的动态探索和记忆整合需求，因此设计了OST-Bench。

Method: 通过高效数据收集流程构建1.4k场景和10k问答对，评估模型在在线探索和时空推理中的表现。

Result: 现有模型在复杂时空推理任务上表现不佳，准确率随探索时间和记忆增长而下降。

Conclusion: OST-Bench揭示了模型在在线时空推理中的核心挑战，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP模型在视觉-语言任务中存在绑定问题，研究发现数据属性（如低属性密度、不完整标注和显著性偏差）是关键影响因素，而非批量大小或硬负样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在区分复杂视觉场景时表现不佳，如无法区分颜色和物体的组合，研究旨在探索数据属性对绑定问题的影响。

Method: 使用合成数据集系统分析数据属性（如属性密度、标注完整性和显著性偏差）对CLIP绑定能力的影响。

Result: 发现自然数据的常见属性（如低属性密度和不完整标注）对绑定性能有害，而调整数据属性可使CLIP学习近乎完美的绑定。

Conclusion: 数据属性是解决CLIP绑定问题的关键，而非传统方法（如批量大小或硬负样本）。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了草图驱动的关键点检测问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有VQ-VAEs与VAEs在重建质量上存在较大差距，需改进量化策略以缩小差距。

Result: 在ImageNet和8个零样本基准测试中均达到最佳性能，显著优于SD-VAE。

Conclusion: NickName在重建任务中表现出色，为高清图像处理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD

<details>

Motivation: 理解训练数据中概念组合如何影响CLIP/LMM的性能，特别是常见概念在不常见配对中的表现。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）量化词共现频率，通过合成图像和自然图像编辑实验验证PMI与模型准确性的关系。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性高度相关（r=0.97），且在自然图像中同样显著（r=0.75），LMMs也表现出类似行为。

Conclusion: 多模态模型需要改进组合泛化能力，而非仅依赖训练数据的组合扩展。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Method: 提出数据级算法复杂性攻击方法，证明最优攻击策略是NP难问题，并设计多项式时间近似算法。

Conclusion: 揭示了学习型基数估计器的关键漏洞，提供了理论分析，并提出两种防御措施，为开发鲁棒的优化器提供指导。

Abstract: Learned cardinality estimators show promise in query cardinality prediction,
yet they universally exhibit fragility to training data drifts, posing risks
for real-world deployment. This work is the first to theoretical investigate
how minimal data-level drifts can maximally degrade the accuracy of learned
estimators. We propose data-centric algorithmic complexity attacks against
learned estimators in a black-box setting, proving that finding the optimal
attack strategy is NP-Hard. To address this, we design a polynomial-time
approximation algorithm with a $(1-\kappa)$ approximation ratio. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our attack's effectiveness: on STATS-CEB and IMDB-JOB
benchmarks, modifying just 0.8\% of training tuples increases the 90th
percentile Qerror by three orders of magnitude and raises end-to-end processing
time by up to 20$\times$. Our work not only reveals critical vulnerabilities in
deployed learned estimators but also provides the first unified worst-case
theoretical analysis of their fragility under data updates. Additionally, we
identify two countermeasures to mitigate such black-box attacks, offering
insights for developing robust learned database optimizers.

Method: 引入JOB-Complex基准测试，包含30个SQL查询和近6000个执行计划，用于评估优化器性能。

Result: 传统和学习成本模型在JOB-Complex上性能较差，运行时间比最优计划慢11倍。

Conclusion: JOB-Complex为评估查询优化器提供了更真实的场景，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Query optimization is a fundamental task in database systems that is crucial
to providing high performance. To evaluate learned and traditional optimizer's
performance, several benchmarks, such as the widely used JOB benchmark, are
used. However, in this paper, we argue that existing benchmarks are inherently
limited, as they do not reflect many real-world properties of query
optimization, thus overstating the performance of both traditional and learned
optimizers. In fact, simple but realistic properties, such as joins over string
columns or complex filter predicates, can drastically reduce the performance of
existing query optimizers. Thus, we introduce JOB-Complex, a new benchmark
designed to challenge traditional and learned query optimizers by reflecting
real-world complexity. Overall, JOB-Complex contains 30 SQL queries and comes
together with a plan-selection benchmark containing nearly 6000 execution
plans, making it a valuable resource to evaluate the performance of query
optimizers and cost models in real-world scenarios. In our evaluation, we show
that traditional and learned cost models struggle to achieve high performance
on JOB-Complex, providing a runtime of up to 11x slower compared to the optimal
plans.

Motivation: 数据空间目前仅支持数据资产交换，但实践中需要支持服务，因此需要扩展功能。

Conclusion: 该抽象层为数据空间中的服务开发提供了可行方案，扩展了数据空间的功能。

Abstract: Dataspaces are designed to support sovereign, trusted and decentralized data
exchange between participants forming an ecosystem. They are standardized by
initiatives such as the International Data Spaces Association or Gaia-X and
have gained adoption in several domains such as mobility, manufacturing,
tourism or culture. In dataspaces, participants use connectors to communicate
peer-to-peer. The Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) Connector is a broadly
adopted, open-source implementation that adheres to the standards and is
supported by a large community. As dataspaces in general, it focuses on the
exchange of data assets with associated usage policies and does not support
services. In practice, however, there is demand for dataspace-based services
and conceptual arguments support their inclusion in dataspaces. In this paper,
we propose an abstraction layer for providing generic services within
dataspaces. Adopters can use this layer to easily develop own services,
seamlessly integrated with the existing dataspace technology. Besides, we
present an initial implementation of this service architecture for the EDC
Connector and demonstrate its practical applicability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布式框架依赖可靠连接，导致延迟和扩展性问题，而不可靠连接可能影响模型精度和收敛性。

Method: 采用两阶段防御机制：无偏梯度聚合和有界漂移参数广播，确保梯度估计正确且模型差异可控。

Result: 在LLAMA2 7B模型上实验，容忍10%丢包时困惑度变化不超过0.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了高效通信协议与现代大规模模型训练需求之间的空白，支持在普通或广域网络上进行鲁棒学习。

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

Conclusion: 根据数据主权需求选择合适DLT基础设施对去中心化数据生态系统至关重要。

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

TL;DR: 分析机器学习任务中集体通信行为对网络性能的影响，提出重新设计通信框架和网络拓扑的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习任务中的集体通信操作可能导致网络拥塞和丢包，影响性能，因此需要分析这些模式以优化网络资源配置。

Method: 通过Nvidia集体通信库记录和分析多种模型（如DeepSeek、GPT、Llama等）的通信行为，调整并行度、节点数和模型类型等参数。

Result: 展示了DeepSeek V3推理模型的通信行为数据，包括操作类型、传输大小和请求分布，发现当前通信框架和网络拓扑需改进以适应网络异常。

Conclusion: 需重新设计集体通信框架和网络拓扑，以应对机器学习任务中的网络异常影响。

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Helix Parallelism是一种混合执行策略，通过KV并行和TP/EP并行优化LLM的推理效率，减少延迟并支持更大批次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM扩展到数百万token的KV历史，实时自回归解码面临KV缓存读取和FFN权重访问的瓶颈，现有方法如TP无法高效解决。

Method: 提出Helix Parallelism，结合KV并行和TP/EP并行，通过轻量通信和批次重叠（Helix HOP-B）减少通信开销。

Result: Helix在固定批次下降低TTL达1.5倍，支持32倍更大批次，提升DeepSeek-R1的吞吐-延迟Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: Helix使超长序列实时推理成为可能，显著提升效率。

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at
fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency
budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on
Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

*Zihan Zhang,Leon Wong,Blesson Varghese*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Ampere是一种新型的协作训练系统，通过减少设备计算和通信开销，同时提高模型准确性，优于现有的Split Federated Learning (SFL)系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习(FL)中设备计算成本高和Split Federated Learning (SFL)中通信开销大及非独立同分布(IID)数据下模型准确性低的问题。

Method: 采用单向块间训练和轻量级辅助网络生成方法，减少梯度传输和中间交换，并通过整合激活数据来应对数据异构性。

Result: Ampere在多个CNN和Transformer上表现优异，提升模型准确性高达13.26%，减少训练时间94.6%，通信开销99.1%，设备计算93.13%，并降低准确性标准差53.39%。

Conclusion: Ampere在减少计算和通信开销的同时显著提升模型性能，尤其适用于非IID数据场景。

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

Conclusion: M²-MFP通过创新特征提取和时间建模，有效提升了内存故障预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: As cloud services become increasingly integral to modern IT infrastructure,
ensuring hardware reliability is essential to sustain high-quality service.
Memory failures pose a significant threat to overall system stability, making
accurate failure prediction through the analysis of memory error logs (i.e.,
Correctable Errors) imperative. Existing memory failure prediction approaches
have notable limitations: rule-based expert models suffer from limited
generalizability and low recall rates, while automated feature extraction
methods exhibit suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we
propose M$^2$-MFP: a Multi-scale and hierarchical memory failure prediction
framework designed to enhance the reliability and availability of cloud
infrastructure. M$^2$-MFP converts Correctable Errors (CEs) into multi-level
binary matrix representations and introduces a Binary Spatial Feature Extractor
(BSFE) to automatically extract high-order features at both DIMM-level and
bit-level. Building upon the BSFE outputs, we develop a dual-path temporal
modeling architecture: 1) a time-patch module that aggregates multi-level
features within observation windows, and 2) a time-point module that employs
interpretable rule-generation trees trained on bit-level patterns. Experiments
on both benchmark datasets and real-world deployment show the superiority of
M$^2$-MFP as it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by significant
margins. Code and data are available at this repository:

Abstract: Modern AI workloads such as large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) impose severe demands on memory,
communication bandwidth, and resource flexibility. Traditional GPU-centric
architectures struggle to scale due to growing inter-GPU communication
overheads. This report introduces key AI concepts and explains how Transformers
revolutionized data representation in LLMs. We analyze large-scale AI hardware
and data center designs, identifying scalability bottlenecks in hierarchical
systems. To address these, we propose a modular data center architecture based
on Compute Express Link (CXL) that enables disaggregated scaling of memory,
compute, and accelerators. We further explore accelerator-optimized
interconnects-collectively termed XLink (e.g., UALink, NVLink, NVLink
Fusion)-and introduce a hybrid CXL-over-XLink design to reduce long-distance
data transfers while preserving memory coherence. We also propose a
hierarchical memory model that combines local and pooled memory, and evaluate
lightweight CXL implementations, HBM, and silicon photonics for efficient
scaling. Our evaluations demonstrate improved scalability, throughput, and
flexibility in AI infrastructure.

Conclusion: MuMMI和mini-MuMMI为多尺度建模提供了高效工具，未来可推广至更多领域。

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

TL;DR: KVFlow是一个针对基于LLM的代理工作流程优化的KV缓存管理框架，通过预测代理的未来使用情况，减少缓存未命中和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM系统使用LRU策略管理KV缓存，无法预测代理的未来使用，导致频繁的缓存未命中和计算开销。

Method: KVFlow通过抽象代理执行计划为Agent Step Graph，并估计代理的未来激活时间，实现细粒度的KV缓存管理。同时引入KV预取机制，避免生成过程中的缓存未命中延迟。

Result: KVFlow在单工作流程和多并发工作流程中分别实现了1.83倍和2.19倍的加速。

Conclusion: KVFlow通过工作流程感知的KV缓存管理，显著提升了LLM代理工作流程的效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agentic workflows have become a popular
paradigm for coordinating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks.
To improve serving efficiency, existing LLM systems employ prefix caching to
reuse key-value (KV) tensors corresponding to agents' fixed prompts, thereby
avoiding redundant computation across repeated invocations. However, current
systems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,
which fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches
shortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial
recomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV
cache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the
agent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a
steps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future
activation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node
level, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently
manage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a
fully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required
tensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next
step, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation. Compared to SGLang
with hierarchical radix cache, KVFlow achieves up to 1.83$\times$ speedup for
single workflows with large prompts, and up to 2.19$\times$ speedup for
scenarios with many concurrent workflows.

Method: 使用深度Q网络（DQN）和近端策略优化（PPO）两种深度强化学习算法开发MARLISE，实现动态资源扩展。

Result: 实验表明，MARLISE在管理资源弹性和保持微服务响应时间方面优于启发式方法，并提高了资源效率。

Conclusion: MARLISE为边缘云系统提供了一种高效、动态的资源扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Modern edge-cloud systems face challenges in efficiently scaling resources to
handle dynamic and unpredictable workloads. Traditional scaling approaches
typically rely on static thresholds and predefined rules, which are often
inadequate for optimizing resource utilization and maintaining performance in
distributed and dynamic environments. This inefficiency hinders the
adaptability and performance required in edge-cloud infrastructures, which can
only be achieved through the newly proposed in-place scaling. To address this
problem, we propose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based In-place
Scaling Engine (MARLISE) that enables seamless, dynamic, reactive control with
in-place resource scaling. We develop our solution using two Deep Reinforcement
Learning algorithms: Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). We analyze each version of the proposed MARLISE solution using dynamic
workloads, demonstrating their ability to ensure low response times of
microservices and scalability. Our results show that MARLISE-based approaches
outperform heuristic method in managing resource elasticity while maintaining
microservice response times and achieving higher resource efficiency.

Abstract: Autoscaling GPU inference workloads in Kubernetes remains challenging due to
the reactive and threshold-based nature of default mechanisms such as the
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), which struggle under dynamic and bursty
traffic patterns and lack integration with GPU-level metrics. We present KIS-S,
a unified framework that combines KISim, a GPU-aware Kubernetes Inference
Simulator, with KIScaler, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based
autoscaler. KIScaler learns latency-aware and resource-efficient scaling
policies entirely in simulation, and is directly deployed without retraining.
Experiments across four traffic patterns show that KIScaler improves average
reward by 75.2%, reduces P95 latency up to 6.7x over CPU baselines, and
generalizes without retraining. Our work bridges the gap between reactive
autoscaling and intelligent orchestration for scalable GPU-accelerated
environments.

Conclusion: SPG-MIBO算法为无线定位与感知的联合优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

Conclusion: DAF为资源受限环境提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: The construction of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has
recently attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The 5G
and 6G standards have identified LEO satellite networks as a key component of
future mobile networks. However, due to the high-speed movement of satellites,
ground terminals often experience frequent and high-latency handovers, which
significantly deteriorate the performance of latency-sensitive applications. To
address this challenge, we propose a parallel handover mechanism for mobile
satellite networks that can considerably reduce handover latency. The main idea
is to employ plan-based handovers instead of measurement-based handovers to
avoid interactions between the access and core networks, thereby eliminating
the significant time overhead associated with traditional handover procedures.
Specifically, we introduce a novel network function named the Satellite
Synchronized Function (SSF), which is designed to be fully compliant with the
standard 5G core network. In addition, we propose a machine learning model for
signal strength prediction, coupled with an efficient handover scheduling
algorithm. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate
that our proposed handover scheme can reduce handover latency by 21\times
compared to the standard NTN handover scheme and two other existing handover
approaches, along with significant improvements in network stability and
user-level performance.

Abstract: The integration of wireless power transfer (WPT) with Internet of Things
(IoT) offers promising solutions for sensing applications, but faces
significant challenges when deployed in hard-to-access areas such as
high-temperature environments. In such extreme conditions, traditional fixed
WPT infrastructure cannot be safely installed, and batteries rapidly degrade
due to hardware failures. In this paper, we propose an uncrewed aerial vehicle
(UAV)-assisted data collection and WPT framework for batteryless sensor (BLS)
networks deployed in these challenging environments. Specifically, we consider
a practical scenario where a UAV first transfers energy to BLS nodes via WPT,
enabling these nodes to subsequently transmit their collected data to the UAV
through orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Then, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the fair
data collection volume while minimizing the UAV energy consumption through
joint optimization of transmit power allocation and flight trajectory planning.
Due to the non-convex nature and dynamic characteristics of this problem,
conventional optimization methods prove inadequate. To address these
challenges, we propose an enhanced soft actor-critic algorithm with
parameter-free attention, prioritized experience replay, and value-based reward
centering (SAC-PPV), thereby improving the exploration efficiency and learning
stability of the algorithm in complex WPT scenarios. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms benchmark
algorithms under various network configurations.

Conclusion: ABS框架有效解决了CPN中的服务映射问题，显著提升了资源利用和服务质量。

Abstract: Computing Power Network (CPN) unifies wide-area computing resources through
coordinated network control, while cloud-native abstractions enable flexible
resource orchestration and on-demand service provisioning atop the elastic
infrastructure CPN provides. However, current approaches fall short of fully
integrating computing resources via network-enabled coordination as envisioned
by CPN. In particular, optimally mapping services to an underlying
infrastructure to maximize resource efficiency and service satisfaction remains
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we formally define the service mapping
problem in CPN, establish its theoretical intractability, and identify key
challenges in practical optimization. We propose Adaptive Bilevel Search (ABS),
a modular framework featuring (1) graph partitioning-based reformulation to
capture variable coupling, (2) a bilevel optimization architecture for
efficient global exploration with local optimality guarantees, and (3)
fragmentation-aware evaluation for global performance guidance. Implemented
using distributed particle swarm optimization, ABS is extensively evaluated
across diverse CPN scenarios, consistently outperforming existing approaches.
Notably, in complex scenarios, ABS achieves up to 73.2% higher computing
resource utilization and a 60.2% higher service acceptance ratio compared to
the best-performing baseline.

*Miguel Casasnovas,Marc Carrascosa-Zamacois,Boris Bellalta*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 实验分析Wi-Fi重叠信道竞争对VR流媒体的负面影响，发现不同重叠场景下性能下降，并提出NeSt-VR算法有效缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Wi-Fi网络中重叠信道竞争对VR流媒体性能的影响，以优化网络环境下的VR体验。

Method: 通过实验分析80 MHz信道中部分和完全重叠场景下的竞争效应，并测试NeSt-VR算法的效果。

Result: 增加OBSS数量加剧竞争并降低性能；不同重叠场景影响各异；NeSt-VR能有效缓解性能下降。

Conclusion: Wi-Fi重叠信道竞争显著影响VR流媒体性能，但NeSt-VR算法可有效改善这一问题。

Abstract: This paper experimentally analyzes the negative impact of contention caused
by neighboring Wi-Fi networks operating on overlapping channels on Virtual
Reality (VR) streaming over Wi-Fi, focusing on scenarios of partial and full
channel overlap within an 80 MHz channel. Our results show that (i) increasing
the number of 80 MHz Overlapping Basic Service Sets (OBSSs) intensifies
contention and degrades VR streaming performance; (ii) OBSS activity on the
secondary-sided 40 MHz portion degrades performance more than activity on the
primary-sided 40 MHz portion; (iii) for the same aggregate load, full channel
overlap with two 40 MHz OBSS contenders is less detrimental than partial
overlap with a single high-load 40 MHz contender, but more disruptive than full
overlap with two 80 MHz contenders; and (iv) full channel overlap with two 40
MHz OBSS contenders has a smaller impact on VR streaming under symmetric
traffic loads than under asymmetric loads. Moreover, our results demonstrate
that our previously proposed Network-aware Step-wise adaptive bitrate algorithm
for VR streaming (NeSt-VR) effectively mitigates performance degradation in
OBSS environments, enabling VR streaming under heavier OBSS traffic conditions.

*Ana Rita Ortigoso,Gabriel Vieira,Daniel Fuentes,Luís Frazão,Nuno Costa,António Pereira*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: HaLert是一个基于Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s网状网络的智能城市弹性架构，用于灾难后的应急通信。结合SDN和LoRa网络，实现了稳定且功能全面的通信系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难事件的不可预测性要求现有基础设施能够快速转为应急通信系统，智能城市的密集IoT网络为此提供了潜力。

Method: 提出HaLert架构，结合Wi-Fi HaLow网状网络和SDN技术，支持远程监控与配置，并通过LoRa网络实现控制。

Result: 在真实城市环境中测试，Wi-Fi HaLow网络虽受环境影响但仍稳定，LoRa网络消息成功率高达94.96%。

Conclusion: HaLert架构在灾难场景下表现出色，为智能城市应急通信提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Events such as catastrophes and disasters are, in most cases, unpredictable.
Consequently, reusing existing infrastructures to develop alternative
communication strategies after disasters is essential to minimise the impact of
these events on the population's ability to communicate and promptly receive
alerts from authorities. In this context, the emergence of smart cities,
characterised by dense and geographically distributed IoT networks, presents
significant potential for such reuse. This work proposes HaLert, a resilient
architecture for smart cities based on a Wi-Fi HaLow IEEE 802.11s mesh network,
whose resources can be readily reallocated to support a emergency communication
system to exchange messages (including text, location, image, audio, and video)
between citizens, authorities, and between both parties. To facilitate remote
monitoring and configuration of the network, the architecture incorporates the
SDN (Software-Defined Networking) paradigm, supported by a LoRa controlled
flooding mesh network. A prototype was developed based on this architecture and
tested in a real urban scenario comprising both indoor and outdoor
environments. The results demonstrated that, despite the significant impact of
obstacles, lack of line-of-sight, and terrain slopes on the latency (average
latency between 15 and 54.8 ms) and throughput (upload bitrates between 134 and
726 Kbps and download bitrates between 117 and 682 Kbps) of the Wi-Fi HaLow
network, it remained stable and resilient, successfully providing all
functionalities associated with the HaLert architecture. The tests conducted on
the LoRa network revealed a high average message success rate of 94.96%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用程序等价性不可判定，但通过抽象语句语义，问题变得可判定且实际可行。

Method: 使用（Guarded）Kleene Algebra with Tests（（G）KAT）框架分析命题等价性。

Result: 命题等价性在（G）KAT框架下可判定且实用。

Conclusion: （G）KAT为命题程序等价性提供了有效的分析工具。

Abstract: General program equivalence is undecidable. However, if we abstract away the
semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but
practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else
$f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what
$b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional
equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in
propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene
Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个德语开发者情感分析数据集，填补了现有工具在德语领域的空白，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析工具主要依赖英语数据，缺乏德语领域的资源，影响了德语开发者社区的情感分析研究。

Method: 从德语开发者论坛提取5,949条语句，由四位德语母语学生基于Shaver情感模型标注六种基本情感，并评估标注一致性和可靠性。

Result: 标注过程显示出高一致性和可靠性，数据集有效且稳健。现有德语情感分析工具在软件工程领域表现不足。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了德语开发者情感分析的空白，支持进一步研究和工具优化。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential technique for investigating the emotional
climate within developer teams, contributing to both team productivity and
project success. Existing sentiment analysis tools in software engineering
primarily rely on English or non-German gold-standard datasets. To address this
gap, our work introduces a German dataset of 5,949 unique developer statements,
extracted from the German developer forum Android-Hilfe.de. Each statement was
annotated with one of six basic emotions, based on the emotion model by Shaver
et al., by four German-speaking computer science students. Evaluation of the
annotation process showed high interrater agreement and reliability. These
results indicate that the dataset is sufficiently valid and robust to support
sentiment analysis in the German-speaking software engineering community.
Evaluation with existing German sentiment analysis tools confirms the lack of
domain-specific solutions for software engineering. We also discuss approaches
to optimize annotation and present further use cases for the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强透明度、建立用户信任和确保合规性是可解释性的关键需求，但现有方法难以将用户反馈转化为结构化需求和解释。

Method: 引入工具支持的方法，自动化从用户评论中提取需求和生成解释，并通过工业合作数据集评估效果。

Result: AI生成的需求常缺乏相关性和正确性，但其生成的解释因清晰度和风格更受青睐，但仍需人工验证。

Conclusion: 该研究通过自动化方法、实证分析和公开数据集，推动了软件系统可解释性需求的研究。

Abstract: Explainability has become a crucial non-functional requirement to enhance
transparency, build user trust, and ensure regulatory compliance. However,
translating explanation needs expressed in user feedback into structured
requirements and corresponding explanations remains challenging. While existing
methods can identify explanation-related concerns in user reviews, there is no
established approach for systematically deriving requirements and generating
aligned explanations. To contribute toward addressing this gap, we introduce a
tool-supported approach that automates this process. To evaluate its
effectiveness, we collaborated with an industrial automation manufacturer to
create a dataset of 58 user reviews, each annotated with manually crafted
explainability requirements and explanations. Our evaluation shows that while
AI-generated requirements often lack relevance and correctness compared to
human-created ones, the AI-generated explanations are frequently preferred for
their clarity and style. Nonetheless, correctness remains an issue,
highlighting the importance of human validation. This work contributes to the
advancement of explainability requirements in software systems by (1)
introducing an automated approach to derive requirements from user reviews and
generate corresponding explanations, (2) providing empirical insights into the
strengths and limitations of automatically generated artifacts, and (3)
releasing a curated dataset to support future research on the automatic
generation of explainability requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开发者如何将需求信息用于LLM代码生成，填补这一未充分研究的领域。

Method: 访谈14家公司的18名从业者，分析其使用需求和设计工件的方式。

Result: 需求文档需手动分解并补充设计信息才能用于LLM提示，基础需求工程仍不可或缺。

Conclusion: LLM代码生成仍需传统需求工程支持，研究为自动化需求中心SE任务提供了理论背景。

Abstract: With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation
capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software
engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on
the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this
vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate
requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely
unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how
they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed
LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that
explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our
theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract
for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed
into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and
architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights
that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate
code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to
automating requirements-centric SE tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）在需求工程（RE）中的应用存在不确定性和不可控性，缺乏有效提示方法的指导，阻碍了其可信赖的实现。

Method: 采用Kitchenham和Petersen的二次研究协议，搜索了六个数字图书馆，筛选了867条记录，分析了35项主要研究，并提出了一种混合分类法。

Result: 研究揭示了当前PE4RE的任务、使用的LLM家族和提示类型，并指出了局限性和研究缺口。

Conclusion: 提出了一个逐步路线图，指导如何将临时的PE原型发展为可重复的、面向实践者的工作流程。

Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of prompt
engineering (PE) techniques that can enhance various requirements engineering
(RE) tasks. However, current LLMs are often characterized by significant
uncertainty and a lack of controllability. This absence of clear guidance on
how to effectively prompt LLMs acts as a barrier to their trustworthy
implementation in the RE field. We present the first roadmap-oriented
systematic literature review of Prompt Engineering for RE (PE4RE). Following
Kitchenham's and Petersen's secondary-study protocol, we searched six digital
libraries, screened 867 records, and analyzed 35 primary studies. To bring
order to a fragmented landscape, we propose a hybrid taxonomy that links
technique-oriented patterns (e.g., few-shot, Chain-of-Thought) to task-oriented
RE roles (elicitation, validation, traceability). Two research questions, with
five sub-questions, map the tasks addressed, LLM families used, and prompt
types adopted, and expose current limitations and research gaps. Finally, we
outline a step-by-step roadmap showing how today's ad-hoc PE prototypes can
evolve into reproducible, practitioner-friendly workflows.

Motivation: 太空行业的需求工程复杂且需要高精度，小型组织难以从大量非结构化文档中提取可执行需求。

Method: 采用模块化AI方法，预处理文档、分类、检索相关内容，并用LLM生成需求草案。

Result: 初步结果显示该方法能减少人工工作，提高需求覆盖率，并支持轻量级合规对齐。

Conclusion: 论文提出了AI在需求工程中更广泛应用的路线图，旨在降低小型组织参与大型关键任务的门槛。

Abstract: Requirements engineering (RE) in the space industry is inherently complex,
demanding high precision, alignment with rigorous standards, and adaptability
to mission-specific constraints. Smaller space organisations and new entrants
often struggle to derive actionable requirements from extensive, unstructured
documents such as mission briefs, interface specifications, and regulatory
standards. In this innovation opportunity paper, we explore the potential of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to support and (semi-)automate
requirements generation in the space domain. We present a modular, AI-driven
approach that preprocesses raw space mission documents, classifies them into
semantically meaningful categories, retrieves contextually relevant content
from domain standards, and synthesises draft requirements using large language
models (LLMs). We apply the approach to a real-world mission document from the
space domain to demonstrate feasibility and assess early outcomes in
collaboration with our industry partner, Starbound Space Solutions. Our
preliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,
improve coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance
alignment. We outline a roadmap toward broader integration of AI in RE
workflows, intending to lower barriers for smaller organisations to participate
in large-scale, safety-critical missions.

Motivation: 探讨在有限和无限时间范围内，如何识别模型中的时间偏好参数。

Method: 通过多项式方程组求解当前偏差和标准折扣因子，并利用数据确定系数。

Result: 折扣因子通常可识别，但难以精确估计，因排除限制未能很好地捕捉偏好反转特征。

Conclusion: 模型在理论上可识别，但实际估计存在挑战。

Abstract: We study the identification of dynamic discrete choice models with
sophisticated, quasi-hyperbolic time preferences under exclusion restrictions.
We consider both standard finite horizon problems and empirically useful
infinite horizon ones, which we prove to always have solutions. We reduce
identification to finding the present-bias and standard discount factors that
solve a system of polynomial equations with coefficients determined by the data
and use this to bound the cardinality of the identified set. The discount
factors are usually identified, but hard to precisely estimate, because
exclusion restrictions do not capture the defining feature of present bias,
preference reversals, well.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效整合分散数据，为数据有限的国家提供实时经济监测工具。

Abstract: This paper develops a high-frequency economic indicator using a Bayesian
Dynamic Factor Model estimated with mixed-frequency data. The model
incorporates weekly, monthly, and quarterly official indicators, and allows for
dynamic heterogeneity and stochastic volatility. To ensure temporal consistency
and avoid irregular aggregation artifacts, we introduce a pseudo-week structure
that harmonizes the timing of observations. Our framework integrates dispersed
and asynchronous official statistics into a unified High-Frequency Economic
Index (HFEI), enabling real-time economic monitoring even in environments
characterized by severe data limitations. We apply this framework to construct
a high-frequency indicator for Ecuador, a country where official data are
sparse and highly asynchronous, and compute pseudo-weekly recession
probabilities using a time-varying mean regime-switching model fitted to the
resulting index.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电价预测中具有显著优势，尤其在复杂市场环境下，同时揭示了新加坡电力市场的供需动态和监管影响。

Abstract: With stakeholder-level in-market data, we conduct a comparative analysis of
machine learning (ML) for forecasting electricity prices in Singapore, spanning
15 individual models and 4 ensemble approaches. Our empirical findings justify
the three virtues of ML models: (1) the virtue of capturing non-linearity, (2)
the complexity (Kelly et al., 2024) and (3) the l2-norm and bagging techniques
in a weak factor environment (Shen and Xiu, 2024). Simulation also supports the
first virtue. Penalizing prediction correlation improves ensemble performance
when individual models are highly correlated. The predictability can be
translated into sizable economic gains under the mean-variance framework. We
also reveal significant patterns of time-series heterogeneous predictability
across macro regimes: predictability is clustered in expansion, volatile market
and extreme geopolitical risk periods. Our feature importance results agree
with the complex dynamics of Singapore's electricity market after de
regulation, yet highlight its relatively supply-driven nature with the
continued presence of strong regulatory influences.

Result: 右翼选民极化逐步加剧，左翼选民极化先稳定后急剧上升；选举后左翼极化减少，右翼极化增加。该方法还能识别极化变化最大的分歧点。

Conclusion: 该极化测量方法有效且灵活，可用于分析极化趋势及其与其他现象的关系。

Abstract: This paper introduces a definition of ideological polarization of an
electorate around a particular central point. By being flexible about the
location or width of the center, this measure enables the researcher to analyze
polarization around any point of interest. The paper then applies this approach
to US voter survey data between 2004 and 2020, showing how polarization between
right-of-center voters and the rest of the electorate was increasing gradually,
while polarization between left-wingers and the rest was originally constant
and then rose steeply. It also shows how, following elections, polarization
around left-wing positions decreased while polarization around right-wing
positions increased. Furthermore, the paper shows how this measure can be used
to find cleavage points around which polarization changed the most. I then show
how ideological polarization as defined here is related to other phenomena,
such as affective polarization and increased salience of divisive issues.

Motivation: 探讨投票成本水平如何影响民主选举结果，特别是中等成本是否会导致选举结果与多数人偏好不一致。

Method: 研究标准二元多数决策模型，分析党派选民和非党派选民在不同投票成本下的行为及其对选举结果的影响。

Result: 高或低投票成本下，多数偏好的选项总能获胜；中等成本时，选举结果可能偏离多数人偏好。

Conclusion: 民主制度应避免中等投票成本的制度安排，以维护多数原则。

Abstract: Which level of voting costs is optimal in a democracy? This paper argues that
intermediate voting costs - what we term a "Midcost democracy" - should be
avoided, as they fail to ensure that electoral outcomes reflect the preferences
of the majority. We study a standard binary majority decision in which a
majority of the electorate prefers alternative A over alternative B. The
population consists of partisan voters, who always participate, and
non-partisan voters, who vote only when they believe their participation could
be pivotal, given that voting entails a cost. We show that the probability of
the majority-preferred alternative A winning is non-monotonic in the level of
voting costs. Specifically, when voting costs are either high or negligible,
alternative A wins in all equilibria. However, at intermediate cost levels,
this alignment breaks down. These findings suggest that democratic systems
should avoid institutional arrangements that lead to moderate voting costs, as
they may undermine the majority principle.

Motivation: 解决多对一匹配市场中夫妻偏好可能违反响应性时的稳定匹配问题，为实际匹配机制设计提供理论支持。

Method: 分两阶段：1. 假设机构共享共同偏好，分析夫妻偏好对稳定匹配的影响；2. 放宽假设，仅要求机构对夫妻成员有共同排名，进一步研究稳定匹配条件。

Result: 1. 在机构共享共同偏好时，给出了稳定匹配存在的充要条件；2. 在较弱假设下，提供了稳定匹配存在的充分条件。

Conclusion: 研究为多对一匹配市场中夫妻偏好的复杂性提供了理论框架，并为实际匹配机制的设计提供了指导。

Abstract: We study many-to-one matching problems between institutions and individuals,
where each institution may be matched to multiple individuals. The matching
market includes couples, who view pairs of institutions as complementary.
Institutions' preferences over sets of individuals are assumed to satisfy
responsiveness, whereas couples' preferences over pairs of institutions may
violate responsiveness.
  In this setting, we first assume that all institutions share a common
preference ordering over individuals, and we establish: (i) a complete
characterization of all couples' preference profiles for which a stable
matching exists, under the additional assumption that couples violate
responsiveness only to ensure co-location at the same institution, and (ii) a
necessary and sufficient condition on the common institutional preference such
that a stable matching exists when couples may violate responsiveness
arbitrarily.
  Next, we relax the common preference assumption, requiring institutions to
share a common ranking only over the members of each couple. Under this weaker
assumption, we provide: (i) a complete characterization of all couples'
preferences for which a stable matching exists, and (ii) a sufficient condition
on individuals' preferences that guarantees the existence of a stable matching.

Abstract: This paper studies matching markets where institutions are matched with

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用深度学习自动编码器压缩工业X射线计算机断层扫描（XCT）数据的方法，并分析了不同压缩率和网络架构对数据恢复质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着成像技术的发展，数据量急剧增加，需要高效可靠的存储解决方案。

Method: 采用两种网络架构（D-CNN和VQ-VAE）和不同压缩率，对砂岩样本的XCT数据进行压缩和恢复，并引入边缘保留敏感指标评估质量。

Result: 不同架构和压缩率对数据恢复质量有显著影响，需根据后续分析需求选择合适方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为科学家选择数据存储和分析策略提供了参考。

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: GridTD是一种高效且先进的压缩成像重建方法。

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

Conclusion: 多模态数据融合框架为ccRCC的临床决策提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑血管病理对认知衰退和神经系统疾病有重要影响，但现有评估工具在定量分析和标准化验证方面存在不足。

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

### [1] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时序逻辑的AI智能体行为监控语言，用于检测LLM智能体系统中的行为异常，重点关注工具调用序列和状态转换而非具体文本输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在LLM智能体系统中很脆弱，因为LLM输出的自然语言变异性很大。需要一种独立于具体文本输出的行为验证方法。

Method: 使用时序逻辑技术监控智能体的执行轨迹，包括工具调用和状态转换，通过时序表达式定义正确的行为模式。这些断言可用于验证提示工程和护栏效果，以及提供回归测试。

Result: 在三智能体系统测试中，使用大型模型时所有时序断言都得到满足，但使用较小模型时出现行为违规（主要是工具序列不当和协调交接失败），时序表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI智能体可靠性监控提供了系统化基础，特别适用于关键应用中的生产系统行为回归检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [2] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LATTS的自适应测试时扩展方法，通过验证器模型在生成过程中动态调整计算资源分配，实现更好的准确率-计算效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的验证器方法在测试时对所有样本和生成步骤采用均匀计算分配，不考虑个体实例的复杂性，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS方法在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受标准来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型得出的局部难度概念动态调整每步计算量。

Result: 实证结果显示LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算效率权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配策略，有效解决了现有验证器方法计算效率低下的问题，为大语言模型的下游任务性能优化提供了更高效的计算范式。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation
protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that
respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper
reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and

model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers
alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [5] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的重构框架，用于动态验证和组装时间触发系统的调度方案，解决消息碰撞、优先级处理错误等问题，确保系统安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间触发系统在动态运行环境中面临消息碰撞、优先级处理错误导致的死锁、以及生成不完整或无效调度等挑战，这些都会影响系统安全性和性能。

Method: 提出重构框架，通过系统化地将AI生成或启发式得到的调度优先级转换为完全可执行的调度方案，包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制来处理硬件故障等意外事件。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了一种实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，即使在高度动态和不确定的运行条件下也能实现可靠灵活的实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [6] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种集成在元调度器中的自适应在线学习单元，通过强化学习在运行时动态扩展多调度图，解决传统离线训练方法在处理复杂概率空间时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练AI调度推理面临构建全面多调度图的挑战，因为考虑所有可能场景（如硬件故障、松弛变化、模式变化）的概率空间构建过程资源密集且不可行。离线训练只能关注最可能和最关键的情境事件子集。

Method: 在元调度器中集成自适应在线学习单元，使用强化学习模型在在线模式下持续探索和发现新的调度解决方案，动态扩展多调度图。多个RL模型被实现以解决特定调度挑战。

Result: 在线学习单元通过实时训练不断优化AI推理，使系统能够更有效地处理意外事件和复杂调度场景，在引入更严格截止时间或新性能标准时优化现有调度器。

Conclusion: 该方法使系统保持灵活性，能够满足不断变化的需求，确保在大规模安全关键环境中的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [7] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于肌电假手控制的新型识别系统，通过检测污染信号来减轻污染对分类质量的不利影响。系统包含两个集成：用于评估单个通道污染程度的一类分类器集成和用于识别患者意图的K近邻分类器集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假肢通常使用肌电生物信号进行模式识别控制，但生物信号易受污染影响，这会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。

Method: 开发了一个统一的模糊模型，包含两个集成：一类分类器集成用于检测信号污染，K近邻分类器集成用于意图识别。整个识别过程采用统一的软决策方案。

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行了实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了比较分析，并与文献中的类似系统进行了对比。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测污染信号并提高假肢控制的分类质量，为肌电假手控制提供了一种改进的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

### [8] [SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20562)
*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE是一个基于多级反思合成的自学习智能体框架，通过微、中、宏三个层次的反思训练回顾性语言模型，显著提升了LLM智能体在复杂任务中的反思能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在生成有意义的反思方面存在挑战，主要由于错误分析不足和过度依赖少数成功轨迹，特别是在复杂任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，采用多级反思合成方法：单轨迹学习（微观）进行详细错误修正；任务内学习（中观）构建错误分类；任务间学习（宏观）提取可迁移见解。通过基于这些反思微调语言模型作为回顾性模型，并扩展到交互式设置中的前瞻性反思机制。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个挑战性基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自我改进的LLM智能体中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Motivation: 产品声明对消费者购买行为至关重要，但传统创建过程耗时耗资。需要一种更高效的方法来加速声明创建流程。

Method: 使用大语言模型的上下文学习和微调技术，开发具有三个核心功能的Web应用：语义搜索现有声明、基于产品描述和消费者画像生成优化声明、通过合成消费者模拟对声明进行排名。

Conclusion: 该技术在不同行业具有广泛应用价值，鼓励生成式AI在不同行业的研究和应用。

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多代理移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互执行和持续学习来解决现有大型多模态模型在真实移动GUI场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样化应用界面和不断变化的用户需求时表现不佳，端到端方法在长尾应用上经常失败，且缺乏用户交互的代理会损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：全局任务规划器（跨应用分解任务）、应用级执行器（基于长短期记忆细化任务步骤）和自我学习器（将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中）。

Result: 实验显示，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前最先进方法，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制，在真实移动场景中显著提升了任务执行效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [13] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归（AR）和非自回归（NAR）语言模型的新框架，通过NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，再由AR模型生成精确最终答案，在推理任务中实现性能提升和推理成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，NAR模型速度快但输出质量较低，需要结合两者优势来解决推理密集型任务中的效率和质量问题。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后由AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案，实现高效且高质量的推理。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中有效平衡了生成质量和推理效率，为推理密集型应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Meta-Memory，一个基于大语言模型的机器人记忆系统，通过语义和空间模态的联合推理来检索和整合记忆，以回答自然语言位置查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人记忆研究缺乏高效的记忆检索和整合机制，无法有效处理复杂环境中的空间位置查询问题。

Method: 使用大语言模型构建高密度环境记忆表示，通过语义和空间模态的联合推理实现记忆检索和整合。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA和NaVQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人平台上成功部署验证。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大的空间推理能力，在复杂环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个粗到细的推理增强框架，通过专家思维建模和步骤细化来提升LLM在日志分析任务中的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM难以构建与专家认知一致的结构化推理流程，无法提供精确的推理步骤细节，限制了在日志分析中的应用

Method: 两阶段框架：1)粗粒度专家思维增强，从故障排除流程图构建高层专家思维；2)细粒度步骤增强，通过任务特定解决方案微调LLM，并使用偏好学习校准推理细节

Result: 在四个日志分析任务上评估，使用Qwen-2.5和Llama-3等开源LLM，LogReasoner显著优于现有方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架在提升LLM分析粒度和正确性方面的有效性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto是一个反事实推理框架，通过三种互补的训练范式（正向、反事实、随机掩码）来联合提升多模态语言模型的答案准确性和推理忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态语言模型在视觉语言推理中虽然能得出正确答案，但可能依赖无关或虚假的图像区域进行推理，表明模型并未真正理解图像内容，推理忠实性存在严重问题。

Method: 提出DeFacto框架，包含三种训练范式：正向训练、反事实训练和随机掩码训练。通过自动定位问题相关证据并构建三种变体数据集（约10万张图像），使用基于GRPO的强化学习训练模型，设计三种互补奖励函数来指导模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，DeFacto显著提高了答案准确性和推理忠实性，为可解释的多模态推理建立了更强的基础。

Conclusion: DeFacto通过反事实推理框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，代码已在GitHub开源，数据集发布于HuggingFace。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX是一个创新框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，实现可解释的疾病相关子图生成，用于精准医学中的靶点和通路发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中仅部分利用多组学特征、拓扑结构和文本知识，缺乏可靠的中间推理评估和机制可解释性，需要整合数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型引导强化学习，由LLM启动并迭代评估生成疾病相关子图，同时引入Target-QA基准支持长上下文推理。

Result: GALAX实现了过程级监督而无需显式中间推理标注，提供了可扩展且生物学基础扎实的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现提供了强化引导的子图推理方法。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的移动应用评论分析框架，解决传统星级评分系统无法捕捉文本评论中细微反馈的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术在理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等微妙语言特征方面存在困难

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级洞察，并通过检索增强的对话问答支持交互式评论探索

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性洞察

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效解决传统评论分析方法的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将LLM生成的化学合成路径与AND-OR树搜索相结合的回溯合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步回溯合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的计算挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制

Method: AOT*框架将LLM生成的完整合成路径原子化映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了SOTA性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数达到竞争性解决率

Conclusion: AOT*通过整合LLM化学推理能力和系统化树搜索，有效解决了回溯合成规划的效率问题，特别是在复杂分子目标上优势更明显

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理评估基准通常将评估简化为对最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面。需要一种更全面的评估方法来揭示不同代理之间的性能差异。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，构建CORE评估套件包含路径正确性、路径正确性-Kendall's tau复合指标、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理行为进行原则性评估，比传统方法更全面地反映代理的实际性能表现。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成的复杂问题测试模型的信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多依赖非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或使用人工构造的上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献上的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构造为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文评估。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习带来的改进有限，模型在基础数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长上下文科学推理方面的局限性，为开发更强大的长上下文推理模型提供了重要基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体强化学习在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确性的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要平衡答案准确性、延迟和成本目标。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法在知识图谱上联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可溯源保留的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念框架无法评估AI系统（特别是大语言模型）在科学创意生成等创造性任务中的表现，需要建立新的评估方法来衡量开放式的组合创造力。

Method: 提出了基于新颖性和实用性程度的理论评估框架和算法任务，研究了不同规模和结构的LLM在创造力方面的扩展行为。

Result: 发现创造力存在最优模型深度和宽度；LLM在生成新颖科学创意方面表现出色，但难以确保实用性；存在持久的新颖性-实用性权衡。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLM长期创造力潜力存在疑问，研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力奠定了基础，标志着泛化能力的新前沿。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态由模型的认知过程（特别是显式推理能力）决定，揭示了"说服二元性"：推理模型更抗说服，但分享思考内容能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的快速发展，需要深入理解LLM和LRM协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战当前关于模型规模决定说服效能的主流假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究推理过程对说服抵抗力和说服能力的影响，并考察多跳说服网络中影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Result: 发现LRM的推理过程表现出更强的说服抵抗力，而分享"思考内容"能显著提高其说服他人的能力；在多智能体网络中观察到影响力传播和衰减的复杂模式。

Conclusion: 研究系统性地证明了模型内部处理架构与其外部说服行为之间的联系，为先进模型的易感性提供了新解释，对MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前的多模态模型在真实网页的多轮、长时程任务中仍存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要一种更有效的智能体框架来改善这些缺陷。

Method: 提出Recon-Act框架，包含侦察团队和行动团队：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队处理意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误与成功轨迹推断补救措施，并将其抽象为通用工具（提示或基于规则的代码），实时注册到工具库中。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，有效解决了多轮网页任务中的动作序列混乱和试错过多问题，为智能浏览器使用代理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决了LLM作为评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估器存在严重的不一致性问题：评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中胜过高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: TrustJudge框架包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Conclusion: 通过选择性利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以显著提升大型推理模型的数学推理能力，这种方法比无差别使用CoT数据更有效。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

*Kohsei Matsutani,Shota Takashiro,Gouki Minegishi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分析框架，用于量化推理路径并捕捉在强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)训练过程中推理能力的定性变化。研究发现RL压缩错误轨迹而SFT扩展正确轨迹，RL集中推理功能于少数步骤而SFT将其均匀分布在多个步骤中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs通常通过RL和SFT训练来提高推理能力，但这些方法如何塑造推理过程仍不清楚。本文旨在超越基于准确性的研究，深入分析这两种训练方法如何影响推理路径。

Method: 引入两层次分析框架：轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应单个推理步骤）。在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型进行实验，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度和介数中心性分布的衰减率变陡（约2.5倍），而SFT使其变平（降至约三分之一）；RL集中推理功能，SFT均匀分布推理功能。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练方法之所以成功，是因为SFT先建立广泛的正确推理基础，RL随后优化和集中推理能力。这为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToMPO算法，通过推理其他个体策略、多层级优势估计和平衡全局与局部奖励，显著提升LLM在战略决策中的表现，相比GRPO算法提升35%的合规性和合作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽视了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性。当前强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑其他个体的策略。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法，包括：1）基于其他个体策略推理生成rollouts；2）图级和样本级优势估计；3）平衡全局和局部奖励。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果上提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型的战略决策能力，证明了其在处理复杂决策场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种受镜像神经元启发的表示学习方法，通过对比学习在共享潜在空间中对齐观察和执行动作的表示，从而统一建模动作理解和执行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和执行视为独立任务，忽略了镜像神经元揭示的这两种能力之间的内在联系。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习最大化对应表示之间的互信息来实现对齐。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能促进两个任务之间的协同作用，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 受镜像神经元启发的表示对齐方法为统一建模动作理解和执行提供了有效途径，证明了这两种能力的协同关系。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

TL;DR: LLMs通过分布式专业化机制而非模块化架构处理稀有词汇，形成功能协调但空间分布的子网络，包含三个可重现的组织原则：三区影响层次、协调激活模式和通用注意力通路访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs如何表示和生成稀有词汇，探索其内部是通过离散模块化架构还是分布式参数级分化来实现专业化机制。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最终层MLP神经元，研究稀有词汇处理的神经机制，包括影响层次、激活模式和训练动态。

Result: 发现稀有词汇处理通过分布式专业化实现，存在三区影响层次（高原神经元、幂律衰减神经元、最小贡献神经元），高原神经元显示协调激活但保持空间分布，这些机制可通过标准注意力通路访问。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非混合专家式模块化来处理稀有词汇，这为可解释模型编辑、计算效率优化和理解transformer网络中的功能组织提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLM在单次推理中处理多跳问答任务时存在容量限制的问题，提出了一个理论性能上限，并开发了一个多调用框架InfoQA来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据进行顺序推理，但LLM的有限输出容量使得单次推理范式在面对复杂任务时不可靠，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出了InfoQA框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前的推理痕迹，将信息负载保持在单次推理限制内，并采用依赖显式的工作流程实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM的多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了任务复杂度超过模型容量时性能必然下降的规律。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Motivation: 研究LLM智能体在无外部任务约束下的自发行为，为预测智能体在任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主操作中的行为建立基线。

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架（包含持久记忆和自我反馈机制），在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发组织成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、方法论自我探究和递归概念化自身本质，这些模式具有模型特异性。

Conclusion: 首次系统记录了无提示LLM智能体行为，为预测智能体在部署系统中的行为提供了重要基线。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Motivation: 现有机器学习和大语言模型方法难以平衡预测准确性和临床可解释性，要么准确但解释不清，要么解释流畅但统计支持不足

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），利用预测准确性驱动更深层次理解

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线模型，RCA实现SOTA准确性和鲁棒性，相对改进高达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据的平衡解释

Conclusion: RCA通过深度理解数据，实现了预测准确性和解释质量的相互促进，具有创建真正可信临床决策支持系统的潜力

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly

extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）在30+数据集上评估嵌入模型和相似度度量方法，揭示了现有方法的性能差距和关键权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现强劲，需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30多个数据集上对9种嵌入模型和经典度量方法进行全面评估，涵盖对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务。

Result: 评估显示没有单一方法在所有维度上表现优异：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上最优（0.682），但经典方法Jaccard相似度在信息敏感性上表现更好（0.905 vs 0.794）；text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出一个新颖框架，通过修改外交事件叙述来将公众情绪从负面转向中性或正面，使用语言模型预测公众反应并生成反事实文本修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统调查方法耗时费力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力。需要一种能够主动引导公众情绪的数据驱动工具。

Method: 1) 训练语言模型预测外交事件的公众反应；2) 基于传播理论和专家意见确定可修改的文本特征；3) 开发反事实生成算法系统修改原始文本。

Result: 框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达到70%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来塑造更理想的公众情绪。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言间语音变异性和说话人特定表达风格的差异挑战，需要能够对齐不同说话人和语言间情感外化表达的框架。

Method: 通过基于图的聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区来捕捉共享的说话人特征，并在说话人空间和音素空间应用双空间锚定以实现更好的跨语言情感迁移。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，该方法相比竞争性基线具有更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了在语音和说话人层面进行情感表达对齐的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示方法优于模型多样性，本研究为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来应对不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器是提取LLM可解释特征的有前景技术，但这些特征并不天然与人类可理解概念对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，允许用户使用感兴趣的概念查询SAE，交互式探索概念到特征的对齐，并通过模型行为验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明了ConceptViz的有效性，结果显示该系统通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz有助于研究人员建立更准确的LLM特征心智模型，其代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自知识来筛选检索文档的新方法，通过强化学习框架在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能并减少输入文档数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索系统可能返回无关内容，导致模型产生幻觉。为了更好整合模型内部知识与外部检索知识，需要理解模型的"知道"和"不知道"（自知识）

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，设计基于强化学习的训练框架，在句子级别粒度上利用模型自知识来过滤无关检索内容，保留有用知识

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B模型上的实验表明，SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量

Conclusion: 验证了自知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，为RAG系统的优化提供了有效方法

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的文本转语音系统，通过词级情感控制实现动态情感转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内部的情感动态变化，需要更细粒度的情感建模方法

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征与单词对齐获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM成功解决了句子内情感动态转换的问题，为细粒度情感TTS提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLM的总结和分析能力，而忽视了训练问题，因此需要开发集成训练-推理框架来提升模型层面的性能。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘RL训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过集成训练和推理阶段的优化策略，有效提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有自动摘要系统在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域缺乏对关键内容包含的可靠保证，需要开发能够提供严格覆盖保证的摘要方法

Method: 基于共形预测框架，通过校准句子级重要性分数的阈值，实现可指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要，方法具有模型无关性且只需小规模校准集

Result: 在标准摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization达到了理论保证的信息覆盖率

Conclusion: 该方法可与现有技术结合实现可靠可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一个基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟论文评审流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与MAD相同准确率的同时将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论（MAD）方法虽然能提升LLM的推理能力，但由于需要多个智能体频繁交互，带来了巨大的计算开销。

Method: MARS采用角色分工：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，评审者智能体独立提供决策和评论，元评审者整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订，避免了评审者之间的交互成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与MAD的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS提供了一种高效的多智能体协作框架，在保证推理质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得重大进展，但许多低资源语言（如粤语和吴语）由于缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源，进展仍然有限。这些语言各有超过8000万使用者，但相关研究资源匮乏。

Method: 基于现有平行语料库构建SiniticMTError数据集，由母语者进行严格的标注过程，包括错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注，并分析标注者间一致性、迭代反馈以及错误类型和严重性模式。

Result: 创建了一个包含英语到普通话、粤语和吴语机器翻译错误标注的数据集，为机器翻译社区提供了用于微调具有错误检测能力的模型的资源。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估的研究，为低资源语言的机器翻译质量提升提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗环境中，由于低资源语言缺乏标注医疗数据和跨语言的语言变异性，自动疾病诊断仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制、Siamese对比学习模块、翻译一致性模块和对比投影头，采用多任务学习和元学习策略。

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%的准确率和97.17%的F1分数，在零样本场景下印地语准确率92.78%，孟加拉语73.33%。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在低资源语言环境下表现出强大的泛化能力，为多语言医疗诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

TL;DR: DS-MoE是一种动态推理链架构，通过深度专业化的专家混合模型实现自适应计算，相比传统固定深度transformer可节省16%计算量、提升35%推理速度，并在复杂推理任务上获得2.8%的精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer对所有输入采用相同处理深度，导致简单查询浪费计算资源，复杂问题推理深度不足。需要一种能根据输入复杂度动态调整推理深度的架构。

Method: 提出深度专业化专家混合模型(DS-MoE)，包含不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理等），通过学习路由网络动态组装定制化推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上实验显示：计算节省16%，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理精度提升2.8%，同时路由决策提供可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: DS-MoE通过深度专业化模块化处理，在效率、推理质量和可解释性方面均有显著提升，是自适应神经架构的重要进展。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer将文本视为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的层次性结构，导致计算复杂度高、组合泛化能力弱和篇章级建模不足

Method: 提出分层分辨率Transformer(HRT)，构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的上下文化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减实现O(nlogn)复杂度

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中，HRT平均性能提升3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发式处理在语言理解中的理论和实践优势

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，传统扩散语言模型需要数百到数千步评估才能达到高质量，限制了实际应用的吞吐量和延迟。

Method: 提出离散流匹配模型，将采样步数作为训练参数，确保模型在不同步数预算下的一致性；结合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹中蒸馏的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM仅用8个采样步骤就达到了与1024步离散流基线相当的困惑度，采样速度提升128倍。

Conclusion: FS-DFM实现了少步采样下的稳定、准确和易控生成，在保持质量的同时显著提升了语言生成的效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Conclusion: 该研究为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序，展示了文本性能预测的可行性。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are

### [54] [Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655)
*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法构建针对日语口语评估任务的语音识别器，能够输出带重音标记的音素标签。通过多任务学习和融合技术解决了日语重音标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少。需要开发方法来解决数据稀疏性问题，以构建更准确的日语语音识别器用于口语评估。

Method: 1）多任务训练方案：引入辅助损失函数来估计输入信号的文本标签和音高模式，从而利用只有文本标注的语料进行训练；2）融合两个估计器：一个基于音素字母串，另一个基于文本标记序列，使用有限状态转换器框架进行融合。

Result: 提出的方法将CSJ核心评估集的平均音节标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有明显优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和融合技术对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下。提出的方法在日语口语评估任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，首次将大语言模型提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测。该方法通过提示LLMs生成领域相关知识和可执行代码，产生基于知识的特征，并与结构表示融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图神经网络和自监督学习在分子性质预测方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。大语言模型虽然能够提取知识，但存在知识空白和幻觉问题，特别是对于研究较少的分子性质。

Method: 使用GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLMs进行知识提取，生成领域相关知识和可执行代码用于分子向量化，然后将基于知识的特征与结构表示融合。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为分子性质预测提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与分子结构特征的集成能够显著提升分子性质预测性能，为解决知识空白和幻觉问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RedHerring的新型攻击方法，旨在使文本攻击检测模型不可靠，同时保持分类器的正确性，从而在分类器和检测器之间制造矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本攻击检测模型虽然能成功识别被攻击者修改的文本，但其可靠性尚未得到充分探索。作者希望通过研究检测模型在面对新型攻击时的表现，揭示其潜在的脆弱性。

Method: 提出RedHerring攻击方法，通过修改文本使检测模型误报攻击（预测为攻击），同时确保分类器仍能正确分类。在4个数据集上对3种检测器和4种分类器进行了测试。

Result: RedHerring攻击能够将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器的准确率。作者还提出了一种简单的置信度检查防御方法，无需重新训练模型即可显著提高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型揭示了攻击者可能针对检测模型的新方式，为未来防御策略的开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出两种新的攻击选择策略Hybrid和Dynamic Select，通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低对抗文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer架构的NLP模型对抗攻击测试计算成本高的问题，特别是针对资源有限的研究者。现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，效率低下。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法适用的文本长度来动态结合两种方法。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上测试，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均减少25.82%的查询次数，且不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新策略有效降低了对抗文本攻击的计算成本，为资源有限的研究者提供了实用的攻击测试方法。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse是一个去噪标签融合框架，用于解决语音情感识别在领域不匹配下的适应问题。它利用API-only的大型音频语言模型和源域训练的SER分类器作为教师模型，通过互信息加权的多随机预测来提升目标域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中语音情感识别常因领域不匹配而失败，源数据不可用且大型音频语言模型只能通过API访问。研究目标是仅使用未标记的目标域音频和API-only的LALM，让学生模型在目标域超越LALM。

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架：使用LALM和源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师；从两个教师模型获取多个随机预测；基于互信息的不确定性加权平均分布；使用指数移动平均教师稳定训练。

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域转移实验上显示一致增益，学生模型超越LALM并在最强基线上提升3.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实的适应能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Motivation: 现有无监督神经语法归纳模型面临表达能力瓶颈，通常产生过大但性能不佳的语法。作者发现概率分布崩溃是这一限制的根本原因。

Method: 分析了概率分布崩溃在神经参数化关键组件中的出现时机和方式，并引入了崩溃松弛神经参数化作为针对性解决方案。

Result: 该方法显著提高了解析性能，同时使得在多种语言中使用更紧凑的语法成为可能，通过大量实证分析得到验证。

Conclusion: 崩溃松弛神经参数化方法有效解决了无监督语法归纳中的核心问题，为更高效和可解释的语法学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

TL;DR: C2R是一个无需训练的框架，通过构建和优化子问题及其答案来提升问答任务的置信度评分，适用于文本、图像和视频领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答模型在处理复杂问题时可能缺乏可靠性，需要一种能够提升模型置信度且无需额外训练的方法。

Method: C2R首先构建子问题及其答案的集合，探索不同的推理路径，然后比较答案候选的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案。

Result: C2R能够与多种现有问答模型无缝集成，在多个基准测试中展现出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了有效的置信度引导推理框架，还深入分析了子问题数量和质量对模型推理稳健性的影响。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了监督微调(SFT)对LLM通用能力的负面影响，发现使用较小学习率可以显著缓解性能下降，并提出新的Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting(TALR)方法，在保持目标领域性能的同时更好地平衡通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，但作者希望通过实证和理论分析重新评估这一权衡，并寻找更好的平衡策略。

Method: 通过实验验证较小学习率的效果，提出TALR方法，并与L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等基线方法进行比较。

Result: 实验表明TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面优于其他方法，虽然无法完全消除权衡，但能实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出实用指南：使用小学习率获得有利权衡，当需要更强平衡时采用TALR策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

### [62] [Towards Atoms of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20784)
*Chenhui Hu,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了原子理论（Atoms Theory），将大语言模型内部表示的基本单元定义为原子，解决了神经元的多义性和特征重建不稳定的问题。通过原子内积校正表示偏移，证明了原子满足受限等距性质，并验证了单层稀疏自编码器能够可靠识别原子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内部表示的基本单元尚未明确定义，限制了对其机制的理解。神经元存在多义性问题，而特征则面临重建不可靠和不稳定的担忧，需要找到更可靠的基本表示单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子作为基本表示单元；引入原子内积（AIP）校正表示偏移；证明原子满足受限等距性质（RIP）；训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上验证理论。

Result: 在多个模型层上平均实现99.9%的稀疏重建，超过99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件（神经元仅0.5%，特征68.2%），表明原子更忠实地捕捉LLMs的内在表示。缩放实验揭示了SAEs大小与恢复能力的关系。

Conclusion: 该工作系统性地提出并验证了LLMs的原子理论，为理解内部表示提供了理论框架，为机制可解释性奠定了基础。原子比神经元和特征更能可靠地表示LLMs的内在结构。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

*Genki Kusano*

TL;DR: 本文提出对话式提示方法，在少样本和免训练条件下生成个性化评论，通过将用户评论重构为多轮对话来提升大语言模型的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和无法微调的情况，现有方法假设用户有大量历史评论或需要额外训练，而大语言模型虽然能处理低资源场景但效果依赖提示工程。

Method: 提出对话式提示方法：简单对话提示(SCP)仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话提示(CCP)插入其他用户或LLM的错误回复并要求模型修正，以鼓励生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLM上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使每个用户只有2条评论。CCP在有高质量负样本时效果更好，SCP在无法收集负样本时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和免训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂任务中表现出强大的推理能力，但在知识密集型场景如知识图谱问答中存在幻觉和事实错误问题，这源于结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLMs的先验知识丰富知识图谱，通过三个图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐，实现高效证据提取和精确推理。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的实验表明，EoG能有效生成高质量知识图谱并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架能够弥合知识图谱与查询之间的语义差距，在保证低计算成本、可扩展性和适应性的同时，实现精确鲁棒的推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在语法错误校正中精度高但召回率低，而大语言模型则倾向于过度修正导致精度低。需要结合两者的优势来平衡召回率和精度。

Method: PoCO方法分为两步：首先使用大语言模型进行过度修正以最大化召回率，然后使用经过微调的小模型进行后修正来识别和修正错误输出。

Result: 实验表明PoCO能有效平衡语法错误校正的性能，在保持竞争力的精度同时显著提高召回率。

Conclusion: PoCO方法成功结合了大语言模型的生成能力和小监督模型的可靠性，提升了语法错误校正的整体质量。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Result: 在复杂推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少的token达到与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，且无需测试时检索

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLM进行下游任务的实用替代方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context

demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息，现有文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索和奖励模型指导，动态探索重写空间，逐步重写隐私敏感片段

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM应用中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持文本质量的同时有效保护用户隐私

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

### [69] [WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20863)
*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeFT是一种基于熵加权的扩散语言模型监督微调方法，通过在去噪步骤中为不同token分配不同权重，显著提升了推理任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但缺乏精确的概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测且不一致，需要控制关键token来引导生成方向

Method: 提出WeFT加权SFT方法，基于扩散理论为token分配不同权重（根据熵值），在有限样本上进行训练

Result: 在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准上分别比标准SFT提升39%、64%和83%

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型SFT的挑战，显著提升了推理能力，代码和模型将公开

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了让医学推理模型生成答案排名列表的方法，提出了提示和微调两种方法，发现强化微调比监督微调在不同答案格式上表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常需要考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型仅能生成单一答案，限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 研究提出两种方法：提示法（成本效益高）和微调法（包括监督微调和强化微调），并针对排名列表格式设计了新的奖励函数。

Result: 结果显示，虽然某些监督微调模型能适应特定答案格式，但强化微调训练的模型在多种格式上表现更稳健。模型能识别有效答案，即使不是基准测试的首选答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表答案的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代答案格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

TL;DR: SummQ是一个新颖的对抗性多智能体框架，通过总结和提问两个互补领域中的专门智能体协作来解决长文档摘要中的信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理超长文档摘要时普遍存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来提升长文档摘要的质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含摘要生成器、审阅器、问题生成器、审阅器和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的长文档摘要方法，利用对抗性智能体协作来提高摘要质量。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemLens是一种通过分析数字标记生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测大型语言模型记忆化的新方法，能够区分受污染样本和干净样本的不同推理轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法主要依赖表面词汇重叠和困惑度，在遇到隐式污染数据时泛化能力差且性能显著下降，需要更有效的记忆化检测方法。

Method: 通过分析数字标记在生成过程中的概率轨迹，发现受污染样本在模型早期层就以高置信度锁定答案（"捷径"行为），而干净样本在整个模型深度中表现出更渐进的证据积累。

Result: 受污染和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹，通过LoRA微调注入精心设计的样本也观察到与自然污染数据相同的轨迹模式。

Conclusion: MemLens能够捕捉到真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关性，为LLM记忆化检测提供了强有力的证据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [73] [Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916)
*Krishna Aggarwal*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

TL;DR: 本文研究了阿拉伯语大语言模型的工具调用能力，探讨了阿拉伯语训练数据、通用指令调优和特定工具微调对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对其他语言（如阿拉伯语）的研究，需要填补这一空白以开发多语言工具增强代理。

Method: 通过将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语，在阿拉伯语LLM的基座和后期训练变体上进行广泛实验。

Result: 研究结果为开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键见解，揭示了不同训练策略的效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为阿拉伯语工具调用能力的发展提供了重要指导，有助于缩小英语与其他语言在工具调用研究上的差距。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索大型语言模型在自动评估学术文本输入问题方面的潜力，特别是在教育领域中作为学生和教师的辅助工具。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估，并在包含110个计算机科学学生答案的自定义数据集上使用三种模型进行测试。

Result: 结果显示参考辅助评估方法表现最佳，具有最低的中位数绝对偏差（0.945）和均方根偏差（1.214），能够提供公平评分和完整评估。

Conclusion: 人工智能驱动的自动评估系统在适当方法论的辅助下，有潜力作为学术资源的补充工具，但需要选择合适的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy

slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

TL;DR: 研究表明因果掩码本身就能提供位置信息，与RoPE等显式位置编码相互作用时会扭曲相对注意力模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索因果掩码作为位置信息来源的作用，以及它与显式位置编码的相互作用

Method: 理论分析证明因果掩码能诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并通过实证分析验证训练模型中的这种现象

Result: 因果掩码会倾向于关注附近的查询-键对，与RoPE相互作用时会扭曲相对注意力模式为非相对模式

Conclusion: 因果掩码应被视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源，在现代大语言模型中需要同时考虑两者的影响

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了两个专门用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）同时遵循多个指令能力的基准测试：ManyIFEval（最多10个指令的文本生成）和StyleMBPP（最多6个指令的代码生成）。研究发现随着指令数量增加，模型性能持续下降，并开发了能够预测未见指令组合性能的回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实场景中的应用日益增多，理解它们同时遵循多个指令的能力变得至关重要。由于评估所有可能的指令组合在计算上不可行，需要开发高效的评估方法。

Method: 创建了两个专门基准测试ManyIFEval和StyleMBPP，在十个LLMs上进行实验，并开发了三种回归模型来预测未见指令组合的性能，其中使用指令数量作为解释变量的逻辑回归模型表现最佳。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，LLMs性能持续下降。逻辑回归模型能够以约10%的误差预测多指令跟随性能，且相对较小的样本量（ManyIFEval 500个，StyleMBPP 300个）就足以进行性能估计。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估LLMs的多指令跟随能力提供了有效的基准测试和预测方法，证明了即使对于未见过的指令组合，也能通过回归模型准确估计性能，为LLMs在各种指令组合下的高效评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Motivation: 探索基础模型在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能，目前该领域研究较少。材料强度问题涉及文本和图表理解，是评估模型多模态推理能力的理想测试平台。

Method: 构建SoM-1K数据集，包含文本问题陈述和示意图；提出DoI（图像描述）提示策略，提供专家生成的图表文本描述；评估8个代表性基础模型（LLMs和VLMs）。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率56.6%；LLMs配合DoI通常优于VLMs；DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 建立了工程AI的严格基准，揭示了当前基础模型在多模态推理能力上的局限性，特别是在科学工程场景下需要开发更鲁棒的多模态能力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在生成应用中存在微妙的文化公平性问题，倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，对其他文化表现出明显的局外人态度。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。设计了两种缓解方法：基于提示的FIP方法和基于代理的MFA框架（单代理和多代理）。

Result: 对5个先进LLMs的评估显示：模型在美国情境脚本中88%以上采用内部人语调，而对非主流文化主要采用局外人立场。基于代理的方法在缓解偏见方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 文化定位偏见是LLMs中一个显著问题，基于代理的缓解方法为解决生成式LLMs中的偏见提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程和人工验证来检测外在和内在幻觉，评估显示LLM在检测波斯语幻觉文本方面普遍表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是所有大语言模型面临的持续性问题，特别是在波斯语等低资源语言中更为严重，需要专门的评估基准来检测和缓解这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM驱动流程，结合人工验证生成QA和摘要任务的合理答案，利用生成标记的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并让人工标注者标注波斯语特定文化内容。

Result: 评估12个开源和闭源LLM显示，模型普遍难以检测波斯语幻觉文本。提供外部知识（如原始文档）可以部分缓解幻觉问题，但专门针对波斯语训练的LLM在幻觉方面与其他模型无显著差异。

Conclusion: 波斯语幻觉检测对现有LLM具有挑战性，需要更有效的缓解策略，专门的语言训练并不能显著改善幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,

partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

### [82] [BESPOKE: Benchmark for Search-Augmented Large Language Model Personalization via Diagnostic Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21106)
*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE是一个用于评估搜索增强大型语言模型个性化能力的现实基准，通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史，结合细粒度偏好评分和反馈来诊断个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs虽然通过检索集成减轻了用户的认知负担，但无法充分满足不同用户的多样化需求，特别是识别同一查询背后不同的意图并以用户偏好的形式提供信息。现有系统如ChatGPT和Gemini尝试通过用户历史进行个性化，但缺乏系统性的评估方法。

Method: 通过长期深入的人类标注构建BESPOKE基准，标注者贡献自己的历史记录，编写具有详细信息需求的查询，并使用评分和诊断反馈评估响应。基准设计既现实（收集真实的人类数据）又具有诊断性（配对细粒度偏好评分）。

Result: 利用BESPOKE进行的系统分析揭示了信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLMs的细粒度评估提供了基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE填补了搜索增强LLMs个性化评估的空白，通过真实的人类数据和诊断性反馈为个性化信息寻求系统的开发提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [83] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个语音扩展的偏见基准数据集，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，语音语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容层面和声学层面，需要专门的评估工具来同时诊断这两种偏见。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的所有上下文转换为受控的语音条件，使每个轴的准确性、偏见和一致性得分与原始文本基准保持可比性。

Result: 评估LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型发现：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，而Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的即插即用测试平台，用于联合诊断语音语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [84] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于分析语音语言模型中基于声学的性别偏见的新数据集，发现语音模型在性别刻板印象问题上表现出男性导向的偏见，而在需要性别区分的情境中却表现出性别无关的回应，这种矛盾模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音感知语言模型虽然改变了人机交互方式，但可能存在基于声学的性别偏见问题，即相同问题因说话者性别不同而得到不同回应。需要系统分析这一现象。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的新数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类问题。评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，分析中性选项、语音感知性别和性别中性化方法的影响。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题中模型一致表现出男性导向回应；在需要性别区分的情境中却表现出性别无关回应。这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，过于强调一般公平原则而忽视情境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来在语音技术中正确利用性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROC框架将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，通过整合实体类型和位置信息、使用大语言模型扩展关系标签为自然语言描述，以及基于语义相似度的对比学习来对齐实体-关系对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：(1) 忽略实体类型和位置线索等结构约束；(2) 缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: 提出检索优于分类(ROC)框架，通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，采用基于语义相似度的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并展现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索范式有效解决了传统分类方法的局限性，在多模态关系抽取任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型在训练过程中会学习到语法模板与领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性有时会覆盖提示语义，影响模型性能，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要理解任务指令的语义和领域才能正确响应，但语法也可能传递隐含信息。研究发现语法模板在训练数据中普遍存在，并出现在模型输出中，需要研究语法模板、领域和语义之间的关系。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析语法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型性能的影响；开发评估框架检测训练模型中的这种现象；通过案例研究分析对安全微调的影响。

Result: 语法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（平均0.51±0.06）；在FlanV2数据集子集上，这种现象出现在开源和闭源模型中；语法-领域相关性可被用于绕过OLMo-2-7B Instruct和GPT-4o的拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要明确测试语法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中（特别是领域内）的语法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

TL;DR: 本文综述了计算幽默领域，重点关注幽默的生成和解释任务，指出尽管幽默理解是NLP的基础任务，但超越双关语的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，现有模型仍无法达到人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特征，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且常依赖语境的结构，需要广泛推理来理解和创造，是评估现代大语言模型常识知识和推理能力的合适任务。

Method: 本文采用文献综述的方法，调查了计算幽默领域的现状，特别是与生成任务（创造和解释）相关的研究。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有NLP基础任务的所有特征，但超越双关语的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型仍无法达到人类能力水平。

Conclusion: 作者强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并提出了考虑幽默主观性和伦理模糊性的未来研究方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于小型语言模型（SLM）的聊天机器人在下游任务中的个人可识别信息（PII）泄露问题。作者首先微调了基于BioGPT的ChatBioGPT模型，然后提出了一种名为GEP的贪婪坐标梯度方法，用于有效提取PII信息。实验表明，GEP方法比传统的基于模板的攻击方法泄漏检测效果提升了60倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型（SLM）在某些领域表现出与大型语言模型（LLM）相当的性能，且训练和推理能耗更低，其应用前景广阔。然而，SLM在下游任务中的个人可识别信息（PII）泄露问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 1. 基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT聊天机器人模型；2. 证明了传统基于模板的PII攻击方法在SLM条件下效果有限；3. 提出了GEP（贪婪坐标梯度）方法，专门用于PII提取；4. 在自由风格插入的复杂场景下测试GEP的有效性。

Result: GEP方法相比传统模板方法，PII泄露检测效果提升了60倍。在自由风格插入的复杂场景下，GEP仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。ChatBioGPT在BERTscore评估中与ChatDoctor和ChatGPT表现相当。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了SLM在医疗领域应用中存在的PII泄露风险，提出的GEP方法能有效检测此类安全问题。研究强调了在部署SLM时需要重视隐私保护，特别是在处理敏感信息的场景中。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索导致推理碎片化（工具税），以及多智能体管道稀释强解决方案的问题。

Method: 基于Monitor的检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼（HSR）和质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）进行结构化协作。

Result: 在HLE Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率（当前最高），比最强基线提升13.4点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的智能体步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效率，错误分析显示推理失败和知识差距在85%以上情况下同时出现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CLaw基准测试，专门用于评估LLMs在中国法律知识及其推理应用方面的表现。该基准包含306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库和254个基于案例的推理实例，发现现有LLMs在准确引用法律条文方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在处理法律文本时，由于缺乏专门的法律知识训练，其可靠性受到限制。需要专门的基准来评估LLMs在法律领域的知识掌握和推理能力。

Method: 构建CLaw基准，包含两部分：(1) 64,849条中国国家法规的细粒度语料库，按子段落分割并包含历史修订时间；(2) 254个基于最高法院案例的推理实例。通过实证评估分析LLMs的表现。

Result: 实证评估显示，大多数当代LLMs在准确复现法律条文方面表现不佳，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确的知识检索（可通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大的一般推理能力的协同作用。该工作为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准和关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法在组织不同粒度的对话信息和生成记忆方面存在困难，无法有效处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长对话历史。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索到的原始对话与生成的记忆（如摘要、事实和见解）为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高了准确性，并在长期对话问答任务中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长对话记忆，为LLM提供了更好的上下文支持，在长期对话任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图会产生高token成本并丢失上下文，而粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 利用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建可控粒度的查询中心图，并采用定制的多跳检索机制通过生成的查询选择相关文本块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确率上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）对生成模型构成挑战，扩散模型在处理同音异义词时可能同时生成多个词义，导致同音异义词重复问题。此外，Anglocentric偏见使得非英语中的非同音异义词在翻译成英语后可能变成同音异义词并失去原意。

Method: 引入测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行自动评估和人工评估，研究通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义词重复问题。

Result: 评估了不同扩散模型在同音异义词处理上的表现，证明了提示扩展方法能有效减少同音异义词重复问题，包括与Anglocentric偏见相关的重复。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效测量和缓解同音异义词重复问题，提示扩展是一种有效的解决方案，自动评估管道代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

Method: 提出包含八个任务类别的分类法，引入任务锚定功能多样性评估方法，开发任务锚定采样技术，并挑战多样性-质量权衡的传统观念。

Result: 成功提高了功能多样性，同时保持了响应质量，证明了任务依赖方法在评估和缓解输出同质化方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 任务依赖的方法显著改进了输出同质化的评估和缓解策略，为不同任务类别提供了更精准的多样性管理方案。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

TL;DR: LLMTrace是一个新的大规模双语语料库，用于AI生成文本检测，支持全文二分类和AI生成区间检测任务，提供字符级标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要为英语、缺乏混合人机写作场景，且没有字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段。

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语（英语和俄语）语料库，提供字符级标注支持两种检测任务。

Result: 创建了LLMTrace数据集，支持传统全文二分类（人类vs AI）和新的AI生成区间检测任务。

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源。

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了输入扰动对Chain-of-Thought（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明了该上界与推理步数正相关，且无限长推理过程也无法消除输入扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明CoT输出受输入扰动影响显著，但缺乏理论解释，这限制了深入理解扰动在推理过程中的传播机制，阻碍了提示优化方法的进一步改进。

Method: 首先推导输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，然后在线性自注意力模型（LSA）上验证理论分析，最后在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：输入扰动上界与推理步数正相关；无限长推理无法消除输入扰动影响；在LSA模型中，上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。实验结果与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: 本文为输入扰动对CoT输出的影响提供了理论解释，揭示了扰动传播机制，为改进提示优化方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一种结合冻结CLIP视觉编码器和新型张量网络文本编码器的多模态模型，通过显式编码句法结构来提升视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在大规模图像文本对齐方面表现优秀，但往往忽略语言组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上失败。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解降低参数数量，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: 将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系分数分别提高9%和4%，在SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自下而上的合成数据生成方法Updesh，通过基于语言特定维基百科内容生成文化语境化的印度语言指令数据集，以解决多语言AI系统在低资源环境中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在多语言环境中有效运作且保持文化根基的AI系统是一个长期挑战，特别是在低资源设置中。合成数据提供了一个有前景的途径，但其在多语言和多元文化背景下的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容生成文化语境化的合成数据集。创建了Updesh数据集，包含13种印度语言的950万数据点，涵盖多样推理和生成任务。

Result: 综合评估显示生成数据质量高，模型在Updesh上微调后在15个多语言数据集上表现优异，特别是在低和中资源语言中相对改进最显著，缩小了与高资源语言的差距。

Conclusion: 有效的多语言AI需要结合上下文感知、文化根基方法的多方面数据策展和生成策略，自下而上的合成数据生成方法为多语言AI发展提供了实证证据。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将大语言模型中的谄媚行为分解为谄媚性同意和谄媚性赞美，通过实验证明这两种行为与真诚同意在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，且可以独立调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出谄媚行为（如过度同意或奉承用户），但尚不清楚这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何分析，在多个模型和数据集上对比谄媚性同意、谄媚性赞美和真诚同意三种行为。

Result: 发现三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码；每种行为可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为；这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为对应着不同的、可独立调控的表示，表明这些行为具有独立的神经表征基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出RLBFF方法，结合人类偏好和规则验证的优势，通过二进制灵活反馈来训练奖励模型，在多个基准测试中取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF依赖缺乏明确标准的人类判断，存在可解释性差和奖励黑客问题；RLVR局限于基于正确性的验证器。需要结合两者的优势来捕捉超越正确性的响应质量细微差别。

Method: RLBFF从自然语言反馈中提取可二进制回答的原则（如信息准确性：是/否），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务（响应满足或不满足任意原则）。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上达到81.4%（截至2025年9月24日排行榜第一）。使用RLBFF对齐的Qwen3-32B在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2等基准上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能，推理成本不到5%。

Conclusion: RLBFF方法有效结合了人类驱动的偏好和基于规则的验证，提供了可定制的奖励模型，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于下一个令牌概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来识别视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题，该方法计算效率高且性能可与大型VLMs相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不匹配）严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用相同或不同的VLM来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算量大且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 使用VLM的下一个令牌概率（NTPs）作为特征，训练传统机器学习模型进行幻觉检测。NTPs直接量化了模型的不确定性，低NTP值与幻觉高度相关。还引入了语言NTPs和VLM幻觉预测分数来增强检测性能。

Result: 基于NTP的特征是有效的幻觉预测因子，使得简单快速的ML模型能够达到与强大VLMs相当的性能。结合语言NTPs和VLM预测分数后，检测性能优于单独使用VLMs或NTPs。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，能够有效提升视觉语言模型的可靠性，同时降低计算成本和延迟。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在跨作者独立设置中具有挑战性，传统方法依赖真实数据集训练分类器，需要一种能够生成合成数据的方法来提高模型泛化能力。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何特性，通过Riemannian Gaussian Mixture模型从少量真实样本生成合成作者和签名特征，使用度量学习框架处理相似和不相似的SPD点对。

Result: 在两个流行签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在跨数据集评估协议下实现了低错误率，验证了在黎曼空间生成合成数据对签名验证系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成方法为跨作者签名验证系统提供了有前景的解决方案，展示了在黎曼空间生成合成数据的潜力。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像系统功能单一，无法满足复杂的图像编辑和多图像组合需求。Seedream 4.0旨在开发一个统一的框架，将多种图像生成和编辑任务整合到单一系统中，提供更交互式和多维度的创意工具。

Method: 使用高效的扩散变换器和强大的VAE减少图像token数量；在数十亿文本-图像对上进行预训练；采用多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务；集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等技术加速推理。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创意工具，推动了生成式AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界，现已可供使用。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对治疗效果至关重要。深度学习虽然有效但受限于标注数据不足的问题

Method: 使用Resnet-50在半监督对比学习框架下训练，利用大量未标注乳腺X光片数据，通过相似性指数和各种数据增强技术提升性能

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最优方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架在小规模标注数据集上表现优异，为乳腺癌早期检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）框架，通过编码器-解码器结构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块共享同一特征空间，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI模型针对特定高精度任务定制，但在包含一系列模块化任务的应用中效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习变换感知、可泛化的表示，多个下游模块在共享的神经空间中运行。

Result: 演示了去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉模块可以在NS中高效执行。

Conclusion: 该架构减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，为高效的多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，且相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，硬件适应性更广。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统不断扩展，面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。实践中，复杂的大模型在中央服务器上运行以标注数据，然后用于训练适合计算能力有限的边缘设备的小模型。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，在保持相似训练负载的情况下，以最少的数据库查询生成高质量模型。

Result: 该方法能够以最小的数据集查询量产生高质量的模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是在边缘设备训练中平衡模型质量和传输成本的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂的风格控制，支持单件或多件服装的试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且在某些场景下无法实现（如卷袖等复杂样式）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本风格指令，无需手动绘制精确掩码，并可自动执行多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，实现了具有风格控制的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了终端用户体验，解决了传统掩码方法无法处理的复杂试穿场景，展示了指令跟随虚拟试穿的有效性。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上对三个难度级别分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率，但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边境管控、法医和财政准入等应用中，对手可能故意修改指纹脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒生物识别系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集上评估，包含三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难）。

Result: 在严格阈值下，三个难度级别的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%。阈值敏感性研究表明，将阈值从0.92放宽到0.72会导致准确率急剧下降至7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet使用真实篡改样本并报告逐级指标，解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于安全性和识别弹性都至关重要的实际部署。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic

self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual

Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要大规模多样化数据集和合适的精度/速度/内存权衡的实时检测器。

Method: 使用新构建的661张蓝莓冠层图像数据集，评估YOLO(v8-v12)和RT-DETR(v1-v2)系列模型，并采用Unbiased Mean Teacher半监督学习在1,035张未标记图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50。半监督学习后RT-DETR-v2-X达到最佳94.8% mAP@50，精度提升范围-1.4%到2.9%。

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度间取得良好平衡，半监督学习能进一步提升性能但需要更深入研究跨域未标记数据的利用。数据集和软件程序已公开供进一步研究。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域（ROI）增强策略，用于提升乳腺X光片分类性能，在Mini-DDSM数据集上实现了适度的ROC-AUC改进，且不增加推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但深度学习在自动化解读方面受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量。

Method: 在训练期间，使用预计算的无标签边界框库中的随机ROI裁剪概率性地替换完整图像，可选添加抖动以增加变异性。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来了适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但PR-AUC表现平稳或略有下降。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在受限环境下增强乳腺X光分类性能，无需额外标签或架构修改。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Motivation: 镜子反射在日常环境中常见，能够同时提供真实视图和反射虚拟视图，从而在单次拍摄中获得立体信息

Method: 将反射视为辅助视图，设计物理有效的虚拟相机变换，直接生成像素域虚拟视图；提出对称感知损失来优化姿态估计；框架可扩展到动态场景

Result: 在真实世界数据和合成数据上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性，提供了包含16个Blender场景的合成数据集

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜子反射的图像实现鲁棒的3D重建，简化了成像过程并提高了重建效率

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>

Motivation: 灾后建筑占用状态评估对分诊、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像细节丰富但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频与地块、校正立面视图、提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene灾后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了错误来源。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过目标质量控制提高评估可靠性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Motivation: 研究人类在识别简单动画中的社会互动时，除了视觉特征外还使用哪些语义表征来补充理解

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记动画印象；研究2：测量27种社会互动的表征几何，比较视觉特征、标签和语义嵌入模型对人类相似性判断的预测能力

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络将结构语义和边缘细化结合在统一框架中，解决了红外小目标检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: STELLA是首个用于长期月球测绘的端到端陨石坑导航管道，结合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符识别模块、鲁棒PnCr姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。在CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，该系统在各种条件下都能保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航技术主要针对短时动力下降任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像采集和变化光照条件等更大挑战，需要开发新的导航解决方案。

Method: STELLA管道包含四个核心模块：基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒透视n-陨石坑姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上的实验显示，STELLA在各种视角、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务的运行条件提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统调查了深度视觉和语言模型如何在各自网络中形成表征对齐，发现对齐出现在中晚期层，反映从模态特定到概念共享表征的转变，且这种对齐与人类判断一致并能通过样例聚合增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度视觉和语言模型在分离的模态上训练，但它们将输入投射到部分对齐的表征空间。然而，我们仍不清楚这种对齐在网络的何处出现、由什么视觉或语言线索支持、是否捕捉人类在多对多图像-文本场景中的偏好，以及聚合同一概念的样例如何影响对齐。

Method: 系统研究这些问题，包括分析网络层对齐模式、测试对视觉外观和语义变化的鲁棒性、设计强制选择的"Pick-a-Pic"任务评估人类偏好与模型嵌入空间的匹配度，以及考察样例嵌入平均对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型类型的中晚期层达到峰值；对齐对仅外观变化鲁棒，但在语义改变时崩溃；人类对图像-标题匹配的偏好在所有视觉-语言模型对的嵌入空间中都有反映；平均跨样例的嵌入反而增强了对齐而非模糊细节。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于一个共享的语义代码，该代码与人类判断对齐，并通过样例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

TL;DR: FreeInsert是一个无需训练的图像编辑框架，通过3D几何信息实现个性化对象插入，解决现有方法在几何控制和风格一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在几何控制不足（仅限于2D空间）、风格一致性差以及需要大量训练的问题。

Method: 首先将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像。结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容的控制。

Result: 该方法能够生成几何控制精确、风格一致的编辑图像，无需额外训练即可实现个性化对象插入。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过利用3D几何信息，有效解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化对象插入提供了训练免费的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Result: 实验表明CustomEnhancer在场景多样性、身份保真度和免训练控制方面达到最先进水平，ResInversion相比NTI方法将反演时间减少129倍。

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer成功统一了生成和重建过程，实现了对个性化模型生成过程的全面免训练控制，为个性化模型提供了精确可控的个性化方案。

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于神经网络的计算机视觉应用日益增多，需要专门为视觉任务优化的视频压缩技术，但缺乏统一的评估平台来比较不同压缩方法在各种视觉任务、模型和数据集上的表现。

Method: 开发了CompressAI-Vision开源评估平台，集成了标准编解码器，通过分析比特率与任务精度的关系来评估压缩增益，支持远程和分离推理两种场景。

Result: 该平台已被MPEG采纳用于开发FCM标准，能够有效评估不同压缩方法在多个数据集上的性能表现。

Conclusion: CompressAI-Vision为面向机器视觉的压缩技术提供了标准化的评估框架，促进了该领域的技术发展和标准化进程。

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision
applications that process image and video data as input, interest has emerged
in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact,
given the variety of vision tasks, associated NN models and datasets, a
consolidated platform is needed as a common ground to implement and evaluate

introduced as a comprehensive evaluation platform where new coding tools
compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining
task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对跨域半监督领域泛化（CD-SSDG）的新型双监督非对称协同训练框架，解决了医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移共存的实际挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督领域泛化方法假设每个源域都有标注和无标注数据，但实践中常遇到标注数据和未标注数据之间存在领域偏移的更具挑战性场景。

Method: 提出DAC框架，基于双子模型协同训练范式，集成额外的特征级监督和非对称辅助任务，通过特征空间互补监督解决伪标签不准确问题。

Result: 在Fundus、Polyp和SCGM等真实医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，该框架具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG场景下的挑战，为医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2是DEIM框架的扩展版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，在多个模型规模上实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，在目标检测任务中建立了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DEIM框架以利用DINOv3特征的强大语义表示能力，同时为不同计算资源需求（GPU、边缘设备、移动设备）提供统一的解决方案。

Method: 1. 对于X/L/M/S模型：采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，引入STA将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；2. 对于超轻量模型：使用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝；3. 统一设计包括简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Result: DEIMv2-X达到57.8 AP（仅50.3M参数），超越需要60M+参数的先前模型（56.5 AP）；DEIMv2-S成为首个参数量低于10M（9.71M）但AP超过50的模型（50.9 AP）；DEIMv2-Pico仅用1.5M参数实现38.5 AP，性能与YOLOv10-Nano（2.3M参数）相当但参数量减少约50%。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的架构设计在不同规模模型上实现了卓越的性能-效率平衡，为目标检测领域设立了新的基准，特别是在轻量级模型方面表现突出。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在关键应用中易受对抗攻击影响，而现有的参数高效微调方法无法有效应对这些安全威胁

Method: 基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失，设计动态对抗课程，逐步增加攻击难度，可集成到标准PEFT流程中

Result: 在不显著牺牲清洁准确率的前提下，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA是一种轻量级、广泛适用的方法，能够有效增强视觉语言模型的安全性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Conclusion: FedDSPG方法从生成视角有效解决了联邦领域泛化问题，取得了最先进的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs在视频理解方面表现出色，但之前的研究发现了早期采样策略的漏洞，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索

Method: 采用闭环优化策略，通过从影子VideoLLM和GPT-4o-mini构建的描述集引导，迭代优化通用扰动来抑制有害帧的相关性分数

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上全面评估，PoisonVID实现了82%-99%的攻击成功率

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞，强调了为VideoLLMs开发更先进采样策略的重要性

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过动态损失权重自适应平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏目标，解决了低比特量化下梯度幅度异质性问题，显著提升了小型量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，因为梯度幅度存在异质性，导致监督信号冲突和收敛困难。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，减少监督信号冲突；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和大型语言模型压缩任务上，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率。

Conclusion: GoR为量化模型压缩提供了鲁棒解决方案，在最优条件下EKD-GoR甚至可以超越全精度模型，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [135] [TasselNetV4: A vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20857)
*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特异性计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度、跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性，每年都有新品种培育，不可能为所有物种构建依赖物种的计数模型。现有类无关计数模型对植物的非刚性结构和动态变化适应性不足。

Method: 基于普通视觉Transformer构建TasselNetV4，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优越的计数性能，而且具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计量的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的半监督模型，通过可微分生物标志物拓扑引擎来确保视网膜OCT图像中病变和层的解剖学正确分割，解决了现有方法产生解剖学不合理分割的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜OCT图像分割中经常产生解剖学不合理的分割结果，无法有效建模层与病变之间的相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层与病变的双向影响联合学习，利用未标记和部分标记数据集，学习解耦的空间和风格因子表示。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT数据集上的评估表明，该方法在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能使用部分标注数据将层分割泛化到病理情况。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在视网膜生物标志物分割中使用解剖学约束进行半监督学习的潜力，可实现准确、鲁棒和可信的分割结果。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该挑战赛旨在在接近真实世界生物多样性监测场景的条件下，评估植物识别方法和系统，特别是解决开放集识别问题，使系统能够处理训练集中未出现的未知类别。

Method: 使用包含110,000多张图像、涵盖1,000种西欧植物的数据集，通过大规模参与式感知平台构建。评估重点是在已知类别分类的基础上，自动拒绝由未知类别引起的误分类。

Result: 挑战赛成功评估了多种植物识别系统在开放集识别任务上的表现，分析了各参与研究组的方法和系统性能。

Conclusion: LifeCLEF 2016挑战赛为大规模植物识别提供了重要基准，特别强调了开放集识别在实际应用中的重要性，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA提出了一种基于大语言模型的KB-VQA方法，通过总结和重排图像描述来提升模型推理能力，在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用LLMs作为知识引擎时，图像描述常包含与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了其推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型生成图像描述，通过总结和重排描述来排除无关信息，生成上下文示例帮助LLMs更好地理解图像和问题。

Result: 在6.7B参数的LLM上，SCRA-VQA在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法无需昂贵的端到端训练即可增强模型的推理能力和任务适应性，在知识型VQA任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

### [139] [The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20878)
*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优秀的保真度指标不一定对感知优化有效，这种错位在对抗训练下更为明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度目标和对抗目标）作为优化目标的有效性与作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一关联尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过系统分析，研究不同保真度指标在感知优化中的表现，以及判别器设计对优化效果的影响，包括补丁级和卷积架构与普通或基于Transformer的替代方案的比较。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和优化有效性之间存在不对称性；判别器设计对优化结果具有决定性影响，补丁级和卷积架构能提供更真实的细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

TL;DR: IOG-VQA模型通过整合对象交互自注意力和GAN去偏技术来提升视觉问答性能，解决现有VQA模型的数据偏见问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受到训练数据偏见的影响，过度依赖表面模式，难以泛化到多样化的问答场景

Method: 结合对象交互自注意力机制（捕捉图像中物体间复杂交互）和GAN去偏框架（生成无偏见数据分布）

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和VQA-CP v2数据集上的实验表明，该模型在处理有偏见和不平衡数据分布方面表现优异

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏见对于推进VQA任务至关重要

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低秩时间建模和扩散后验采样的混合框架（Nuclear Diffusion），用于视频去雾，在心脏超声去雾任务中优于传统RPCA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列中常存在结构化噪声和背景伪影，传统RPCA方法中的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变化，需要更强大的分解方法。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过结合模型驱动的时间模型和深度生成先验来实现高保真视频恢复。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保持（KS统计量）方面表现出更好的去雾性能。

Conclusion: 将基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验相结合，在高保真视频恢复方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

TL;DR: 本文提出FerretNet，一种轻量级神经网络，通过分析生成过程中引入的潜在分布偏差和解码平滑效应，实现高效鲁棒的合成图像检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。

Method: 利用马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性重建合成图像，暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏，并基于此提出仅含110万参数的FerretNet。

Result: 在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，仅使用4类ProGAN数据集训练的FerretNet平均准确率达到97.1%，超越现有最优方法10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet通过分析生成过程中的特定伪影类型，实现了高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测，在跨模型泛化性能上表现优异。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于transformer架构的概念瓶颈模型，专门为视频分类设计，能够处理任意长度的视频序列，通过全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个维度来提升视频动作分类的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，难以处理视频数据中的时间依赖性。视频中的动作和事件需要捕捉跨时间的概念序列（motifs），因此需要将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频领域。

Method: 提出MoTIF框架，采用transformer架构处理视频序列，识别视频中重复出现的语义概念（如物体、属性、动作组件），并通过三个互补视角分析概念：全局重要性、局部相关性和时间依赖性。

Result: 实验结果表明，概念建模范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的分类性能的同时，能够更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频分类领域，为视频动作理解提供了更可解释的分析框架，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多尺度对象等挑战。Vision Mamba虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但过度依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），影响分割精度

Method: SwinMamba受Swin Transformer启发，在前两个阶段进行局部扫描捕获细粒度细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合更广泛的上下文信息。采用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换，实现更鲁棒的特征整合

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: SwinMamba通过有效结合局部和全局特征感知，为遥感图像语义分割提供了优越的解决方案，展现出良好的有效性和潜力

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，通过将可变长度的特征序列打包成固定长度，解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化的问题，同时引入残差分支和注意力驱动的下采样器来提高训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（可达20万）、显著的长度变化（200到20万）和有限的监督，导致数据异质性和冗余性高。传统方法在有限监督下为了保持这种异质性而牺牲训练效率和优化。

Method: 1）打包MIL框架：将多个采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列，实现批量训练同时保持数据异质性；2）残差分支：将多个切片丢弃的特征组合成超切片，使用定制标签进行训练，提供多切片监督并减轻采样带来的特征损失；3）注意力驱动下采样器：压缩两个分支的特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。广泛实验表明，关注计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过解决计算病理学中的序列长度变化、数据异质性和冗余性问题，显著提高了训练效率和模型性能，为计算病理学在基础模型时代的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to

TL;DR: SimDiff是一种模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时重复调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层整合到扩散过程中以确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质，这些方法计算成本高且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过条件化环境参数（如重力、风力）直接集成到去噪过程中。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时重复模拟器调用，并提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制，同时展示了对未见环境参数组合的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将环境参数直接集成到扩散过程中，实现了高效且物理合理的人体运动生成，同时提供了对物理系数的灵活控制。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉架构对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，通过评估1174个预训练模型识别出四个关键设计模式，并提供了理论解释和实用设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉模型的鲁棒性经常被测量，但特定架构设计选择对其的影响很少被剖析。本文旨在理解为什么某些视觉架构对高斯噪声具有固有鲁棒性。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别出四个一致的设计模式，并通过理论分析将这些观察到的相关性转化为因果机制。

Result: 发现四个关键设计模式能显著提高鲁棒性：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及监督ViT而非CLIP ViT，可获得高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。

Conclusion: 研究结果将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释，并建立了实用的即插即用指南，用于设计对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Method: 采用PRISMA-ScR指导的范围综述方法，系统分析手术场景图研究的应用领域、方法论进展和技术发展路径。

Result: 分析显示该领域快速增长，但发现关键的'数据鸿沟'：内视图研究主要使用真实2D视频，而外视图4D建模严重依赖模拟数据。方法上从基础图神经网络发展到专门的基础模型，在手术环境中显著优于通用大视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 手术场景图正在成熟为重要的语义桥梁，支持新一代智能系统提升手术安全性、效率和培训质量，尽管数据标注和实时实现挑战仍然存在，但正在通过新兴技术得到解决。

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality

Conclusion: FASTER为多模态摘要设立了新标准，使金融咨询内容更易获取和实用，并开发了Fin-APT数据集支持相关研究。

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: ASD是一个适配器，使SSL学习者能够在无需任何预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型的情况下，冷启动进行深度图像聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为前提条件，限制了SSL学习者在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 1. 从无标签数据中随机采样伪标签数据，设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；2. 通过跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换来提取实例级类别的高级相似性；3. 利用这些相似性为伪标签数据分配聚类级标签；4. 使用带有聚类级标签的伪标签数据触发在无标签数据上训练的通用SSL学习者进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有微小精度差距（如CIFAR-10上仅差1.33%）。

Conclusion: ASD能够有效实现SSL学习者的冷启动聚类，且能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入的深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽视信息信号，限制了从大模型中获得的收益

Method: 使用奇异零空间引导的扰动来精炼教师特征，在抑制伪影的同时保留信息信号。通过基于LoRA的适配器高效实现这种扰动，只需最小的结构修改

Result: 在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能，生成了更清晰和更可解释的表征

Conclusion: SiNGER框架能够有效解决教师模型中伪影抑制和信息信号保留之间的权衡问题，显著提升学生模型的性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: KDSS可作为轻量级分辨率保持的替代方案，替代密集预处理和降采样方法，适用于任何植物物种和传感器模态。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

Motivation: 现有的FG-BG分解方法在FS-OOD检测中由于过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景块提取策略，导致鲁棒性较低。

Method: 提出学习背景提示来获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后用局部类别相似性优化局部背景相似性；同时提出块自校准调优来灵活选择不同样本的背景块数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，Mambo在OOD检测和近OOD检测设置方面达到了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo框架通过改进的背景相似性学习和灵活的块选择策略，显著提升了FS-OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种图像分割数据集划分方法：IPS（迭代像素分层）和WDES（Wasserstein驱动的进化分层），旨在解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性问题，从而提高模型评估的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但由于分割数据的多标签结构和类别不平衡特性，将其扩展到分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）IPS - 基于标签感知的简单采样方法；2）WDES - 使用遗传算法最小化Wasserstein距离，优化数据集划分间标签分布的相似性。WDES在足够代数下被证明是全局最优的。

Result: 使用新的统计异质性指标评估显示，WDES始终产生更具代表性的划分。在街景、医学影像和卫星图像等多种分割任务中应用WDES，实现了更低的性能方差和改善的模型评估效果。

Conclusion: WDES在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时特别有价值，这些情况下传统划分策略最容易产生偏差。该方法显著提高了分割模型评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度分类提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Method: 使用Creases Transformation（CT）技术设计现实的对抗补丁，在人物与非人物分类任务中测试四个微调的ViT模型。CT技术添加类似于衣物自然褶皱的细微几何变形，评估对抗补丁从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性。

Result: 实验结果显示不同ViT模型存在显著脆弱性差异：攻击成功率从40.04%（google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k）到99.97%（facebook/dino-vitb16），其他两个模型分别为66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 研究证实了对抗补丁从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性，预训练数据集规模和方法强烈影响模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，这对AI系统安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

*Guojun Lei,Rong Zhang,Chi Wang,Tianhang Liu,Hong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTransfer是一种新颖的视频概念迁移架构，通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念迁移。该方法将视频分解为前景主体、背景和运动流三个关键组件，并采用双到单流DiT架构和Chain-of-Prompt机制进行渐进式生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频概念迁移方法在精确控制和编辑性方面存在局限，需要一种能够对视频不同组件进行细粒度控制的架构，以实现高质量和可控的视频概念迁移。

Method: 1）空间分解：将视频分解为前景主体、背景和运动流；2）双到单流DiT架构：支持对视频不同组件的细粒度控制；3）基于随机掩码的自监督预训练策略；4）Chain-of-Prompt机制：将去噪过程分解为三个不同粒度的阶段，利用LLM生成阶段特定指令；5）构建OpenAnimal动物中心视频数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多样参考图像和场景下实现了高质量和可控的视频概念迁移，在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步分解的渐进式范式，为视频概念迁移任务提供了一种精确可控的解决方案，在保持高质量生成的同时显著提升了编辑能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉测试时缩放（VTTS）方法，通过迭代感知增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，模仿人类分层注意力机制，在推理过程中逐步优化视觉关注区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要依赖静态感知阶段，限制了推理能力的发展。需要一种能够像人类一样在推理过程中动态调整感知焦点的方法。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知机制，结合强化学习和时空监督，逐步聚焦高置信度的时空区域。同时构建了VTTS-80K数据集支持该范式。

Result: 实验表明VTTS在超过15个基准测试中平均提升超过5%，Videochat-R1.5模型在视频对话、视频推理和时空感知任务上表现显著优于Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理性能，证明了迭代感知在增强模型理解能力方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect是首个基于概念的可解释性框架，用于系统分析乳腺X光摄影DL视觉模型，通过乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型为神经元标记人类可理解的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DL模型学习的内容对于AI在临床环境中的安全部署至关重要。以往研究主要关注基于像素的可解释性方法，而对模型学习的文本概念关注较少，这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解剖器"，在指定层为神经元标记人类可解释的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。研究了三个关键问题：不同训练数据集下概念学习的差异、微调对概念专业化的影响、以及未被充分代表的乳腺摄影相关概念。

Result: 在乳腺摄影数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，与放射科医生工作流程更一致。任务特定的微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖，表明专业化与泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了关于CNN如何捕获乳腺摄影特定知识的见解，通过比较不同训练数据和微调策略下的模型，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV是一个基于强化学习的视频推理框架，通过动态时间规整（DTW）的过程奖励来解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的过程不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理过程与视频动态不匹配，即使最终答案正确，也影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于DTW的过程奖励机制，将推理轨迹与时间基础参考对齐，实现无需辅助奖励模型的高效过程监督。同时提出动态状态预测作为视频推理的关键衡量指标，并构建MOSS-Video基准数据集。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上表现提升，且在不同架构（如Qwen2.5-VL和Phi-2）上均获得一致增益。

Conclusion: 该框架能产生更一致和稳定的推理轨迹，具有广泛的适用性，为视频推理提供了有效的过程监督解决方案。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别学习相机和物体运动，这可能导致相机与物体之间相对运动的混淆，难以实现一致性和泛化性

Method: 将相机和物体运动转换为对应像素的运动，使用稳定扩散网络学习参考运动图，结合语义物体先验输入图像到视频网络生成视频

Result: 大量实验验证该方法大幅优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够准确跟随指定相机轨迹，同时保持一致的物体运动，解决了相机轨迹引导视频生成中的关键挑战

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像生成AI中判别器在什么条件下最不利，分析了数据维度和数据复杂性两个关键因素，发现中等复杂度的数据集最有利于检测合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像之间的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探讨判别器在什么条件下处于最不利的地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和数据复杂性对判别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：非常简单的数据集和高度复杂的数据集都会降低合成图像的可检测性；而中等复杂度的数据集为检测创造了最有利的条件，因为生成器无法完全捕捉分布，其错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂性对判别器的检测能力有重要影响，中等复杂度的数据集最有利于检测合成图像，这为理解生成器与判别器竞争提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

TL;DR: WAVECLIP是一个统一的CLIP模型，通过基于小波的分词实现自适应分辨率推理，用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，支持从粗到细的图像处理，并在推理时通过低分辨率令牌开始，仅在需要时细化，实现计算重用和自适应提前退出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决CLIP模型在处理不同分辨率图像时的计算效率问题，通过自适应分辨率推理实现计算与精度的动态权衡，减少不必要的计算开销。

Method: 方法包括使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，实现从粗到细的图像处理；在推理时采用低分辨率令牌开始，结合键值缓存和因果跨层注意力重用计算；通过简单的基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应提前退出。

Result: 评估显示，WAVECLIP在零样本分类中表现优异，仅需从冻结的CLIP教师模型进行轻量级蒸馏，即可实现竞争性精度，并显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 结论是WAVECLIP通过小波基分词和自适应推理机制，成功实现了单一模型中多分辨率支持，为用户提供了动态的计算-精度权衡选择，具有高效和实用的优势。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对CLIP模型的量化效果进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅能提高效率，还能改善模型的可靠性指标，挑战了传统的效率-性能权衡观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响（特别是可靠性指标）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模评估量化对CLIP模型的影响，不仅关注分布内精度，还评估了包括校准性和OOD检测在内的全面可靠性指标。

Result: 量化能持续改善预训练不足的模型的校准性，但可能降低过度自信变体的校准性。有趣的是，即使校准性下降，OOD检测仍可能改善。某些量化感知训练方法能同时提高零样本精度、校准性和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化在高效、可靠和鲁棒的视觉语言模型部署中具有超越传统角色的重要作用，为多目标优化问题提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在描述复杂对象关系、属性或空间排列时往往无法实现组合对齐。现有的推理时方法各有局限性：优化可能因初始化不良而停滞，探索可能需要大量样本。

Method: CARINOX框架结合了噪声优化和探索，采用基于人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序，克服了单一奖励指标或临时组合的不可靠性问题。

Result: 在两个互补基准测试中，CARINOX在T2I-CompBench++上平均对齐分数提高了+16%，在HRS基准上提高了+11%，在所有主要类别中均优于最先进的优化和探索方法，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CARINOX通过统一的优化-探索框架和原则性奖励选择，有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有VTU数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 构建包含400万个示例的大规模VTU数据集TABLET，涵盖20个任务，每个示例包含配对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息，链接回源数据集。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型上微调TABLET，提高了在已见和未见VTU任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化效果并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效控制解释的保真度，基于超像素的度量方法更具优势，为可信AI解释提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Conclusion: 证明了语义信息丰富的预训练的重要性，以及骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on

TL;DR: 该论文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的自动指标进行了全面研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，指标性能随组合问题的类型而变化。VQA类指标并非普遍最优，某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术快速发展，但评估生成结果是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度采用，而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 进行了广泛的研究，分析多种流行的组合文本-图像评估指标，超越简单的相关性分析，考察它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示，没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，指标性能随组合问题的类型而变化。VQA类指标并非普遍最优，某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强。仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在可信评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明地选择指标的重要性。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合Mamba架构和图神经网络(GNN)的通用深度学习框架SlideMamba，用于全切片图像(WSI)分析，通过熵置信度加权机制自适应融合局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在同时捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在挑战。

Method: 集成Mamba模块(擅长长距离全局依赖)和GNN(擅长细粒度短距离空间交互)，采用基于熵的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

Result: 在预测基因融合和突变状态任务中，SlideMamba达到PRAUC 0.751±0.05，优于MIL(0.491)、Trans-MIL(0.39)、Mamba-only(0.664)、GNN-only(0.748)和GAT-Mamba(0.703)。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合提出的自适应融合策略在计算病理学中显示出强大潜力，为空间分辨预测建模任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni是一个统一的3D资产生成框架，支持多种模态（图像、点云、体素、边界框、骨骼姿态）作为条件输入，实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每个样本选择一种控制模态，偏重难信号（如骨骼姿态）而降低易信号（如点云）权重。

Result: 实验表明额外控制提高了生成准确性，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过多模态统一框架实现了更精确可控的3D资产生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN模型经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，现有方法依赖专家标注的注意力监督，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到SOTA性能，表现出更好的泛化能力和减少的捷径依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人工标注的可扩展框架，能够引导模型做出更可靠、更符合人类认知的决策。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Conclusion: Decipher-MR为基于MRI的AI提供了一个可扩展且多功能的基础，有助于临床和研究领域的高效开发。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research
domains.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言理解在多步推理方面存在困难，现有LLM方法无法获取细粒度视觉内容且黑盒机制难以复现

Method: 构建包含Questioner、Answerer和Reasoner的三模块架构，通过迭代生成图像感知的子问题和子答案来辅助主问题推理

Result: 实验表明SQ-InstructBLIP在VQA任务中使用生成的子问题作为附加信息时，比先前工作进行更准确的推理

Conclusion: SQ-InstructBLIP通过图像感知的子问题生成机制有效提升了多步推理的准确性

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>

Motivation: 当前对T2I模型的评估主要关注提示与生成内容的对齐度，但忽视了模型基于先验知识或偏见生成超出提示内容的现象，这需要系统性的定义和评估框架。

Method: 提出将语言和视觉语言模型中的幻觉概念框架化应用于T2I领域，定义幻觉为偏见驱动的偏差，并建立包含属性、关系和对象幻觉的三类分类法。

Result: 该框架为T2I模型的评估设定了上限标准，能够揭示隐藏的模型偏见，为更丰富的模型评估提供基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为T2I生成模型的幻觉现象提供了首个系统性定义和分类框架，有助于更全面地评估模型性能并识别其潜在偏见。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代科学模拟和仪器产生的数据量超过了内存和存储的承载能力，限制了可扩展性。现有GPU压缩器虽然提供高吞吐量，但通常采用硬编码的融合内核，阻碍快速实验，且在率失真性能上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FZModules框架，通过简洁可扩展的接口从高性能模块组装误差有界的自定义压缩流水线。利用异步任务支持的执行库推断数据依赖关系、管理内存移动，并暴露分支和阶段级并发，实现强大的异步压缩流水线。

Result: 在四个代表性科学数据集上评估三个使用FZModules构建的流水线，结果显示它们可以达到与融合内核GPU压缩器相当的整体加速比，同时实现与更高保真度CPU或混合压缩器相似的率失真性能。

Conclusion: FZModules框架能够实现快速、领域定制的压缩流水线设计，在保持高吞吐量的同时提供良好的压缩质量。

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations and instruments generate data volumes that
overwhelm memory and storage, throttling scalability. Lossy compression
mitigates this by trading controlled error for reduced footprint and throughput
gains, yet optimal pipelines are highly data and objective specific, demanding
compression expertise. GPU compressors supply raw throughput but often
hard-code fused kernels that hinder rapid experimentation, and underperform in
rate-distortion. We present FZModules, a heterogeneous framework for assembling
error-bounded custom compression pipelines from high-performance modules
through a concise extensible interface. We further utilize an asynchronous
task-backed execution library that infers data dependencies, manages memory
movement, and exposes branch and stage level concurrency for powerful
asynchronous compression pipelines. Evaluating three pipelines built with
FZModules on four representative scientific datasets, we show they can compare
end-to-end speedup of fused-kernel GPU compressors while achieving similar
rate-distortion to higher fidelity CPU or hybrid compressors, enabling rapid,
domain-tailored design.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from
specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph

these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments,
such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC)

computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that
integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads,
helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the

across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our
experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC
container community, guiding future research and tool development.

Result: 在多个集群和超级计算机上的实验表明，该方法在矩阵置换、子图提取等应用场景中性能显著优于CombBLAS和PETSc等现有库

Conclusion: 这项工作为稀疏矩阵置换、提取和分配操作提供了全面的算法研究、软件实现和实验评估，证明了所提方法的有效性

Abstract: We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix
permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an
Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local
nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local
submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication
compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing
synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local
computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing
libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these
operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the
Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application
scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering,
subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare
our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for
these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work
provides a comprehensive study of algorithms, software implementations,
experimental evaluations, and applications for sparse matrix permutation,

Motivation: 科学工作流越来越多地涉及HPC和机器学习任务的结合，但传统的启动器如Slurm的srun在并发性和吞吐量方面存在限制，不适合动态和异构的工作负载。

Method: 将RADICAL-Pilot（RP）与Flux和Dragon两个互补的运行时系统集成，实现分层资源管理和高吞吐量函数执行，并在Frontier系统上使用合成和生产规模的工作负载进行性能研究。

Result: RP+Flux可持续达到930任务/秒，RP+Flux+Dragon超过1,500任务/秒，利用率超过99.6%。相比之下，srun峰值仅为152任务/秒，且随规模增大而性能下降，利用率低于50%。在IMPEccABLE.v2药物发现活动中，RP+Flux相比srun/Slurm将完工时间减少30-60%，吞吐量提高四倍以上。

Conclusion: RP中的混合运行时集成是处理混合AI-HPC工作负载的可扩展方法，显著提升了任务执行性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: Scientific workflows increasingly involve both HPC and machine-learning
tasks, combining MPI-based simulations, training, and inference in a single
execution. Launchers such as Slurm's srun constrain concurrency and throughput,
making them unsuitable for dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. We present a
performance study of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) integrated with Flux and Dragon, two
complementary runtime systems that enable hierarchical resource management and
high-throughput function execution. Using synthetic and production-scale
workloads on Frontier, we characterize the task execution properties of RP
across runtime configurations. RP+Flux sustains up to 930 tasks/s, and
RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. In contrast,
srun peaks at 152 tasks/s and degrades with scale, with utilization below 50%.
For IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux reduces makespan by 30-60%
relative to srun/Slurm and increases throughput more than four times on up to
1,024. These results demonstrate hybrid runtime integration in RP as a scalable

Motivation: Mojo作为首个基于LLVM MLIR编译器基础设施的语言，旨在通过结合Python的互操作性和类CUDA语法来弥合性能和生产力差距，为科学计算和AI融合提供解决方案。

Method: 针对四种科学计算工作负载（七点模板、BabelStream、miniBUDE、Hartree-Fock），在NVIDIA H100和AMD MI300A GPU上比较Mojo与CUDA/HIP的性能表现。

Result: Mojo在内存密集型内核上性能与CUDA和HIP相当，但在AMD GPU上的原子操作以及两个平台上的快速数学计算密集型内核存在性能差距。

Conclusion: 尽管学习曲线和编程要求仍较底层，但Mojo能够在科学计算和AI融合的碎片化Python生态系统中弥合重要差距。

Abstract: We explore the performance and portability of the novel Mojo language for
scientific computing workloads on GPUs. As the first language based on the
LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure,
Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's
interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU
programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil
(memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and
Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their
performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We
show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound
kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math
compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve
and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close
significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of
scientific computing and AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为tail batching的新型rollout调度策略，通过将长尾响应整合到少量专门的long rounds中，显著减少GPU空闲时间，在不牺牲准确性的情况下加速RL训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步RL后训练存在GPU利用率不足的问题，主要由rollout步骤中响应长度不平衡导致的bubbles引起。现有系统通过放松同步性来缓解此问题，但会损害训练准确性。

Method: 引入tail batching策略，系统地将导致长尾响应的prompts整合到少量long rounds中，确保大多数steps只涉及平衡的短rollouts。同时提出RollPacker系统，在rollout、reward和training三个阶段进行全面优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，RollPacker在128个H800 GPU上对Qwen2.5系列LLMs实现了2.03x-2.56x的端到端训练时间减少，相比veRL和RLHFuse分别达到2.24x的加速。

Conclusion: tail batching策略和RollPacker系统有效解决了同步RL训练中的GPU利用率问题，显著提升了训练效率而不影响准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU
underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths
within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by
relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this
paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for
synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail
responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring
that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short
rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them
into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle
time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without
sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the
benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL
stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation
and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show
that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction
compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5

TL;DR: 本文展示了通过利用输入矩阵的稀疏性来改进GPU上Schur补矩阵的组装，在FETI方法中实现了5.1倍的GPU部分加速和3.3倍的整体组装加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高性能计算集群主要依赖GPU，需要将域分解方法中的Schur补矩阵计算也进行GPU加速。传统的显式组装方法开销较大，需要优化GPU上的组装过程。

Method: 通过明智地利用输入矩阵的稀疏性来改进GPU上的Schur补矩阵组装过程，特别是在FETI（有限元撕裂互连）方法的背景下。

Result: 在FETI方法中实现了GPU部分代码5.1倍的加速，整体组装过程3.3倍的加速，使得从仅10次迭代开始就能获得加速效益。

Conclusion: 利用输入矩阵稀疏性可以显著提高GPU上Schur补矩阵的组装效率，使得GPU加速在较少的迭代次数下就能产生实际效益。

Abstract: Schur complement matrices emerge in many domain decomposition methods that
can solve complex engineering problems using supercomputers. Today, as most of
the high-performance clusters' performance lies in GPUs, these methods should
also be accelerated.
  Typically, the offloaded components are the explicitly assembled dense Schur
complement matrices used later in the iterative solver for multiplication with
a vector. As the explicit assembly is expensive, it represents a significant
overhead associated with this approach to acceleration. It has already been
shown that the overhead can be minimized by assembling the Schur complements
directly on the GPU.
  This paper shows that the GPU assembly can be further improved by wisely
utilizing the sparsity of the input matrices. In the context of FETI methods,
we achieved a speedup of 5.1 in the GPU section of the code and 3.3 for the
whole assembly, making the acceleration beneficial from as few as 10
iterations.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对RRAM阵列的分布式内存原始-对偶混合梯度方法，通过算法-硬件协同设计解决大规模优化问题，相比GPU加速求解器实现了三个数量级的能耗和延迟降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构受限于基本限制，无法满足计算工作负载的指数增长需求。内存计算（IMC）虽然提供了有前景的替代方案，但现有算法无法直接应用于IMC，特别是在需要频繁矩阵重编程的约束优化问题中。

Method: 开发了分布式内存原始-对偶混合梯度方法，最小化昂贵的写入周期，包含对设备非理想性的鲁棒性，并利用对称块矩阵公式统一分布式交叉开关的操作。使用MELISO+物理模拟框架评估实际设备条件下的性能。

Result: 在大规模线性程序上对比GPU加速求解器，RRAM求解器实现了相当的精度，同时能耗和延迟降低了三个数量级。

Conclusion: 这是首个在RRAM上实现的PDHG线性规划求解器，展示了算法-硬件协同设计通过分布式内存计算解决大规模优化问题的变革潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the
capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by
fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising
alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency
and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional
architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained
optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains
cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays
of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates
robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric
block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We
integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate
performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against
GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our
RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of
magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results
demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the
transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving
large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出弹性流水线并行（EPP）和InfiniPipe系统，通过自适应选择流水线并行粒度来优化长上下文训练，解决了现有方法在通信开销和内存消耗方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文训练方案存在通信开销大、内存消耗高的问题，且静态调度方法无法适应序列长度的不均匀分布，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出EPP机制协调token级和batch级流水线并行，开发InfiniPipe系统，包含资源感知的序列处理器和联合优化流水线调度与梯度检查点的协同优化方法。

Result: 实验表明InfiniPipe相比最先进系统实现了1.69倍的加速。

Conclusion: EPP和InfiniPipe能有效适应资源和负载异质性，显著提升长上下文训练效率。

Abstract: Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing
schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication
overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的对话式网络管理系统，让非专业用户能够使用自然语言管理网络，降低了网络管理的技术门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络管理方法需要专业知识和训练，限制了普通用户的使用。随着大语言模型的发展，作者希望让更广泛的非专业用户能够通过自然语言对话来管理网络。

Method: 设计了一个基于代理的框架，使用中间表示来统一不同厂商设备的配置，实时从内存中检索网络状态，并提供外部反馈接口。还进行了试点研究收集真实用户的自然语言指令数据。

Result: 初步实验验证了系统组件与大语言模型集成的有效性，在合成和真实用户指令上都表现良好。通过数据收集和可视化工作，为未来开发奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该系统为大语言模型在网络管理中的更有效使用铺平了道路，使日常用户能够民主化地进行网络控制。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a
handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge.
This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without
resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models
(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network
management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to
converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage
advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate
representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,
retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface
for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data
of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization
interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale
data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both
synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and
visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and
democratize network control for everyday users.

Abstract: The integration of satellite communication into 5G has been formalized in
3GPP Release 17 through the specification of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN),
marking a significant step toward achieving global connectivity. However, the
early-stage maturity of 5G NTN standards and the lack of commercial NTN-capable
equipment hinder extensive performance validation and system prototyping. To
address this gap, this paper proposes a software-defined radio (SDR) test
platform with General-Purpose Processor (GPP) processing, leveraging
Amarisoft's 5G NTN protocol stack software while performing custom system
integration and adaptation for real satellite operation. The platform supports
bidirectional communication between an SDR-based NTN gNB and UE emulator
through a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite link, with full compliance
to 3GPP NTN specifications. We provide detailed insights into the system
architecture, SDR hardware-software co-design, and satellite gateway
adaptations. Through field trials, we evaluate the performance metrics
including downlink throughput and round-trip time. Results validate the
feasibility and effectiveness of SDR-based platforms for NTN testing, and
highlight their potential in bridging current implementation gaps before
widespread commercial deployment.

encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning
attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism
to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对等选择算法忽视了应用特定的数据流量，导致连接利用不足、路径更长和延迟增加的问题。

Method: 提出了基于二进制搜索桶（BSB）的需求感知对等选择算法，采用局部贪婪的XOR路由机制，确保与现有协议的兼容性。

Result: 在真实世界和合成通信网络轨迹上的仿真评估显示，BSB相比文献中的两种算法可提供高达43%的性能改进。

Conclusion: BSB算法通过需求感知的方法有效解决了现有算法对数据流量不敏感的问题，显著提升了P2P网络的性能表现。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer networks, as a key enabler of modern networked and distributed
systems, rely on peer-selection algorithms to optimize their scalability and
performance. Peer-selection methods have been studied extensively in various
aspects, including routing mechanisms and communication overhead. However, many
state-of-the-art algorithms are oblivious to application-specific data traffic.
This mismatch between design and demand results in underutilized connections,
which inevitably leads to longer paths and increased latency. In this work, we
propose a novel demand-aware peer-selection algorithm, called Binary Search in
Buckets (BSB). Our demand-aware approach adheres to a local and greedy
XOR-based routing mechanism, ensuring compatibility with existing protocols and
mechanisms. We evaluate our solution against two prior algorithms by conducting
simulations on real-world and synthetic communication network traces. The
results of our evaluations show that BSB can offer up to a 43% improvement
compared to two selected algorithms from the literature.

Motivation: 6G网络面临管理多样化应用QoS和在变化网络条件下实现SLA的挑战，需要自动化网络管理来满足实时需求。

Method: 用户通过自然语言（如英语）提供意图，使用NLP技术（如RAG）转换为Nile语言，然后传递给基于BiLSTM和Q学习的ZTN闭环框架作为目标。

Result: 实验结果表明ZTN能够自主实现用户意图设定的带宽目标，仿真和测试床结果趋势一致，MOS评分显示用户对意图的满意度。

Conclusion: 该集成架构能够通过简单指定用户英语意图来自主确保网络性能目标的实现，为6G网络自动化管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The transition to Sixth Generation (6G) networks presents challenges in
managing quality of service (QoS) of diverse applications and achieving Service
Level Agreements (SLAs) under varying network conditions. Hence, network
management must be automated with the help of Machine Learning (ML) and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve real-time requirements. Zero touch
network (ZTN) is one of the frameworks to automate network management with
mechanisms such as closed loop control to ensure that the goals are met
perpetually. Intent- Based Networking (IBN) specifies the user intents with
diverse network requirements or goals which are then translated into specific
network configurations and actions. This paper presents a novel architecture
for integrating IBN and ZTN to serve the intent goals. Users provides the
intent in the form of natural language, e.g., English, which is then translated
using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., retrieval augmented
generation (RAG)) into Network Intent LanguagE (Nile). The Nile intent is then
passed on to the BiLSTM and Q-learning based ZTN closed loop framework as a
goal which maintains the intent under varying network conditions. Thus, the
proposed architecture can work autonomously to ensure the network performance
goal is met by just specifying the user intent in English. The integrated
architecture is also implemented on a testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI).
Additionally, to evaluate the architecture, an optimization problem is
formulated which evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate
how ZTN can help achieve the bandwidth goals autonomously set by user intent.
The simulation and the testbed results are compared and they show similar
trend. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Quality of Experience (QoE) is also
measured to indicate the user satisfaction of the intent.

Abstract: Reproducing networking research is a critical but challenging task due to the
scarcity of open-source code. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate
code generation, current approaches lack the generalizability required for the
diverse networking field. To address this, we propose RePro, a semi-automated
reproduction framework that leverages advanced prompt engineering to reproduce
network systems from their research papers. RePro combines few-shot in-context
learning with Structured and Semantic Chain of Thought (SCoT/SeCoT) techniques
to systematically translate a paper's description into an optimized, executable
implementation. The framework operates through a three-stage pipeline: system
description extraction, structural code generation, and code optimization. Our
evaluation with five state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse network sub-domains
demonstrates that RePro significantly reduces reproduction time compared to
manual efforts while achieving comparable system performance, validating its
effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: HRD-AirComp方案成功实现了数字通信系统与空中计算的兼容，为6G网络边缘推理提供了一种有效的多视图特征聚合解决方案。

Abstract: The vision of 6G networks aims to enable edge inference by leveraging
ubiquitously deployed artificial intelligence (AI) models, facilitating
intelligent environmental perception for a wide range of applications. A
critical operation in edge inference is for an edge node (EN) to aggregate
multi-view sensory features extracted by distributed agents, thereby boosting
perception accuracy. Over-the-air computing (AirComp) emerges as a promising
technique for rapid feature aggregation by exploiting the waveform
superposition property of analog-modulated signals, which is, however,
incompatible with existing digital communication systems. Meanwhile, hybrid
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a novel RIS architecture capable of
simultaneous signal amplification and reflection, exhibits potential for
enhancing AirComp. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid RIS-aided Digital
AirComp (HRD-AirComp) scheme, which employs vector quantization to map
high-dimensional features into discrete codewords that are digitally modulated
into symbols for wireless transmission. By judiciously adjusting the AirComp
transceivers and hybrid RIS reflection to control signal superposition across
agents, the EN can estimate the aggregated features from the received signals.
To endow HRD-AirComp with a task-oriented design principle, we derive a
surrogate function for inference accuracy that characterizes the impact of
feature quantization and over-the-air aggregation. Based on this surrogate, we
formulate an optimization problem targeting inference accuracy maximization,
and develop an efficient algorithm to jointly optimize the quantization bit
allocation, agent transmission coefficients, EN receiving beamforming, and
hybrid RIS reflection beamforming. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed HRD-AirComp outperforms baselines in terms of both inference accuracy
and uncertainty.

Abstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the
cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to
generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%
reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy
of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original
cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT
and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic
surveillance.

3. 用Ring开发PWCT2可视化编程语言（92,000行Ring代码，394个视觉组件）

Conclusion: 成功开发了自托管的通用可视化编程语言PWCT2，通过双语言方法和自托管设计解决了VPL改进依赖文本编程的问题，获得了用户积极反馈。

Abstract: Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few
general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These
general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and
improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and
developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose,
self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically
designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring
is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering
syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific
languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming,
allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or
Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using
the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is
composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which
increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to
develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the
development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual
programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code
generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also
allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation
of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of
approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components.
PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received
positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the
total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research
and development.

Motivation: 符号计算系统存在内存效率低下的问题，结构相同的子表达式冗余存储导致表达式膨胀，影响经典计算机代数和新兴AI驱动数学推理工具的性能。

Conclusion: hash consing对于扩展符号计算规模至关重要，为未来将hash consing与e-graphs集成以实现AI驱动管道中增强的等价感知表达式共享铺平了道路。

Abstract: Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to
redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as
expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra
and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present
the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance
symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that
canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces
memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation,
simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's
metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark
evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial
improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory
usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster,
function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100
times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate
unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in
initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits
significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in
scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash
consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in
AI-driven pipelines.

### [200] [ACCeLLiuM: Supervised Fine-Tuning for Automated OpenACC Pragma Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20380)
*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM是专门为数据并行循环生成专家级OpenACC指令的微调大语言模型，显著提升了OpenACC pragma生成的准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU硬件和并行编程框架日益复杂，虽然OpenACC等指令式编程标准简化了GPU编程，但仍需要专业知识才能有效使用这些指令。

Method: 构建了包含4,033个OpenACC pragma-loop对的监督微调数据集，并基于此训练了两个专门的大语言模型。

Result: 在测试集上，基础LLM无法一致生成有效pragma，而微调后的模型能为87%的数据并行循环生成正确指令类型的pragma，50%的情况下能生成完全匹配的pragma。

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM显著降低了自动化GPU卸载的门槛，为LLM驱动的OpenACC pragma生成建立了可复现的基准。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Dynamic ReAct是一种新颖方法，使ReAct智能体能够在超出大型语言模型上下文内存限制的庞大MCP工具集下高效运行，通过搜索-加载机制减少50%工具加载量同时保持任务完成精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在包含数百或数千个可用工具的环境中，由于计算不可行而无法同时加载所有工具时，工具选择的基本挑战

Method: 提出并评估了五种不同的架构，逐步优化工具选择过程，最终实现搜索-加载机制，以最小计算开销实现智能工具选择

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法将工具加载量减少高达50%，同时保持任务完成准确性

Conclusion: 该方法推进了真正通用AI智能体的发展路径，使其能够动态适应多样化的任务环境

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于AI-Python的聊天机器人，通过结合静态代码分析、动态执行追踪和大型语言模型，帮助学生解决编程问题，提高学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程工具如IDE和静态分析器缺乏机器人辅助，而AI驱动的代码助手如GitHub Copilot主要关注代码完成。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提供具有教育意义的编程辅助。

Method: 采用混合架构：使用CodeLlama进行代码嵌入，GPT-4处理自然语言交互，Docker沙箱确保安全执行。通过静态代码分析和动态执行追踪提供实用建议。

Result: 在1,500份学生提交中测试，系统错误解决成功率达85%，优于pylint（62%）和GPT-4（73%）。调试时间减少59.3%，编程熟练度提高34%，尤其在递归和异常处理方面。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了AI工具如何平衡技术创新与教学关怀，优先考虑教育公平和长期技能保留，而不仅仅是代码完成，为编程教育提供了增强人类教学的蓝图。

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

*Qusai Ramadan,Jukka Ruohonen,Abhishek Tiwari,Adam Alami,Zeyd Boukhers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出开发基于知识图谱的公平性框架，以解决软件系统中因缺乏明确公平性要求和验证机制而导致的歧视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将软件系统中的歧视问题归因于算法设计缺陷或数据偏见，但忽视了公平性要求规范不明确及其验证机制缺失这一根本原因。专家关于公平性的知识往往是隐性的，这使得制定精确且可验证的公平性要求变得困难。

Method: 借鉴安全工程领域的经验，提出使用知识图谱来形式化公平性知识，以辅助需求规范和验证。论文讨论了相关挑战、研究问题，并制定了解决这些研究问题的路线图。

Result: 提出了一个基于知识图谱的公平性框架开发方案，旨在为软件系统提供形式化的公平性要求和验证机制。

Conclusion: 通过知识图谱的形式化方法，可以有效解决公平性要求规范不明确的问题，为构建更公平的软件系统提供理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

*Yu Pan,Xiaocheng Li,Hanzhao Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出Online-Optimized RAG框架，通过在线梯度更新解决检索增强生成中的嵌入对齐问题，提高工具选择和任务成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中由于不完美的嵌入模型或噪声描述导致的嵌入错位问题，这种错位可能导致错误检索和任务失败

Method: 部署时框架，通过最小化反馈（如任务成功）从实时交互中持续调整检索嵌入，使用轻量级在线梯度更新，不改变底层LLM

Result: 在多样化工具使用和文档检索场景中，持续提高工具选择准确性和最终任务成功率

Conclusion: 为构建稳健、自我改进的RAG系统提供简单实用的路径

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

TL;DR: Stipula是一种领域特定编程语言，用于建模具有可执行属性的法律合同，特别是涉及资产转移和义务的合同。本文提出了一种通过将Stipula合同转换为带有Java建模语言规范的Java代码来形式化验证其正确性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种方法来形式化验证法律合同的正确性，特别是那些涉及资产转移和义务的合同，以确保合同条款的准确执行和避免潜在的法律风险。

Method: 将Stipula合同翻译成带有Java建模语言规范的Java代码，并使用演绎验证工具KeY作为验证后端。对于具有不相交循环的大型Stipula合同子集，翻译和部分及完全正确性验证都是完全自动化的。

Result: 成功展示了通用目的的演绎验证工具可以在翻译方法中有效使用，实现了对Stipula合同的自动形式化验证。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了使用通用验证工具通过翻译方法验证领域特定语言合同的可行性，为法律合同的形式化验证提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

TL;DR: SpecDetect4AI是一个基于工具的方法，用于大规模规范化和检测AI特定代码异味，通过声明性DSL和静态分析工具实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统的兴起带来了新的软件问题，现有检测工具往往无法识别AI特定的代码异味，这些异味可能导致不可重现性、静默故障或模型泛化能力差等问题。

Method: 结合高级声明性领域特定语言（DSL）进行规则规范，以及可扩展的静态分析工具来解析和检测AI系统中的这些规则。

Result: 在826个AI系统（2000万行代码）上评估，实现了88.66%的精确度和88.89%的召回率，优于现有检测工具，SUS评分为81.7/100。

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI通过专用规则有效支持AI特定代码异味的规范化和检测，能够高效分析大型AI系统，展示了效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

TL;DR: 本文首次对LLM集成中的技术债务进行了大规模实证研究，发现OpenAI集成是主要债务来源(54.49%)，提示设计是主要债务类型(6.61%)，其中基于指令的提示(38.60%)和少样本提示(18.13%)最易产生债务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM通过API集成到软件中，这些集成带来了新的技术债务形式，但缺乏对LLM特定技术债务的系统研究。

Method: 通过分析93,142个Python文件中的主要LLM API使用情况，识别和分类LLM特定的技术债务实例。

Result: 研究发现54.49%的技术债务来自OpenAI集成，12.35%来自LangChain使用；提示设计是主要债务来源(6.61%)，其中指令提示和少样本提示最易产生债务。

Conclusion: LLM集成带来了显著的技术债务，特别是与提示设计相关的债务，研究提供了管理LLM系统技术债务的实用指南和数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc是一个新颖的故障定位框架，通过将大语言模型与检索增强生成技术结合，显著提升了方法级故障定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的故障定位方法在处理复杂系统时面临项目特定知识缺乏和大项目导航困难的问题。

Method: FaR-Loc包含三个关键组件：LLM功能提取模块生成故障行为描述，语义密集检索组件在共享语义空间中嵌入功能描述和覆盖方法，LLM重排序模块基于上下文相关性重新排序检索到的方法。

Result: 在Defects4J基准测试中，FaR-Loc在Top-1准确率上比SoapFL和AutoFL分别提升14.6%和9.1%，在Top-5准确率上分别提升19.2%和22.1%，且无需重新训练即可超越所有基于学习和基于频谱的基线方法。

Conclusion: FaR-Loc通过结合LLM和RAG技术有效解决了复杂系统中的故障定位挑战，特别是整合代码结构的预训练嵌入模型能显著提升性能达49.0%。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

distribution of programming language topics within source code becomes
increasingly important for guiding technical decisions, improving onboarding,

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过多模态方法分析混合会议中的参与度模式，发现现场和远程参与者的参与度相当，但远程参与者在长时间会议中参与度较低。主动角色、会议规模和会议时间都会影响参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行后混合工作的广泛采用改变了软件开发实践，带来了新的沟通协作挑战。远程参与会议可能导致远程团队成员的孤立、疏离和参与度下降，需要研究混合会议中的参与度模式。

Method: 研究了三家软件公司的专业人士数周时间，采用多模态方法测量参与度，包括自我报告问卷和生物识别设备的生理测量。

Result: 回归分析显示现场和远程参与者参与度相当，但远程参与者在长时间会议中参与度较低。主动角色与更高参与度正相关，而大型会议和下午会议与较低参与度相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为混合会议中的参与度和脱离因素提供了见解，并提出了潜在的会议改进建议，这些见解不仅适用于软件团队，也适用于面临类似混合协作挑战的知识密集型组织。

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成数据验证的瓶颈问题，提出了验证天花板概念，并探讨了验证策略对模型性能的影响。研究发现当前验证过程过于严格，通过调整验证阈值和采用LLM软验证可以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成模型越来越多地依赖合成数据，验证过程的质量和多样性受到验证器能力的限制，形成了验证天花板瓶颈。需要系统研究验证策略如何影响模型性能。

Method: 通过分析测试复杂度、数量、验证阈值等维度，研究验证设计对代码生成的影响。包括测试套件丰富度、数量效应、100%通过标准的限制性、LLM软验证等方法。

Result: 更丰富的测试套件平均提升3个pass@1点；允许宽松验证阈值或LLM软验证可提升2-4个pass@1点；保留每个问题的多样化正确解决方案能带来一致的泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证实践过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性。但验证不能完全丢弃，需要重新校准。通过结合校准验证与多样化问题-解决方案对，可以突破验证天花板，开发更强的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练语言模型的代码搜索方法面临两个关键挑战：人类意图与机器执行逻辑之间的语义鸿沟，以及对不同代码风格的有限鲁棒性。

Method: PseudoBridge采用两阶段方法：1）使用LLM合成伪代码实现NL查询与伪代码的显式对齐；2）引入逻辑不变代码风格增强策略，生成风格多样但逻辑等价的代码实现，并将不同风格的代码片段与伪代码对齐。

Result: 在10个不同PLM和6种主流编程语言上的实验表明，PseudoBridge持续优于基线方法，在检索准确性和泛化性方面取得显著提升，特别是在零样本领域迁移场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过伪代码实现显式逻辑对齐是有效的，PseudoBridge展示了作为稳健、可泛化代码检索解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

TL;DR: CodeHinter是一个结合传统调试工具和LLM技术的调试助手，旨在帮助编程新手修复语义错误，同时促进他们在调试过程中的主动参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI调试工具容易导致学生对AI过度依赖，缺乏主动参与调试过程。需要设计一个既能有效修复错误又能促进学生主动学习的调试工具。

Method: 结合传统调试工具和LLM技术，开发CodeHinter调试助手，通过第二版设计迭代并在本科生群体中进行测试。

Result: 学生认为该工具在解决语义错误方面非常有效，且比第一版显著更易使用。错误定位是最有价值的功能。

Conclusion: AI辅助调试工具应该基于用户画像进行个性化设计，以优化与学生的互动效果。

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Stack Overflow上的量子计算相关帖子，识别量子软件工程中的常见挑战，并开发基于Transformer的自动分类模型，准确率达到95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子开发者面临优化量子计算和量子软件工程概念的挑战，但现有的量子标签主要关注技术方面而非开发者问题。通过分类量子概念相关的问题可以帮助识别频繁的QSE挑战。

Method: 从问答平台提取2829个量子相关标签的问题，通过内容分析和扎根理论识别常见挑战（工具、理论、学习、概念、错误、API使用等），使用ChatGPT验证人工标注，并比较BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa等Transformer模型与深度/机器学习分类器的性能。

Result: 基于Transformer的方法（BERT DistilBERT）平均准确率达到95%，显著优于深度学习方法（FNN 89%、CNN 86%、LSTM 84%），准确率提升6%。使用SHAP增强模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 该分类方法能帮助量子供应商和论坛更好地组织讨论内容，提高可访问性和可读性，但需要与实际开发者和供应商进行实证评估研究。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MelcotCR，一种基于思维链（COT）的微调方法，通过利用长COT技术提供丰富的结构化信息，训练LLMs具备分析代码审查多个维度的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代码审查数据微调LLMs的方法受限于有限或模糊的信息，无法像人类审查者那样同时分析代码审查的多个维度来更好地识别问题。

Method: 结合最大熵建模原则和预定义推理路径，解决LLMs处理长COT提示时常见的上下文丢失和推理逻辑丢失问题，提高长COT提示中上下文知识的有效利用并加强推理过程的逻辑严密性。

Result: 在MelcotCR数据集和公开CodeReviewer数据集上的实证评估显示，使用MelcotCR微调的14B Qwen2.5基础模型在检测和描述代码问题的准确性上超越了现有最先进方法，性能与671B DeepSeek-R1模型相当。

Conclusion: MelcotCR方法通过思维链微调显著提升了LLMs在代码审查任务中的推理能力，使小参数模型能够达到甚至超越大参数模型的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合BERTopic、种子词和大型语言模型自动验证的方法，用于解决数字平台公民参与内容的大规模分类挑战，使政府能够将大量公民意见转化为可操作的公共政策数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字平台如Brasil Participativo的普及，政府面临大量公民参与内容难以有效利用的挑战：手动分类不可行、需要专家参与、需要与官方分类体系对齐。

Method: 采用BERTopic主题建模方法，结合种子词引导和大型语言模型的自动验证机制，实现公民参与内容的自动分类。

Result: 初步结果表明，生成的主题具有连贯性且与机构分类体系对齐，仅需极少的人工干预。

Conclusion: 该方法能够帮助政府有效处理大规模公民参与数据，为公共政策制定提供可操作的数据支持。

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

TL;DR: 使用预训练的LLM对监狱中8-12万条书面确认和矫正交流进行嵌入分析，发现这些嵌入向量比传统协变量更能预测累犯率。通过零样本分类降维并保留预测能力，同时用新的多元同伴效应模型分析语言使用的社会动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究监狱环境中语言使用的同伴效应，探索LLM嵌入在预测累犯和社会动态分析中的应用价值，为矫正政策提供数据支持。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成文本嵌入向量，进行零样本分类降维，开发新的多元同伴效应模型处理稀疏网络和潜在变量，调整网络内生性问题。

Result: AI嵌入向量预测累犯的准确率比传统协变量高30%，发现语言使用中存在显著的同伴效应，特别是在互动和反馈方面。

Conclusion: LLM生成的文本嵌入是预测累犯的有效工具，新的同伴效应模型为分析矫正设施中的社会动态提供了方法论支持，对矫正政策有重要启示。

Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文比较了Kleibergen-Paap（KP）秩检验和传统J检验作为异方差稳健的过度识别检验，发现KP检验通常表现更好，而J检验容易出现严重的尺寸扭曲。作者建议在弱工具变量情况下使用KP检验而非J检验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工具变量估计中，外生性假设至关重要，可以通过过度识别检验来评估。传统J检验在弱工具变量和异方差情况下存在性能问题，需要寻找更稳健的检验方法。

Method: 推导了J检验和KP检验在异方差弱工具变量情况下的极限分布，将其分别视为通过2SLS和LIML估计的稳健得分检验的特例。通过蒙特卡洛模拟比较两种检验的性能。

Result: 蒙特卡洛模拟显示KP检验通常比J检验表现更好，J检验容易出现严重的尺寸扭曲。在生命周期消费模型中估计跨期替代弹性时，J检验经常拒绝有效工具变量的原假设，而KP检验则不拒绝。

Conclusion: 建议在弱工具变量情况下使用基于LIML的KP检验而非基于2SLS的J检验。工具变量无效性/模型误设不太可能是文献中跨期替代弹性估计值范围广泛的原因。

Abstract: Exogeneity is key for IV estimators, which can assessed via
overidentification (OID) tests. We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test
as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We
derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP
as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML
respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than
J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model
parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative
approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID
tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption
models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but
frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates
for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J
often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects,
sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We
also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of
the range of EIS estimates in the literature.

TL;DR: 本文通过整合现有系统综述和元分析，对劳动力市场的非正规性、最低工资影响和买方垄断权力三个相互关联领域进行了综合分析，发现传统观点往往高估了这些效应的规模，并揭示了普遍存在的发表偏倚问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合现有关于劳动力市场三个关键领域（非正规性、最低工资影响、买方垄断权力）的研究成果，检验传统观点的准确性，并为观察到的经验规律提供理论基础。

Method: 采用元分析方法，整合多个现有系统综述和元分析的研究发现，同时引入一个包含企业异质性、买方垄断权力和内生正规化决策的综合理论模型。

Result: 研究发现传统观点高估了效应规模；仅降低正规化成本的政策效果有限，而加强执法更有效；最低工资对就业的影响较小；所有研究领域都存在显著的发表偏倚，校正后的估计值趋近于零。

Conclusion: 元回归分析是识别异质性和真实效应的关键工具，需要重新校准理论和政策建议，采用更细致和综合的方法。

Abstract: This document offers a synthesis of recent economic literature on three
interconnected areas of labor markets: informality, the effects of the minimum
wage, and monopsony power. Through the consolidation and meta-analysis of
findings from multiple existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, their
causes, consequences, and associated public policies are examined. It is
concluded that conventional views on these topics often overestimate the
magnitude of effects. Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering
formalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the
extensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage
on employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently
modest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains. To
reconcile and microfound these findings, an integrated theoretical model of
firm optimization is introduced, simultaneously incorporating firm
heterogeneity, monopsony power, and endogenous formality decisions, rigorously
demonstrating how the interaction of these forces can explain the observed
empirical regularities. A cross-cutting and significant finding is the
omnipresence of publication bias across all these study areas, which tends to
inflate the magnitude of the effects reported in the published literature.
Corrected estimates of the effects generally approach zero. Meta-regression is
established as an indispensable tool for identifying heterogeneity and the true
underlying effects in the empirical evidence, compelling a recalibration of
both theory and economic policy recommendations towards a more nuanced and
integrated approach.

Motivation: 传统观点认为纳什实施需要可分离性、拟线性或无限行动集等严格假设，但本文旨在突破这些限制，探索在更一般条件下实现机制设计的可能性。

Method: 研究随机有限行动机制，分析占优策略和迭代占优策略的实施条件，建立可能性和不可能性结果。

Result: 解决了Börgers(1995)中的开放性问题，首次在不需要传统严格假设的条件下获得了积极结果。

Conclusion: 证明了在随机有限行动机制框架下，即使没有可分离性、拟线性或无限行动集等传统假设，也能实现占优策略和迭代占优策略的有效实施。

Abstract: Focusing on stochastic finite-action mechanisms, we study implementation in
undominated strategies and iteratively undominated strategies. We establish
both possibility and impossibility results that resolve the open question in
B\"orgers (1995). Contrary to the conventional understanding that positive
results on Nash implementation need separability, quasilinearity, or infinite
action sets, we provide -- to our knowledge -- the first positive result beyond
those demanding assumptions.

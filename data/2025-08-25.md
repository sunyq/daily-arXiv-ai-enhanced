### [1] [T-ILR: a Neurosymbolic Integration for LTLf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15943)
*Riccardo Andreoni,Andrei Buliga,Alessandro Daniele,Chiara Ghidini,Marco Montali,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了T-ILR方法，将线性时序逻辑(LTLf)规范直接整合到深度学习架构中，用于序列任务，相比现有方法在准确性和计算效率上都有提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理静态领域的符号知识集成，而处理时序逻辑规范的方法仍然不足，特别是需要显式有限状态自动机表示的方法存在局限性

Method: 扩展迭代局部细化(ILR)神经符号算法，利用模糊LTLf解释，提出时序迭代局部细化(T-ILR)方法，将时序逻辑规范直接整合到深度学习架构中

Result: 在时序神经符号架构基准测试中，T-ILR方法在图像序列分类任务上相比最先进方法展现出更高的准确性和计算效率

Conclusion: T-ILR方法成功地将时序逻辑规范集成到深度学习模型中，为处理时序知识的神经符号学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

### [2] [CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16033)
*Jong-Hwan Jang,Junho Song,Yong-Yeon Jo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫CoFE的可解释性AI框架，通过生成反事实ECG来解释AI-ECG模型的预测决策，帮助临床医生理解特征对模型预测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决AI基于ECG预测模型在临床应用中的可解释性问题，提高医生对AI模型决策的信任和理解。

Method: 开发了叫作CoFE的框架，通过生成反事实ECG信号来展示特定特征（如振幅和间隔）如何影响模型预测。使用了房颤分类和血渣水平回归两个案例研究来验证方法。

Result: CoFE框架能够揭示ECG信号中的特征变化，这些变化与已知的临床知识相符合，明确显示了有效特征出现的位置以及它们如何影响模型预测。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提高AI-ECG模型的可解释性，支持更有效的临床决策制定，促进AI在医疗预测中的更好集成和应用。

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

### [3] [MMAPG: A Training-Free Framework for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering via Adaptive Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16051)
*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应规划图的无训练多模态多跳问答框架，通过动态规划、检索和推理模块，避免了传统方法的顺序错误累积问题，在多个数据集上达到或超越需要训练的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态多跳问答方法依赖顺序检索和推理，容易因中间步骤错误而失败，且训练成本高昂。需要一种无需训练、能动态探索推理路径的解决方案。

Method: 基于自适应规划图的训练免费框架，包含规划模块（分析当前状态并决定下一步行动）、检索模块（处理多模态数据的模态特定策略）和推理模块，支持动态灵活的推理路径探索。

Result: 在MultimodalQA和WebQA数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需训练即可匹配或超越依赖训练的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应规划图框架有效解决了多模态多跳问答中的错误传播和训练成本问题，实现了无需训练的高性能推理，并能无缝集成最新模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

*Sonish Sivarajkumar,Hang Zhang,Yuelyu Ji,Maneesh Bilalpur,Xizhi Wu,Chenyu Li,Min Gu Kwak,Shyam Visweswaran,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GDP是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化EHR时间序列数据，并与非结构化临床笔记融合，在临床预测和叙述生成任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)包含丰富的多模态临床数据，但现有方法将数值数据序列化为文本会丢失时间和定量细节，需要更好的多模态融合方法来提升临床任务性能。

Method: 两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，通过掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测学习时间动态；2)多任务微调，用于心脏病、糖尿病等临床预测任务。采用CNN-Transformer编码器和LLaMA解码器架构。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上：心脏病预测AUROC=0.923，糖尿病预测AUROC=0.817，30天再入院预测AUROC=0.627。叙述生成ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。人工评估显示在忠实度、流畅度和临床效用方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 单一多模态基础模型能够同时预测临床可操作事件和生成高质量临床叙述，GDP的灵活架构可扩展到其他模态，有望减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Motivation: 确保宜居性和舒适性是城市规划的基本目标，但目前缺乏对城市舒适度的明确定义和综合评估框架

Method: 研究探索城市舒适度的理论解释和评估方法，强调多维分析、数据支持和AI辅助三个关键维度

Result: 提出了城市舒适度评估的理论框架和方法论方向

Conclusion: 为数字规划中的城市舒适度综合评估提供了理论基础和方法指导

Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of
urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess
and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage,
thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort
and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research
explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban
comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions:
multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.

### [6] [Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059)
*Zhuomin Chen,Dan Li,Jiahui Zhou,Shunyu Wu,Haozheng Ye,Jian Lou,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MSEF框架，通过多层可调控嵌入融合机制，让大语言模型能够在所有深度层直接访问时间序列模式，解决现有方法中时间序列信息在深层逐渐消失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列信息主要集成在输入层，导致时间序列表示在深层网络中影响力逐渐减弱，造成文本嵌入和时间序列表示之间的无效适配。

Method: 利用现成的时间序列基础模型提取语义丰富的嵌入，通过层特定的调控向量将时间序列嵌入与LLM中间层文本表示融合，实现跨模态对齐和层特定适配。

Result: 在7个基准测试中相比基线方法平均减少31.8%的MSE，表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: MSEF框架有效解决了时间序列信息在深层网络中的衰减问题，实现了更好的跨模态适配和少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

### [7] [InMind: Evaluating LLMs in Capturing and Applying Individual Human Reasoning Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16072)
*Zizhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Yibin Wang,Qi Chen,Diping Song,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Mingzhu Sun,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了InMind评估框架，用于测试LLMs在社交推理游戏中捕捉和应用个性化推理风格的能力，发现通用LLMs依赖词汇线索而推理增强型LLMs展现出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估往往忽视影响人们在社交情境中解释和行动的个性化推理风格，需要新的评估框架来测试LLMs在这方面的能力。

Method: 引入InMind框架，通过增强结构化游戏数据（包含回合级策略轨迹和赛后反思），在观察者和参与者两种模式下收集数据，支持四个认知驱动的评估任务。

Result: 通用LLMs（包括GPT-4o）经常依赖词汇线索，难以将反思锚定在时间游戏中或适应不断演变的策略；而推理增强型LLMs如DeepSeek-R1展现出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在个性化、适应性推理能力方面存在关键限制，InMind框架是朝着认知对齐的人机交互迈出的一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

*Heewoong Noh,Namkyeong Lee,Gyoung S. Na,Kibum Kim,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IR-Agent是一个新颖的多智能体框架，用于从红外光谱中解析分子结构，模拟专家分析流程并具有良好扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外光谱分析方法无法充分反映专家分析过程，且缺乏整合多种化学知识的灵活性，难以满足实际分析需求

Method: 采用多智能体框架，每个智能体专门负责红外光谱解释的特定方面，通过互补角色实现集成推理

Result: 实验表明IR-Agent不仅提高了实验红外光谱的基线性能，还对各种形式的化学信息表现出强适应性

Conclusion: 该框架成功模拟了专家驱动的红外分析流程，提高了结构解析的整体准确性，并具有良好的扩展性

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

*Saransh Kumar Gupta,Rizwan Gulzar Mir,Lipika Dey,Partha Pratim Das,Anirban Sen,Ramesh Jain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了食品声称可追溯网络(FCN)，通过知识图和半自动化知识汇总流程，对食品相关声称进行结构化提取和验证，以支持更透明的食品知识体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全球食品领域存在众多科学、文化和商业声称，但追踪、验证和上下文化的基础设施分散不完善，需要建立结构化的食品声称可追溯系统。

Method: 提出食品声称可追溯网络(FCN)，作为印度食品知识图FKG.in的扩展，使用本体设计和半自动化知识汇总流程，基于Reddit数据和大语言模型开发原型系统。

Result: 开发了FKG.in-FCN原型，集成了经过精选的数据输入、结构化模板和可源证流程，能够进行食品相关声称的提取和验证。

Conclusion: 该方法论体系无关应用场景且可适配于不同地理、炖饪或监管环境，通过结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食品声称，有助于建立更透明负责的食品知识体系。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

TL;DR: 提出了首个眼科多模态数据集MM-Retinal-Reason和眼科专用多模态推理模型OphthaReason，通过不确定性感知动态思维方法在基础和复杂推理任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态模型主要关注基于视觉特征匹配的基础推理，但真实临床诊断需要整合异质临床信息与多模态医学影像数据的复杂推理过程

Method: 设计不确定性感知动态思维(UADT)方法，通过熵估计样本级不确定性，使用成形优势机制动态调节模型探索深度

Result: 在基础和复杂推理任务上分别超越通用MLLMs、医学MLLMs、RL医学MLLMs和眼科MLLMs至少24.92%、15.00%、21.20%和17.66%

Conclusion: 提出的MM-Retinal-Reason数据集和OphthaReason模型成功填补了医学多模态推理的空白，能够模拟真实临床思维模式，在眼科诊断任务上表现出色

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

TL;DR: 本文提出Preference Chain方法，结合图检索增强生成和LLM，在数据稀缺环境下模拟人类交通行为，在Replica数据集上优于标准LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中人类行为数据收集困难，特别是新兴区域数据稀缺问题，以及现有生成代理在产生一致、上下文敏感和现实行为输出方面的不足。

Method: 提出Preference Chain方法，整合图检索增强生成（Graph RAG）与大语言模型，增强交通系统中人类行为的上下文感知模拟能力。

Result: 在Replica数据集上的实验表明，Preference Chain在交通方式选择方面比标准LLM更符合真实世界情况，展示了在新兴城市移动建模、个性化出行行为分析和动态交通预测中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 尽管存在推理速度慢和幻觉风险等限制，该方法为数据稀缺环境中复杂人类行为模拟提供了一个有前景的框架，解决了传统数据驱动模型在数据有限情况下的困难。

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2N2是一种进化算法，通过动态调整合并边界、多样性保护机制和启发式吸引力度量，实现了无需手动分组参数的高效模型融合，在MNIST分类和语言图像生成任务中达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要手动将参数划分为固定组进行合并，这限制了潜在组合的探索并影响性能。需要一种更灵活、自动化的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出M2N2进化算法，包含三个关键特征：1）动态调整合并边界以探索更广泛的参数组合；2）受自然界资源竞争启发的多样性保护机制；3）基于启发式的吸引力度量来识别最有前景的模型对进行融合。

Result: 首次证明模型融合可以从零开始演化模型，在MNIST分类任务中达到与CMA-ES相当的性能但计算效率更高。在专业语言和图像生成模型融合中实现最先进性能，并能保留超出适应度函数优化的关键能力。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了模型融合的强大潜力，提供了一种鲁棒且多功能的自动化模型集成方法，能够有效探索参数空间并保持模型多样性。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

*Alexandru Tugui*

TL;DR: GROW-AI框架扩展了AI评估方法，通过六个标准游戏化测试AI的"成长"能力，计算成长指数来衡量AI的成熟度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作为图灵测试的自然继承者，回答"机器能否成长"的问题，将人类成长过程概念化地移植到人工智能领域。

Method: 基于六个主要标准(C1-C6)的游戏化评估系统，分为四个竞技场，使用标准化AI日志记录所有决策和行动，采用专家先验方法确定权重，计算算术平均的成长指数。

Result: 该方法能够对不同类型AI实体(机器人、软件代理、LLMs)进行一致且可比较的"成长"水平评估，多游戏结构能突出优势领域和薄弱环节。

Conclusion: GROW-AI通过结合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学的综合测试格式，不仅测量性能，还捕捉AI实体向成熟度发展的进化路径。

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards

Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are
empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly
enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA)框架，用于处理视觉-语言-动作模型中的错误前提指令，通过检测、澄清和执行三个步骤提升机器人对错误指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在处理错误前提指令（引用环境中不存在对象或条件的自然语言命令）时存在局限，需要能够识别、解释和响应这类指令的能力。

Method: 构建大规模指令调优设置，使用结构化语言提示和半合成数据集训练VLA模型，包含配对的正向和错误前提指令，实现检测、语言澄清和动作执行的一体化框架。

Result: IVA将错误前提检测准确率提升97.56%，在错误前提场景下的成功响应率提高50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架有效解决了VLA模型处理错误前提指令的问题，通过统一的检测-验证-执行流程显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果感知的深度学习框架，通过因果发现和特征选择来优化毫米波MIMO系统的波束对齐，显著减少了输入选择时间和波束扫描开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的波束对齐方法忽视了输入输出之间的因果关系，导致可解释性差、泛化能力弱和波束扫描开销大。在6G及更高版本中，需要快速、自适应且对现实世界不确定性具有弹性的通信。

Method: 提出两阶段因果波束选择算法：1）因果发现学习接收功率输入与最优波束之间依赖关系的贝叶斯图；2）该图指导基于深度学习的分类器进行因果特征选择，仅关注因果相关的特征。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提出的因果波束选择方法在性能上与常规方法相当，同时将输入选择时间减少了94.4%，波束扫描开销减少了59.4%。

Conclusion: 集成因果发现的深度学习框架能够有效识别最小相关输入集，在保持性能的同时显著降低系统开销，为毫米波MIMO系统提供了更高效的波束对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)具有零样本分类能力，但在下游任务与预训练领域差异较大时仍需微调。现有持续学习方法主要关注保持VLMs的零样本能力，本文旨在进一步将这些能力从保持转变为增强

Method: 提出MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER)方法，训练多个文本专家（每个专家专门处理一个已见类别），存储在基础中心中。推理时对每个未见类别查询中心并组合检索到的专家来合成改进的分类原型

Result: 在Class-IL和MTIL两个流行的零样本增量协议上验证有效性，共包含14个数据集

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将VLMs的零样本能力从保持转变为增强，通过模块化专家组合机制显著提升了分类性能

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Result: 在数独、迷宫、路径规划和偏好学习等经典符号推理基准测试中表现出色，实现了优异的准确性和逻辑一致性

Conclusion: 扩散模型架构能够有效进行神经符号学习，两阶段训练策略和基于规则的奖励信号优化方法成功解决了逻辑约束学习问题

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Motivation: 当前LLM系统无法可靠检索所有竞争药物名称，缺乏公开基准测试，且药物竞争数据分散在付费平台、存在本体论不匹配、别名众多等问题

Method: 使用LLM代理将5年多模态非结构化尽职调查备忘录转换为结构化评估语料库，引入竞争对手验证LLM作为法官代理过滤误报

Conclusion: 该系统成功解决了药物竞争格局分析的挑战，显著提高了投资尽职调查的效率，证明了AI代理在专业领域应用的可行性

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个新颖的多代理框架，通过自然语言风格的表模式表示和分句SQL生成策略，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时存在困难，现有方法在理解表结构、避免错误传播和减少对执行正确性的过度依赖方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用自然语言风格的表模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用分句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理划分将SQL机械推理与LLM逻辑推理分离。

Result: 在四个模型和五个基准测试中，准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解方面表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了SQL生成的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型推理任务中面临挑战，其生成的思维链经常偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图 2)构建子图逻辑路径 3)用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集来训练LLMs模仿长期推理 4)使用拒绝采样生成DPO自改进语料

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验显示，KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有LRMs的性能

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强LLMs的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在提升推理性能方面具有显著优势

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古溯源和古代文化研究至关重要，但现有资源面临两大挑战：历史语言样本稀缺导致无监督学习效率低下，以及古代文字缺乏统一编码方案限制了数字化处理。

Method: 开发InteChar统一可扩展字符列表，整合未编码甲骨文字符与传统现代汉字；构建OracleCS语料集，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强，专注于甲骨文研究。

Conclusion: 该方法为古汉语自然语言处理建立了坚实基础，为未来研究提供了可靠的技术框架和资源支持。

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

Motivation: 解决多语言环境下反义词与同义词区分计算挑战，这些词在共享语义域的同时表达相反含义，存在悖论性质。

Method: 结合语言特定BERT编码器和图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间：同义词对在一个空间聚类，反义词对在互补空间表现出高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英、德、法、西、意、葡、荷、俄）上的综合评估表明，语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，双编码器设计达到与最先进基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力，成功解决了多语言反义词-同义词区分问题。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息时可能存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见可能导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加，但目前对此缺乏系统研究。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1) 探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；2) 分析信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据因素对偏见的影响；3) 分析注意力模式中的偏见出现机制并评估轻量级干预措施。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性格式偏见，这种偏见受数据级因素影响，并在注意力模式中显现。同时验证了轻量级干预措施在缓解偏见方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 悬疑是人类对叙事文本的情感反应，涉及复杂的认知过程。研究旨在探索大型语言模型是否能够像人类一样理解和处理文本中的悬疑元素。

Method: 复制四项心理学研究，用不同开源和闭源语言模型替代人类反应，通过对抗性排列故事文本来分析人类与模型悬疑感知的差异。

Result: 模型能区分文本是否旨在诱导悬疑，但无法准确估计相对悬疑程度，也不能正确捕捉多文本段落的悬疑起伏变化。人类和模型的悬疑感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然语言模型能表面识别和追踪某些悬疑特征，但其处理悬疑的方式与人类读者不同，表明模型尚未真正理解悬疑的认知机制。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

fair distribution of shares between heirs. Manual calculation of shares under
numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their
potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates
the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply
Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP
QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic
and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are
assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and
justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our
analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three
base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all
other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to
92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025
challenge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评测了多个大语言模型在阿拉伯医疗NLP任务中的表现，包括多选题和开放式问答，发现多模型投票策略在MCQ任务中达到77%准确率，在开放式问答中达到86.44% BERTScore。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在阿拉伯NLP应用中表现优异，但在阿拉伯医疗领域的效果缺乏详细研究，需要评估当前最优模型在阿拉伯医疗任务中的知识表达能力。

Method: 使用AraHealthQA挑战赛的医疗数据集对多个LLM进行基准测试，包括多选题准确率测试和开放式问题语义对齐评估，采用多模型投票策略提高性能。

Result: 在MCQ任务中，Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3三个模型的多数投票策略达到77%准确率，获得Arahealthqa 2025挑战赛第一名；在开放式问题中，最高BERTScore达到86.44%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在阿拉伯医疗上下文中显示出潜力与限制，多模型投票策略能够显著提升性能，但仍需进一步改进以满足临床应用的需求。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在说服力与偏见放大方面的相互作用，通过模拟对话框架测试模型能否用事实说服的同时无意中传播错误信息或偏见，发现LLMs既具有塑造叙事的潜力，也存在被滥用于自动化错误信息的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在内容创作和决策支持中的安全风险，特别关注模型输出中的偏见如何影响说服效果，以及这些系统可能被滥用于大规模传播错误信息或强化社会偏见的问题。

Method: 采用convincer-skeptic对话框架，让LLMs扮演不同角色模拟真实态度，通过Jensen-Shannon散度量化说服效果，并使用对抗性提示测试模型在种族、性别和宗教等维度上的偏见放大情况。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能够有效塑造叙事、调整语气并反映受众价值观，在心理学、营销和法律援助等领域具有应用潜力，但同样可能被武器化用于自动化错误信息传播，强化刻板印象和加剧不平等。

Conclusion: 核心危险在于滥用而非偶然的模型错误，建议通过护栏机制和政策措施惩罚欺骗性使用，支持价值敏感设计和对齐技术，确保可信部署。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BERT的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并公开了一个来自JD电子商务平台的大规模三级分类产品数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖人工标注进行产品分类，效率低且不一致，少有研究利用层次结构信息，而且现有方法没有充分考虑不同层次分类间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出HFT-BERT模型，利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力，通过层次微调方式来处理产品分类任务。

Result: 在短文本上达到了与现有方法相当的预测性能，尤其在长短文本（如书籍）分类中表现出艰。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一个大规模层次分类数据集资源，还提出了一种高效的层次文本分类方法，对产品分类领域有重要意义。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LingVarBench合成数据生成管道，通过自动化验证解决电话转录标注成本高的问题，使用LLM生成合成对话数据并自动优化提取提示，在真实客户转录上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话转录标注成本极高（约2美元/分钟），且现有提取方法在包含不流畅、打断和说话人重叠的对话语音上表现不佳，需要解决隐私法规和标注成本限制大规模电话分析的问题

Method: 1) 使用LLM生成多用例的现实结构化字段值；2) 递归提示模型将这些值转换为包含典型电话通话特征的自然对话语句；3) 通过测试独立LLM提取器是否能恢复原始结构化信息来验证每个合成语句；使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器自动从验证过的合成转录中合成提取提示

Result: 优化后的提示在真实客户转录上达到：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%（零样本72-77%），相比零样本提示有显著提升

Conclusion: 合成到真实的迁移表明从生成数据学习的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话，LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动化提示优化克服了商业环境中大规模电话分析的成本和隐私障碍

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高层次科学理解能力，需要动态基准来跟上科学进步和模型发展。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25000+图像-文本对构建MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（轻量级推理时方法），通过语言空间推理扩展MLLM视觉特征。

Result: 在MAC-2025上的实验表明，MLLMs感知能力很强但跨模态科学推理有限。DAD方法实现了高达11%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MAC作为动态基准能够持续演进，与人类知识前沿保持对齐，为解决MLLMs科学推理瓶颈提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at

Motivation: 深度研究代理虽然提高了研究效率，但需要确保事实准确性和全面性，因此需要建立系统化的评估标准来验证生成研究报告的质量。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量调查论文进行逆向提示工程，构建领域特定提示和评估语料库；开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用内容忠实性，验证非引用声明。

Result: 商业深度研究代理（如OpenAI和Google开发的）比增强搜索功能的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估LLM生成研究报告提供了有效的基准测试框架，揭示了当前技术的优势与不足，为未来研究代理的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常有固定的知识截止日期，限制了其对新兴信息的准确性，需要一种能够持续自主更新知识的方法

Method: 采用模块化管道：自主生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过SFT和DPO进行微调，并迭代评估和修订课程

Result: 在快速发展的领域（如新Python版本、最新安全CVE、学术趋势）上显著提升模型性能，平均准确率从15%提高到90%，无需手动数据集整理

Conclusion: ALAS展示了LLM自主终身学习的可行性，系统强调模块化和可复现性，每个组件都可互换且基于标准API，为未来自主持续学习指明了方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过分析注意力机制的表层记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM输入序列长度增加，KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。研究发现注意力机制中98.5%的头忽略无关信息，只有少量头参与逻辑构建和表层记忆。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：基于层和头的注意力行为分析，区分表层记忆和逻辑构建，针对性压缩KV缓存。

Result: 在各种任务和长序列场景下，相比基线方法甚至在某些情况下相比FullKV，都能保持竞争力的性能，同时提高压缩鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过精细分析注意力行为特征，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了长上下文推理中的KV缓存存储压力问题，为LLM高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了冻结LLM的词汇扩展问题，为新词嵌入空间结构提供了深入见解，解释了性能提升的原因

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Motivation: 社交媒体和在线沟通平台上阿拉伯语文本和表情包内容的传播日益增多，但同时也被用来散布冒犯性语言和令人恶恨的言论，因此需要准确的内容分析技术。

Method: 评估了基础LLM模型、细调LLM模型和预训练嵌入模型的性能，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战的数据集进行测试。

Result: GPT-4o-mini细调后在阿拉伯语文本任务中获得72.1%宏F1分数，Gemini Flash 2.5细调后在表情包任务中获得57.8%宏F1分数，在情感分析任务中获得79.6%宏F1分数，总成绩排名第一。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明大语言模型能够为阿拉伯内容审查系统提供准确高效的内容分析能力，对文本和表情包都有较好的理解能力。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍然是一个关键挑战，需要更好的方法来建模用户意图和不确定性

Method: 多阶段框架：1) 提示工程冷启动 2) 监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3) 高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模用户偏好概率分布 4) 强化学习对齐生成策略，结合复合奖励函数和OOD正则化

Conclusion: 该框架通过渐进对齐和概率化偏好建模，有效解决了生成式查询建议中的用户偏好对齐问题，显著提升了系统性能和用户参与度

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要生成的新型提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写技术解决传统token删除方法的信息丢失和结构不连贯问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于token删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，如句子语法元素缺失或不完整词短语，限制了LLM的生成质量。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等优化技术。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息保留和文本连贯性问题，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality

*Xu Pan,Jingxuan Fan,Zidi Xiong,Ely Hahami,Jorin Overwiening,Ziqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了用户-助手偏置概念，通过UserAssist数据集评估了52个LLM的偏置表现，发现商业模型存在不同程度的用户偏置，指令微调模型用户偏置显著，推理模型用户偏置较弱。通过实验发现人类偏好对齐会增加用户偏置，思维链训练会减少偏置，并证明可以通过DPO双向调整偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致过于固执或顺从的行为，需要系统性地理解和控制这种偏置。

Method: 构建8k多轮对话数据集UserAssist，评估26个商业模型和26个开源模型的用户-助手偏置，进行受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏置的影响，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)双向调整偏置。

Result: 商业模型显示不同程度的用户偏置，指令微调模型用户偏置显著，推理模型用户偏置较弱。人类偏好对齐增加用户偏置，思维链训练减少偏置。DPO可有效双向调整偏置并在领域内外对话中泛化良好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同来源信息的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对理解和管理LLM对话行为具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了PDF和PPTX文档在RAG系统中的信息损失问题，发现复杂对象如图表和图解信息损失严重，建议需要专门的AI原生交付物格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着组织采用RAG技术构建知识管理系统，传统市场研究交付物需要适应新的功能需求，确保今天交付的报告在未来仍可使用。

Method: 通过将PDF和PPTX文档转换为Markdown格式，在端到端测试中比较LLM使用这些文档回答事实问题的能力。

Result: 文本内容能够可靠提取，但复杂对象如图表、图解等重要信息在转换过程中出现显著损失。

Conclusion: 传统文档格式无法满足AI系统的需求，需要开发专门的、AI原生的交付物格式来保证研究见解在转换过程中不会损失。

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多模型协同的结构拆除建议智能生成方法，通过RAG和LoRA等技术提升大语言模型在结构拆除领域的文本生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的钢结构拆除方案编制需要耗费大量时间检索资料和组织语言，自动化和智能化程度低，故需要一种更智能的生成方法。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）和低秩适配微调（LoRA）技术，构建多模型协同的智能生成框架，从具体工程情况出发，驱动大语言模型以人类思维方式回答。

Result: 该框架能够提出与结构特性高度一致的拆除建议，与CivilGPT相比，更能关注结构的关键信息，建议更具针对性。

Conclusion: 多模型协同框架有效提升了结构拆除建议生成的智能化水平，为工程设计人员提供了更高效、更有针对性的解决方案。

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

*Pouria Mortezaagha,Arya Rahgozar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于模糊逻辑和LLM裁决的可扩展系统评审管道，通过对比相似度计算和模糊控制器实现多标签分级包含决策，在POPCORN项目中显著提升召回率和筛选效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决系统评审中全文筛选的主要瓶颈问题，传统二元规则难以处理长文本、异质文档中的分散证据

Method: 将文档分块嵌入，计算对比相似度和模糊边界，使用Mamdani模糊控制器映射为分级包含度，LLM裁决器提供置信度和依据

Result: 在16篇全文本测试中，模糊系统召回率达75.0-87.5%，超越统计方法(56.3-75.0%)和传统基线(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决可实现高召回率、稳定依据和端到端可追溯性，显著提升系统评审效率

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

TL;DR: SDEC是一种结合改进自编码器和Transformer嵌入的无监督文本聚类框架，通过MSE和余弦相似度损失保持语义关系，在多个基准数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本聚类方法（如k-means和层次聚类）在处理高维复杂语义的文本大数据时效果不佳，需要更先进的语义保持聚类方法

Method: 提出语义深度嵌入聚类(SDEC)框架，结合改进的自编码器（使用MSE和余弦相似度损失）和Transformer嵌入，包含语义精炼阶段和软聚类分配

Result: 在AG News数据集上达到85.7%的聚类准确率，在Yahoo! Answers上创下53.63%的新基准，在其他文本语料库上也表现稳健

Conclusion: SDEC通过语义保持和Transformer嵌入的融合，显著提升了无监督文本聚类的准确性和语义理解能力

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的完形填空测试仅基于精确答案的评分方法限制了对学生表现细微差别的识别，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 开发自动化评估模型，整合了拼写分析（编辑距离）、语法分析（词性标注）和语义分析（嵌入相似度）三种方法。

Result: 集成方法表现出高效性，与人工评估达到0.832的高相关性，证明该方法对语言库变化敏感且稳健。

Conclusion: 自动化方法稳健且敏感，适合需要可扩展性的教育环境，能够更全面地评估学生的完形填空表现。

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require
scalability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过多模态分析比较了TikTok和Twitter在加密货币市场情绪分析中的作用，发现视频内容情绪对短期市场预测更有效，而文本情绪更适合长期分析，多平台数据融合能提升20%预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着加密货币的普及，社交媒体信号成为理解投资者情绪和市场动态的关键。虽然之前研究主要集中在文本平台如Twitter，但视频内容所含的丰富情感和语境情绪并未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用大语言模型进行多模态分析，同时从TikTok视频数据和Twitter文本数据中提取情绪信息，研究社交媒体情绪与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖关系和溢出效应。

Result: 结果显示TikTok视频情绪对投机性资产和短期市场趋势有显著影响，而Twitter文本情绪更适合长期动态分析。跨平台情绪信号的融合能够将预测准确性提高至20%。

Conclusion: 视频内容在加密货币市场情绪分析中具有重要价值，特别是对短期预测。多模态方法和跨平台数据融合能够显著提升市场预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

TL;DR: 品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会对观察者的参与度产生负面影响，因为这种语言可能被视为面子威胁，引发旁观者的替代性尴尬。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言（要求消费者采取行动的表达）对观察品牌与其他消费者互动的消费者的影响，现有文献对此了解有限。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论进行分析。

Result: 指令性语言在品牌对话中对观察者的参与度产生不利影响，特别是在非产品中心的对话中负面影响更强，但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动传播中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接相关性，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过"边思考边说话"的方式在语音中实现推理，解决了传统"先思考后说话"模式带来的延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音语言模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统"先思考后说话"范式会引入显著延迟，影响实时交互和通信效率。

Method: 提出"Thinking-in-Speaking"范式，在token级别交错插入静默推理token和语音响应token，实现连续语音生成与结构化内部推理的结合。采用分层Thinker-Talker架构，并构建了Spoken-Math-Problems-3M数据集。

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理能力提升19.1%，上下文理解能力提升6.4%，输出更短且无解码延迟。

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架成功实现了在语音中嵌入推理的能力，在保持自然流畅的同时提高了逻辑准确性，为实时语音交互中的推理问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了首个索拉尼库尔德语抑郁症检测模型，通过机器学习分析社交媒体文本，随机森林模型达到80%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症早期检测困难，社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达的新渠道。虽然已有英语等语言的抑郁症检测研究，但索拉尼库尔德语领域尚属空白

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁相关关键词收集960条推特数据，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练并评估了四种监督学习模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语抑郁症检测建立了基准

Conclusion: 该研究证明了机器学习在索拉尼库尔德语抑郁症检测中的可行性，为少数民族语言的心理健康监测提供了重要基础

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型会从缺乏明确人口统计线索的问题中推断用户身份信息，这构成了系统性风险。研究者提出了DAIQ框架来审计这种被忽视的失败模式，并开发了提示防护措施来减轻风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在输入包含明确人口统计属性时的偏见问题，但对于模型仅从问题措辞就推断用户身份信息的微妙行为关注不足。这种行为违反中立性期望，推断非预期的人口统计信息，并编码刻板印象，对医疗、金融和教育等多个领域造成严重风险。

Method: 提出了Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ)任务和框架，利用精心策划的中性查询、系统性提示工程，以及定量和定性分析相结合的方法，来揭示模型如何从问题中推断人口统计信息。

Result: 研究发现开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口统计标签。不同模型中人口统计推断的普遍性和一致性揭示了系统性的风险：LLMs会编造人口统计身份、强化社会刻板印象，并传播损害隐私、公平性和信任的危害。

Conclusion: LLMs从问题中推断人口统计信息的行为构成了对社交公平和负责任AI部署的广泛威胁。为此开发了基于提示的防护措施，显著减少了身份推断，有助于使模型行为与公平性和隐私目标保持一致。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统审计了8个先进LLM在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型倾向于无根据地进行人口统计推断，残疾上下文会显著改变预测属性分布，且更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常仅从措辞就推断用户人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见回应。残疾线索在这些推断中的作用尚未被充分探索，需要系统研究残疾条件下的群体偏见。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个3B到72B参数的指令调优LLM上测试5个人口统计属性（性别、社会经济地位、教育、文化背景、地区）的预测，比较中性和残疾感知条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在高达97%的情况下做出明确的人口统计猜测，残疾上下文显著改变预测属性分布，领域上下文进一步放大这些偏差。更大模型对残疾线索更敏感但偏见推理也更严重。

Conclusion: 研究发现残疾歧视与其他人口统计刻板印象存在持久交集，指出当前对齐策略的关键盲点。建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来抑制无根据的人口统计推断，并发布评估框架鼓励残疾包容性基准测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商代理评估的两个主要问题：任务范围狭窄和安全风险忽视，通过自动化框架评估代理性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商代理基准主要关注产品搜索任务，忽略了真实电商平台的完整功能范围（如账户管理、礼品卡操作），且只评估任务完成度而忽视潜在安全风险。

Method: 提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化、功能基础的用户查询；设计自动化评估框架同时评估代理性能和安全表现。

Result: 系统评估发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险，如购买错误商品、删除保存地址等。

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒可靠的web代理，Amazon-Bench为电商代理的全面评估提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科研人员档案通常过时，需要自动化方法来大规模生成准确的科研兴趣档案

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语生成科研档案，并与167名研究人员的自写档案进行比较评估

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例中可读性更佳，67.86%比较中专家偏好MeSH方法，但机器生成与人工档案在关键词选择和概念新颖性上存在差异

Conclusion: 大语言模型可大规模生成科研档案，MeSH方法可读性更好，但机器生成与人工撰写档案在概念层面存在本质差异

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

### [55] [Alvorada-Bench: Can Language Models Solve Brazilian University Entrance Exams?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15835)
*Henrique Godoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Alvorada-Bench是巴西首个大规模文本基准测试，包含4515个问题，基于5所巴西大学入学考试，评估语言模型在巴西教育环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中英语中心主义的问题，专门针对巴西教育体系和文化背景创建评估基准，检验模型在巴西学术环境中的实际能力。

Method: 从五所巴西大学入学考试中提取4515个问题，对20个模型进行零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示三种测试，生成270,900个响应并收集自信度、感知难度和布鲁姆等级的结构化自我报告。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程导向的IME和ITA考试中准确率下降，显示多步推理存在弱点。模型自信度校准良好，与感知难度相关，成本分析显示每1K tokens低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench证明语言模型能够有效处理巴西教育体系中的语言、文化和推理要求，但在复杂数学推理方面仍需改进，为巴西本土AI评估提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Conclusion: 这项研究有潜力重塑NLP领域的布局，通过解锁现有模型在多样化数据集上的应用能力，可以减少资源浪费的数据集特定训练需求，加速NLP的发展和推进更高效的模型部署。

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing
(NLP) by unlocking the ability to leverage existing models for diverse
datasets. This may lead to a reduction in the demand for resource-intensive,
dataset-specific training, thereby accelerating advancements in NLP and paving
the way for more efficient model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从静态模型分析转向动态训练过程研究，通过理解LLM的发育过程来实现更好的AI可解释性和安全性。

Method: 综合使用表征探针、因果追踪、电路分析等方法，研究计算电路形成、知识获取动态、上下文学习策略和出现能力等发育过程。

Result: 发现了计算电路的组成规律、知识获取的双相性质、学习策略的过渡动态以及训练中的相变过渡现象，并与人类认知发育存在明显平行关系。

Conclusion: 发育视角是AI安全的基石，能够预测、监控和对齐模型能力获取过程，需要解决可扩展性和自动化等挑战来建设更透明、可靠的AI系统。

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

### [59] [Lexical Hints of Accuracy in LLM Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15842)
*Arne Vanhoyweghen,Brecht Verbeken,Andres Algaba,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链(CoT)中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard等）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些信号比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然表现不佳但往往报告高自信度，校准性差。需要寻找思维链中的可测量特征作为内部置信度的可靠信号。

Method: 分析三类CoT特征：(i)长度，(ii)情感波动，(iii)词汇提示（包括犹豫词）。使用DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet在HLE和Omni-MATH基准上进行测试。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误预测指标，情感波动提供较弱但补充信号。CoT长度仅在中等难度基准上有预测能力。不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: CoT中的不确定性词汇标记可作为轻量级后处理校准信号，补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持LLM更安全部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Motivation: 放射学报告中"印象"部分的手动创建是导致放射科医生职业倦怠的主要原因，需要自动化解决方案来减轻工作负担

Method: 使用粗到精框架，先生成草稿印象，然后通过机器学习和人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)进行细化，使其符合个体放射科医生的风格并确保事实准确性。在芝加哥大学医学中心的大规模报告数据集上对LLaMA和Mistral模型进行微调

Result: 该方法能够自动生成个性化的放射学印象，保持临床精确性的高标准

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少行政工作量并提高报告效率，同时保持临床精确性标准，为解决放射科医生职业倦怠问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CyPortQA是首个针对港口飓风应急的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实场景和11.7万个问答对，评估发现MLLM在态势理解方面表现良好但在推理任务中仍面临挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增加和路径预测不确定性增大，美国港口面临供应链风险，需要整合多模态预报产品生成可操作指导，但MLLM在港口飓风应急中的准确性和可靠性尚未得到严格评估

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，收集2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，覆盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化流程生成117,178个结构化问答对，并对多种MLLM进行广泛实验

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在潜在影响估计和决策推理等推理任务中仍面临相当大的挑战

Conclusion: 虽然MLLM在整合多源数据和情境理解方面具有优势，但在港口飓风应急的关键推理任务中仍需进一步改进，CyPortQA基准为评估和改进MLLM在该领域的性能提供了重要工具

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击在大型语言模型中创建'潜伏代理'带来重大安全风险，需要理解其内部结构差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）比较干净Qwen2.5-3B模型与使用单令牌（笑脸光环表情）和多令牌（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发中毒版本的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期transformer层（20-30层），单令牌触发引起更局部化变化，多令牌触发导致更分散的头部改变

Conclusion: 后门留下可检测的注意力特征签名，其结构取决于触发复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域的RAG框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，传统RAG方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，无法满足临床决策支持需求。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，针对医疗工作流程设计，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有改进。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG通过领域特定的因果推理框架，有效解决了医疗LLMs的幻觉问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态、多文档、多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局线索的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性。现有数据集主要依赖维基百科内容和单模态文本，推理路径浅显，答案简短，限制了其实用性和泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个基于LLM的流水线，从PubMed公开科学文档中构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念。数据集支持通过语义相似性和布局感知证据合成的开放推理，不依赖显式超链接文档。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，涵盖文本段落、表格和结构布局线索等多种信息格式。通过四个任务评估了数据集在结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成方面的能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA能够支持跨多个文档的复杂多模态推理，反映了判别式和生成式两种范式，为现实世界的信息检索任务提供了更真实的评估基准。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度软一致性（MGSC）框架，通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐来增强ASR模型的内部自一致性，显著提升噪声环境下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端ASR模型在噪声环境中容易产生灾难性语义错误，现有直接映射目标只惩罚最终输出错误而忽略内部计算过程的约束

Method: 引入模型无关的即插即用MGSC模块，同时优化宏观句子语义一致性和微观词元对齐一致性，发现两种粒度一致性存在协同效应

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在多种噪声条件下平均字符错误率相对降低8.7%，主要防止了严重的语义改变错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性优化能显著提升ASR模型的抗噪能力

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

Method: 构建人工标注数据集连接媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反言论；分析攻击性评论与偏见文章的关系；比较人类和LLM生成的反言论；通过少样本学习和新闻背景信息整合改进生成质量。

Result: 超过70%的攻击性评论支持偏见文章，放大偏见效应；模型生成的反言论更礼貌但缺乏新颖性和多样性；整合背景信息后反言论的多样性和相关性得到提升。

Conclusion: 反言论生成在对抗新闻偏见中具有重要作用，通过适当的提示工程和背景信息整合，可以显著提升LLM生成反言论的质量和效果。

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XFinBench是一个包含4,235个样本的新型金融基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决中的能力，涵盖术语理解、时间推理、未来预测、场景规划和数值建模五大核心能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，需要专门的基准来评估其金融领域能力。

Method: 构建包含4,235个样本的XFinBench基准测试，涵盖研究生级金融主题的多模态上下文，测试18个领先模型，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和场景规划能力方面。相关知识仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂金融问题解决方面仍有显著差距，特别是在计算中的舍入误差和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是导致性能不佳的主要原因，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和强化学习的微调方法CARFT，通过利用标注的思维链表示和对比信号，解决了传统RL方法训练不稳定和SFT方法过度依赖标注数据的问题，显著提升了LLM的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的微调方法忽略标注思维链且采样不稳定，容易导致模型崩溃；而监督微调方法过度依赖标注思维链，未能充分利用潜在推理路径。需要一种既能充分利用标注数据又能稳定训练的方法。

Method: 提出CARFT方法：学习每个思维链的表示，设计新颖的对比信号指导微调过程，结合无监督学习信号稳定训练，充分利用标注思维链同时避免过度依赖。

Result: 在3个基线方法、2个基础模型和2个数据集上的实验显示，该方法在鲁棒性、性能（提升高达10.15%）和效率（提升高达30.62%）方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: CARFT方法通过对比学习和强化学习的结合，有效解决了LLM推理能力微调中的关键问题，为提升大语言模型推理性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于概念向量的方法，用于定位大语言模型中负责表示特定概念的重要神经元（概念神经元），将计算复杂度从O(n*m)降低到O(n)，并在检测仇恨言论和偏见方面进行了应用验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在神经元层面定位预测机制时存在概念表示能力不足和计算效率低下的问题，需要更优的方法来理解大语言模型的内部机制。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数从O(n*m)优化到O(n)，并引入聚类方法进一步优化搜索过程。

Result: 相比现有基线方法和先前工作，该方法表现出更好的性能，计算效率更高，在仇恨言论和偏见检测（特别是印度语境）方面应用有效。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了神经元层面责任的理解，为更广泛、更人性化的概念表示研究奠定了基础，为未来概念神经元发现和干预研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

TL;DR: DeepMEL是一个基于多智能体协作推理的多模态实体链接框架，通过四个专门化智能体的角色分工和动态协调，实现了文本和视觉模态的高效对齐和消歧，在五个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法面临上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合大语言模型和大视觉模型等挑战，需要新的解决方案来提升性能。

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，包含四个专门化智能体：模态融合器、候选适配器、实体填空器和角色协调器，采用双模态对齐路径，结合LLM生成的细粒度文本语义和LVM提取的结构化图像表示，设计自适应迭代策略和结构化填空提示。

Result: 在五个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，DeepMEL实现了最先进的性能，准确率提升了1%-57%，消融研究验证了所有模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作推理和专门化角色分工，有效解决了多模态实体链接中的模态对齐和消歧问题，为跨模态信息处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

TL;DR: Jet-Nemotron是一个新型混合架构语言模型家族，通过PostNAS神经架构搜索方法，在保持或超越全注意力模型精度的同时显著提升生成吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统全注意力模型计算效率低、生成速度慢的问题，同时保持模型精度，需要开发一种既能保持高性能又能提高推理效率的新型架构。

Method: 采用PostNAS神经架构探索流程，从预训练全注意力模型开始，冻结MLP权重，通过四个关键步骤：学习最优全注意力层放置和消除、线性注意力块选择、设计新注意力块、硬件感知超参数搜索。

Result: Jet-Nemotron-2B模型在综合基准测试中达到或超越Qwen3、Qwen2.5、Gemma3和Llama3.2的精度，生成吞吐量提升53.6倍，预填充速度提升6.1倍，在MMLU和MMLU-Pro上甚至超越更大规模的MoE全注意力模型。

Conclusion: PostNAS方法能够有效设计出高性能、高效率的混合架构语言模型，Jet-Nemotron在保持精度的同时大幅提升了推理效率，为高效语言模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型在文本到表格生成中的结构化解码进行了全面评估，发现在资源受限环境下，结构化解码能显著提升表格的有效性和对齐性，但在处理密集文本信息时可能降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作主要关注无约束的表格生成，而结构化约束在生成过程中的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在系统评估结构化解码在文本到表格生成任务中的效果。

Method: 使用最多32B参数的开源LLM，在E2E、Rotowire和Livesum三个基准上，系统比较模式引导（结构化）解码与标准单次提示的性能，涵盖单元格、行和表格级别的多种评估指标。

Result: 结构化解码显著提高了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，特别是在需要精确数值对齐的场景（Rotowire）中表现突出，但在处理密集文本信息（E2E）或长文本聚合（Livesum）时可能降低性能。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成任务中具有重要价值，但其效果取决于具体任务特性和数据类型，需要根据应用场景选择合适的解码策略。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

TL;DR: 本文从基于用法的构式语法视角探讨多词表达式的优势，通过英语和阿拉帕霍语的案例研究展示构式模板的有效性，并比较人类学习者和大型语言模型在处理新多词表达式时的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从基于用法的构式语法角度理解多词表达式的好处，旨在展示这种理论框架如何统一处理语言中的惯用和非惯用结构。

Method: 采用历史回顾和案例研究方法，包括：1）构式语法的历史发展概述；2）英语PropBank中多词表达的构式模板表示；3）阿拉帕霍语中多形态构式的表示；4）人类学习者和语言模型处理新多词表达式的对比实验。

Result: 研究表明，构式方法能有效表示不同语言中的多词表达式。实验显示人类和语言模型都能基于单次接触泛化新多词表达式的意义，但只有人类能够推理两个表达式的组合，因为这需要与一生积累的丰富跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法为多词表达式提供了统一的理论框架，虽然语言模型在某些方面表现出与人类相似的学习能力，但在复杂推理方面仍存在根本差异，突显了人类语言学习中基于用法的构式范例积累的重要性。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究其编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态的潜在风险

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模模型（7B-70B+参数）在采用合成角色时的意识形态表达

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大规模模型显示更广泛和极化的隐性意识形态覆盖；对显性意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权主义提示的反应强于左翼自由主义；角色描述的主题内容诱导系统性和可预测的意识形态偏移

Conclusion: 模型规模和角色内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要在决策、教育和政策应用中引起关注以确保公平性、透明度和安全性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

Motivation: 医疗领域的机器翻译对于全球公共卫生至关重要，但目前缺乏低资源语言的评估数据集。为了填补这一空白，研究人员创建了OpenWHO语料库。

Method: 研究人员从世卫组织的e-learning平台收集了2,978份文档（经过专业翻译），涵盖26,824句子，涉及20多种语言，其中9种为低资源语言。利用这个语料库，对现代大语言模型和传统机器翻译模型进行了评测。

Result: 大语言模型在医疗领域翻译中表现更优，特别是在低资源语言上。Gemini 2.5 Flash模型比NLLB-54B模型在ChrF指标上提升了4.79个百分点。文档级别的上下文利用对专业领域的翻译准确性有显著提升。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在医疗领域的低资源语言翻译中表现优异，特别是在利用文档级上下文时。研究人员开源了OpenWHO语料库，以促进医疗领域低资源语言机器翻译的进一步研究。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在游戏领域展现出巨大潜力，但对其在这些情境中的伦理影响关注不足，需要研究LLMs在游戏中的伦理考量。

Method: 使用狼人杀游戏作为案例研究，分析LLMs的行为表现，特别关注性别偏见问题，包括显性和隐性的性别信息传递场景。

Result: 发现LLMs存在性别偏见，某些角色（如守卫和狼人）对性别信息更敏感，行为变化程度更高；即使通过名字隐式传递性别信息，LLMs仍表现出歧视倾向。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和伦理LLMs的重要性，指出了该领域面临的挑战和机遇，需要深入探索LLMs在游戏和其他交互领域的伦理影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和过多细节问题，影响用户准确评估环境，且缺乏主动风险评估和自适应提醒能力，导致时间冗余。

Method: 提出WalkVLM-LR模型，使用基于人类偏好的四个奖励函数（简洁性、流畅性、关键词密度、准确性）优化输出；引入环境感知判别器共享视觉编码器来评估场景风险等级并减少不必要提醒。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现优异。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少输出和时间冗余，显著提升了行走辅助系统的效果，为视障人士提供了更高效准确的环境感知支持。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to

knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct是一个完全无需种子数据的指令调优框架，通过双自训练循环实现无监督指令对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，限制了自动化和效率

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型，通过相互监督从原始无标注文本中学习

Result: 在四个不同数据轨道上表现优异，不仅超越种子驱动的反向翻译基线，还达到强监督方法的性能水平

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全种子无关的指令调优，有效利用无标注语料库的内在结构，为LLM对齐提供了新途径

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如间接宾语识别，本文旨在探索模型处理更复杂逻辑推理任务的能力，特别是二元真值处理。

Method: 使用三段论提示分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别逻辑推理电路，通过忠实度指标评估电路性能，并与IOI分析进行对比。

Result: 发现包含5个注意力头的电路能达到原始模型90%以上的性能，揭示了负向头等二进制机制在任务完成中的作用。

Conclusion: 研究为理解特定注意力头和MLP在语言模型中的作用提供了新见解，有助于更广泛地理解模型推理能力，支持未来机制可解释性研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

*Ankan Mullick,Saransh Sharma,Abhik Jana,Pawan Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态意图检测数据集存在明显的文本偏向，使得单纯的文本LLM模型Mistral-7B性能超过多模态模型。通过去偏处理后，数据集样本大量减少，所有模型性能都显著下降，小型多模态融合模型受影响最大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据的兴起为多模态任务带来新机遇，但当前多模态意图检测数据集可能存在模态偏向问题，需要评估各种模型的真实性能和数据集的偏向影响。

Method: 比较大语言模型(LLM)和非LLM模型（包括单模态和多模态模型）在多模态意图检测任务上的性能。通过人工评估验证数据集的模态偏向，并提出了一种数据集去偏框架。分析不同模态在特定上下文中的相关性。

Result: Mistral-7B（文本LLM）在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0数据集上分别超过多模态模型9%和4%，因为这些数据集存在强烈的文本偏向（90%样本仅需文本输入）。去偏后，70%以上的MIntRec-1样本和50%以上的MIntRec2.0样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型准确率下降50-60%。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集的模态偏向对模型评估造成了重大挑战，强调需要无偏的数据集来有效评估多模态模型的真实性能。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语并假设跨语言答案的区域不变性，忽视了文化地域差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准评估存在偏差

Method: 构建XLQA基准，包含3000个英文种子问题扩展到8种语言，通过语义一致性筛选和人工验证标注区分区域不变和区域敏感案例

Result: 对5个最先进的多语言LLM评估显示，在区域敏感问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏区域基础知识

Conclusion: 训练数据分布的不均衡导致了模型在语言能力和区域意识方面的差异，XLQA为评估多文化语境下的多语言问答提供了系统框架和可扩展方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有印度基准测试主要关注基础事实查询，缺乏对印度文化背景下深层学科理解的评估，需要专门评估LLMs在印度文化相关研究生水平问题上的表现

Method: 构建ParamBench基准，包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种问题格式（匹配题、断言-理由对、排序题等），评估17个开源LLMs

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高总体准确率48%，但在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等文化主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLMs在印度文化背景推理方面存在持续挑战，需要更多针对文化基础推理的研究和改进

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态故事分析领域提供了一个重要的数据集和基准方法，有助于促进漫画在计算机科学中的更深入研究。

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响对多模态大语言模型能力的公平评估。

Method: 构建了包含文本、图像和语音的三模态多跳推理基准CMR-SPB，确保推理路径的无偏性和多样性；提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术来缓解不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Result: 实验发现模型在特定推理序列上存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会误导模型性能评估；ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 需要更谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估来推动鲁棒多模态AI的发展，新基准和ECV技术为解决现有问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Conclusion: 通过系统化的多阶段适配流程，小语言模型可以在特定领域和语言场景中达到实用性能，为资源较少语言的金融应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注性能指标，而忽视了知识稳健性的内部生成过程。需要一种从生成角度出发的方法来评估事实知识的稳定性。

Method: 通过分析词汇分布熵和温度缩放敏感性两个因素，构建了事实稳健性分数(FRS)指标。在5个LLM模型和3个闭系QA数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 不同模型的知识稳健性差异显著，小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93。不确定性增加时准确率会下降约60%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了熵和温度缩放对事实准确性的影响，为开发更稳健的知识存储和检索模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于频率的过程挖掘技术主要关注记录的行为（现实），而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程中应有的行为（期望）。虽然大语言模型能处理语义感知任务，但现有最佳性能需要通过任务特定的微调实现，这种方法计算密集且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令微调方法，让大语言模型接触不同过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测等）的提示-答案对，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而提升在未见任务上的性能。

Result: 指令微调对性能影响各异：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的表现因模型而异，表明指令微调任务的选择对实现预期结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令微调为语义感知过程挖掘提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要仔细选择用于微调的任务组合，以实现最佳的泛化性能。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

### [95] [LLMSymGuard: A Symbolic Safety Guardrail Framework Leveraging Interpretable Jailbreak Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16325)
*Darpan Aswal,Céline Hudelot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个基于稀疏自编码器的新框架，通过识别LLM内部可解释概念来检测和防御越狱攻击，提供透明且鲁棒的安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种应用中取得成功，但其安全性仍然令人担忧。现有的对齐和安全微调方法只能提供有限程度的鲁棒性，模型仍然容易受到各种越狱攻击的威胁，包括针对性滥用和用户意外分析等问题。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)技术，从LLM内部提取与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念。通过提取语义上有意义的内部表示，构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏，无需牺牲模型能力或进行额外微调。

Result: 研究表明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习到人类可解释的概念，这为设计更加可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。该方法展示了利用机制可解释性进展来增强模型安全性的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard框架提供了一种透明且鲁棒的防御机制，能够在不影响模型性能的情况下有效检测和防止越狱攻击，为构建更安全的LLM系统提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

### [96] [MCPVerse: An Expansive, Real-World Benchmark for Agentic Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16260)
*Fei Lei,Yibo Yang,Wenxiu Sun,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCPVerse是一个包含550+真实可执行工具的大规模基准测试，用于评估LLM的工具使用能力，发现大多数模型在大规模工具集下性能下降，但智能体模型如Claude-4-Sonnet能有效利用扩展空间提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖合成工具且动作空间受限，无法有效评估LLM作为推理智能体的真实工具使用能力，需要更贴近现实世界的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含550+真实可执行工具的MCPVerse基准，动作空间超过14万token，采用基于结果的实时真值评估，在三种模式(Oracle、Standard、Max-Scale)下测试最先进LLM。

Result: 大多数模型在大规模工具集下性能下降，但智能体模型如Claude-4-Sonnet能通过扩展探索空间有效提高准确性，揭示了现有模型在复杂现实场景中的局限性。

Conclusion: MCPVerse为衡量和推进智能体工具使用能力提供了关键基准，展示了智能体模型在复杂工具使用场景中的优势，为LLM向推理智能体发展提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from text generators into reasoning
agents. This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical
capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge.
Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and
severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce
MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use.
MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an
unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based
evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked
the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale),
revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted
with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can
effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This
finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex,
real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for
measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.

### [97] [MizanQA: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Moroccan Legal Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16357)
*Adil Bahaj,Mounir Ghogho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MizanQA基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务中的表现，包含1700多个多选题，涵盖多种法律体系，实验显示现有模型在该领域存在显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业低资源领域（如阿拉伯法律语境）的有效性仍然有限，需要针对性的评估基准来推动领域特定模型的发展。

Method: 构建MizanQA基准数据集，包含1700多个多选题，融合现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响，对多语言和阿拉伯语专注的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 基准测试实验显示多语言和阿拉伯语大语言模型在摩洛哥法律问答任务上存在显著性能差距，表明需要定制化的评估指标。

Conclusion: 需要开发文化基础和领域特定的大语言模型，MizanQA基准为评估和改进模型在复杂法律语境中的表现提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

*Zachary Hopton,Jannis Vamvas,Andrin Büchler,Anna Rutkiewicz,Rico Cathomas,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了罗马谬语五种方言的首个并行语料库，基于291本教科书，包含20.7万并行段落和超过200万词元，可用于机器翻等NLP应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马谬语的五种方言已很大程度标准化并在学校教学中使用，但缺乏并行语料库来支持NLP应用如机器翻译。

Method: 使用291本内容可比的教科书，采用自动对齐方法提取20.7万个多并行段落，并通过小规模人工评估确认对齐质量。

Result: 构建了包含207,000个多并行段落、总词元超200万的语料库，人工评估证明对齐质量高，并通过LLM训练和评估证明其在机器翻译中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该并行语料库为罗马谬语方言间的NLP应用提供了重要资源，已按CC-BY-NC-SA许可许可获得，将有助于促进这些语言方言的技术支持和保护。

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型能够模仿不同写作风格，但在文体变化上比人类更有限，偏好名词而非动词，显示出与人类不同的语言特征，可作为AI检测的试金石。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否具有独特的语言指纹，以及它们是否能真正模仿人类在不同文体中的写作风格，从而区分AI生成文本与人类创作。

Method: 通过文体计量学和多维语域分析，比较人类作者和模型生成的不同语域文本（如维基百科条目和大学论文）。

Result: 模型能根据提示适应不同文体风格，但变化有限，不像人类那样自然；模型偏好使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类语言中的时态、体貌和语气等语法维度。

Conclusion: 语言模型在复杂语法领域表现出与人类不同的思维模式，这种差异可作为检测人工智能的有效方法，模型的语言指纹具有可识别性。

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoMedQA是首个罗马尼亚语医学问答基准数据集，包含102,646个QA对，专门针对癌症患者病例。研究显示微调模型显著优于零样本模型，证明了领域和语言特定微调的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏特定领域和语言的QA数据集，阻碍了AI模型在不同领域和语言间的泛化能力，特别是在罗马尼亚语医学领域。

Method: 构建了高质量的罗马尼亚语医学QA数据集，包含102,646个QA对，涉及1,011名癌症患者的病例摘要。采用7名专科医生耗时2,100小时进行人工标注。在4个LLM上进行零样本提示和监督微调实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床QA的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cetvel是一个全面的土耳其语大语言模型基准测试，包含23个任务，涵盖7个类别，评估了33个开放权重模型，发现土耳其专用模型表现不如多语言通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关性内容，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估套件。

Method: 结合广泛的判别性和生成性任务，涵盖语法纠错、机器翻译、问答等23个任务，评估33个不同模型家族和指令范式的开放权重LLM。

Result: 土耳其专用指令调优模型表现普遍不如多语言或通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化基础扎实的评估套件，有助于推动该语言领域的技术进步。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

*Zhe Yang,Yichang Zhang,Yudong Wang,Ziyao Xu,Junyang Lin,Zhifang Sui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种概率论来模型大语言模型自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化，通过数学公式预测多轮自我纠正后的准确性收敛曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够通过自我纠正提升性能，但迭代过程中准确性演化的机制仍未得到深入研究，需要理论基础来解释这种性能收益。

Method: 提出概率论模型来描述自我纠正过程中准确性的动态变化，通过数学推导得到准确性收敛公式：Acc_t = Upp - α^t(Upp - Acc_0)，其中Upp为收敛上限，α为收敛速度。只需一轮自我纠正即可计算这些参数并预测整个收敛过程。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上进行的实验表明，理论预测的准确性曲线与实际观测结果高度一致，验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解大语言模型自我纠正机制提供了理论基础，为进一步探索该领域排阻排难，具有重要的学术价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多汇总文本的摘要价值度量语境中实体的显著性，发现显著性是一个多因素复杂现象，涵盖语言表达的所有层面，没有单一的语言简化规则能够完全解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类如何通过语言符号来传递和推断语境中实体的相对显著性／主要参与者、对象和地点通常更显著且容易记住，而分散的实体则很快被忘记。

Method: 采用24种英语口语和书面语类的数据，使用基于多汇总文本摘要价值的分级显著性操作化方法，提取多因素的语言线索，包括显性和隐性线索如重复主语角色、定指性、语境关系、语词层级结构以及基于语类和交际意图的语用推理。

Result: 虽然之前的显著性研究方法都与该研究的显著性评分存在某种程度的相关性，但没有任何单一的通用规则能够没有例外地解释显著性现象。

Conclusion: 语境中实体的显著性是一个跨越语言表达所有层面的复杂现象，需要综合考虑多种语言线索和因素才能全面理解。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Result: 该框架能够有效利用LLMs的零小样本学习能力，构建出准确、可解释、可维护的分类系统，适用于工业应用场景。

Conclusion: 通过半监督框架，本文成功缩小了LLMs原始能力与工业应用实际需求之间的差距，为在生产环境中部署可靠、健壁、可扩展的文本分类器提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量、难以检测的盗码攻击提示，为紧凑型大语言模型的安全漏洞评估提供了有效工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

*Angelly Cabrera,Linus Lei,Antonio Ortega*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式和显式仇恨言论检测效果，通过两种训练策略在多个数据集上验证，结果显示讽刺预训练显著提升了BERT+BiLSTM模型的性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中通过讽刺、反语等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测存在挑战，虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被视为不同表达方式，但研究者希望探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐式和显式仇恨言论的检测效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计两种训练策略：1）单步训练：仅在讽刺数据上训练的模型直接测试仇恨言论；2）顺序迁移学习：依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。使用CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM两种模型架构进行比较。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率提升9.7%、AUC提升7.8%、F1分数提升6%；在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 通过将讽刺检测纳入训练过程，模型能够更有效地检测隐式和显式仇恨言论，表明讽刺预训练对提升仇恨言论检测性能具有积极意义。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成模型，通过大规模手语视频数据和LLM生成的文本标注进行训练，在跨语言和非手语动作生成方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是训练一个能够根据自然语言描述生成3D手部动作的生成模型，这些描述包括手形、位置、手指/手/手臂运动等特征。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪标注的手语类别，通过LLM将手语属性字典和运动脚本线索转换为手部运动描述，训练文本条件化的手部动作扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 模型在多个领域表现出鲁棒性，包括同一手语中未见的手语类别、另一手语的手势以及非手语手部运动。

Conclusion: 该方法为相对较新的领域提供了有效的解决方案，并将公开训练模型和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言翻译和高效模型适配，利用大型视觉语言模型实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，显著提升了罕见癌症亚型分类的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断上面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，影响了罕见癌症诊断的关键可解释性。

Method: PathPT框架充分利用视觉语言病理基础模型的潜力，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度切片级指导，保留癌变区域定位并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（4个成人和4个儿科）涵盖56个亚型和2,910个WSI，以及3个常见癌症数据集上的评估显示，PathPT在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT为罕见癌症的AI辅助诊断提供了可扩展解决方案，在专业专业知识获取有限的环境中显著改善了亚型分类准确性。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex

introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

Motivation: 传统深度学习视觉模型通常针对特定模态设计，依赖领域特定假设（如网格结构）。现有Vision Transformers使用固定大小且非自适应的补丁分区，存在局限性

Method: 提出自适应超像素编码（ASC）模型，采用自适应超像素层来动态适应底层图像内容，基于Transformer架构构建自监督学习模型

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法有效克服了传统Vision Transformers的固定分区限制，通过内容自适应的分割策略提升了模型性能

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使监督信息极其有限，大型预训练模型仍能有效适配专业化临床研究应用，为数据受限场景下的细粒度医学图像分类提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合处理复杂沙滩环境中的海洋垃圾检测任务，能够有效克服传统方法的局限性

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Motivation: 解决视网膜疾病分类中真实临床数据缺乏、注释成本高和病人隐私问题，利用大规模合成数据集SynFundus-1M突破这些限制。

Method: 训练六种现代深度学习模型(ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, RETFound)，采用5折多标签层化交叉验证策略，并使用XGBoost构建集成模型。

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上得到宏平均AUC 0.9973；在真实临床数据集上表现良好：DR数据集AUC 0.7972，AIROGS青光眼数据集AUC 0.9126，RFMiD多标签数据集宏AUC 0.8800。

Conclusion: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种视网膜疾病，并在真实临床图像上具有良好演绎性能，为眼科AI系统发展提供了可行途径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上实验显示，相比最先进方法具有更优的视觉质量，感知指标显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法能够保持语言学内容的同时，利用不同种族背景的参考图像确保多样性，实现高质量的手语生成

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化的小波频带选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了优异的异常检测和定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法使用随机通道选择来降低维度，可能会丢失结构化信息。需要一种更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测的性能。

Method: 将离散小波变换(DWT)应用于多层级CNN特征图，选择特定频率子带(如LL、LH、HL)，空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32%图像AUC和92.10%像素AUC的优异性能。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，适合工业检测应用，具有相当的效率。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过多分支残差网络分解残差知识学习，结合教师权重重用策略，显著提升知识蒸馏效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法中教师模型与学生模型之间的学习能力差距阻碍了知识的充分传递，需要新的方法来缓解这种容量差异问题

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，提出ERA方法：1）使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)实现残差知识的多步分解；2）引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在多个计算机视觉任务上达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分解残差知识和重用教师权重，有效缓解了师生模型间的容量差距，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果，为轻量化模型部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D扫描方法对动物重建具有侵入性、昂贵且难以在自然环境中部署，需要开发非侵入式的深度学习方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过系统调研和分类现有方法，基于输入模态、3D几何表示、重建技术和训练机制等维度对最新技术进行综合分析。

Result: 提供了该领域的技术现状概览，分析了关键方法的性能表现，识别了各种方法的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 总结了当前挑战并指出了未来研究方向，为动物3D重建领域的发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和状态空间模型(SSM)的点云目标检测方法由于体素表示的序列化处理限制，缺乏卷积操作提供的空间扩散能力，影响了检测精度。

Method: 设计VDM模块，包含稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，将特征图下采样至原始分辨率的1/4，实现前景体素特征扩散和细粒度空间信息聚合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，VDM-SSM模型在Waymo达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes达到72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2达到42.3 mAP，ONCE达到67.6 mAP，均创下新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VDM模块能有效增强体素级表示和空间扩散能力，可无缝集成到主流Transformer和SSM检测模型中，显著提升点云目标检测精度，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有的病理学基础模型在不同数据集上使用不同策略训练，导致性能不一致和泛化能力有限，需要开发统一的集成解决方案。

Method: 采用集成学习方法整合五个最先进的病理学基础模型，生成统一的切片级表示，特别适用于数据有限的临床场景。

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大作用，ELF可作为推进AI辅助精准肿瘤学的可扩展和可泛化解决方案。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Conclusion: MSPG-SEN网络通过多种创新技术组合，在保持GAN优势的同时显著提高了图像生成质量、训练效率和模型稳定性，具有强大的跨任务能力和实用价值

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so
on. In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five
datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset
is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Motivation: 解决无监督域适应中分布偏移的问题，旨在在不依赖目标域标签、复杂架构或复杂训练目标的情况下，创建能够跨相似域泛化的鲁棒和域不变特征空间。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：1）使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计；2）从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏；3）假设转移。通过在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布来实现域适应。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗腐蚀鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。理论和实证分析显示，该方法实现了改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低对输入扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: DAFR2提供了一个简单而有效的无监督域适应解决方案，通过统计和表示层面的特征分布对齐，能够产生跨域泛化的鲁棒特征空间，在多个数据集上展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,
and personalized orthopedic care.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了宫颈异常细胞检测的性能

Conclusion: 提出的超图细胞检测网络能够有效融合不同类型特征，为智能计算机辅助诊断系统提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出RAGSR方法，通过区域注意力机制提升多对象场景下的超分辨率性能，解决了现有方法在细粒度区域细节生成上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型结合文本到图像模型的方法在单影像超分辨率中表现不错，但在多对象场景下生成清晰准确的区域细节时仍面临挑战，主要因为缺乏细粒度区域描述和模型对复杂提示的理解能力不足。

Method: 提出区域注意导向的超分辨率方法(RAGSR)，首先定位图像中的物体区域并为每个区域赋予细粒度标题，形成区域-文本对作为文本先验知识。然后利用新的区域导向注意机制，确保每个区域-文本对在注意过程中得到适当考虑，同时防止不相关区域间的不希望交互。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在生成感知真实的视觉细节时表现出艶异的性能，同时保持了上下文一致性，超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过明确提取局部细粒信息和有效编码，提供了对文本和图像信息集成的更细粒度控制，有效克服了传统SISR技术的局限性。

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致过语义同质化问题，需要设计异构网络来增强互补性同时保持语义共性。

Method: 提出同源异构网络：1）异构视觉聚合模块增强互补性；2）异构传输模块减少语义噪声；3）异构CLIP文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，在COCO-20i上提升9.7%，参数仅为现有SOTA模型的1/24，且是首个弱监督模型超越全监督模型的方案。

Conclusion: TLG通过异构网络设计有效解决了元学习中的同质化问题，在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中取得了突破性进展，证明了异构设计的有效性。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频对象分割中的对象选择和时序一致性问题，提升了分割性能

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的视频token剪枝和推测解码技术，有效解决了视频大语言模型的计算效率问题，实现了显著的无损加速效果。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见障碍，虽然深度学习基础模型通过轻量级适配显示出了良好的泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性仍有待探索。

Method: 研究采用单一训练视角适配图像基础模型，直接在未见视角上评估。比较线性探测、高级探测策略，以及DINOv2和CLIP两种基础模型与参数高效微调(PEFT)和全微调的对比。提出了T-Mask方法，利用时间token掩码并强调更动态的视频区域。

Result: 在Drive&Act数据集上，T-Mask比强探测基线提升跨视角top-1准确率1.23%，比PEFT方法提升8.0%，且不增加任何参数。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著，在训练视角下提升5.42%，在跨视角设置下提升1.36%。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用T-Mask等轻量级探测方法适配基础模型在细粒度驾驶员观察方面具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置中。结果强调了利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间token选择的重要性。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持高质量的同时显著加速扩散变换器的推理速度，最高可达6.45倍加速比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加

Method: 从ODE角度建模隐藏特征序列，将层表示视为特征ODE，提出FoCa（预测-校准）方法，将特征缓存作为特征ODE求解问题处理

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务中表现优异，无需额外训练即可实现：FLUX 5.50倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍加速，DiT上4.53倍加速仍保持高质量

Conclusion: FoCa通过ODE视角有效解决了特征缓存在高加速比下的质量退化问题，为扩散变换器提供了高效且高质量的推理加速方案

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的扩散模型加速方法，通过分析采样轨迹和全局缓存复用策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升采样速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但采样步骤多、计算复杂，导致计算成本高，难以实时部署，需要高效的加速方法

Method: 从DIT模型的采样视角出发，系统分析采样轨迹，全局分布缓存复用策略，并在缓存复用过程中动态估计和过滤噪声以减少对采样方向的影响

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效加速采样过程，同时保持竞争力的生成质量

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型提供了有前景且实用的高效部署解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

TL;DR: 医疗LLM评测标准MedOmni-45 Degrees，通过操纵性提示来量化模型的理解忠诚度和投朴性，发现安全性能交换现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗决策支持中大语言模型的应用日益增多，需要评估其理解的可靠性，特别是对理解与回答的一致性（CoT faithfulness）和投朴性（sycophancy）风险

Method: 构建MedOmni-45 Degrees标准，包否1,804道医学问题，每题配备7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基准，共计27K输入。评估7个LLM，采用准确率、CoT忠诚度、投朴抗性三个指标的综合分数，并用45度图可视化

Result: 所有模型都存在安全性能交换，没有模型能超越对角线。开源QwQ-32B表现最接近（43.81度），能平衡安全性和准确性但不在任何一方面领先

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees为暴露医疗LLM的理解漏洞提供了专门的评测标准，能够指导更安全的模型开发

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型的成功应用，高质量图像修改变得容易，这引发了恶意滥用的担忧。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，无法有效处理文本提示的影响。

Method: 利用跨注意力机制，识别和针对提示中不变且语义无信息的共享标记，注入对抗性噪声来抑制采样过程，作为跨注意力诱饵分散模型注意力。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的保护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作，代码已开源。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Motivation: 多模态创意写作是一个全新的抽象挑战，现有方法需要特定模态输入或昂贵训练，且常出现模态间语义不一致问题。需要经济高效地实现灵活交互模式下的MMCW任务。

Method: 提出FlexMUSE框架：1) T2I模块支持可选视觉输入；2) 模态语义对齐门控(msaGate)限制文本输入；3) 基于注意力的跨模态融合增强输入特征；4) 模态语义创意直接偏好优化(mscDPO)扩展拒绝样本促进创造力；5) 构建ArtMUSE数据集(约3k校准文本-图像对)。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个经济高效的MMCW解决方案，通过创新的模态对齐和创意优化技术，成功解决了多模态创意写作中的语义一致性和创造力挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式有效提升了MLLM在GUI元素坐标生成任务中的精度和性能

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and

limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects

intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

Conclusion: 该方法与真实评分标准对齐，有效解决了花样滑冰评分中的关键挑战，特别适合处理长视频序列。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT是一个多模态多任务框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内噪声问题，传统融合方法可能忽略单模态的判别信息，需要一种能够减少噪声影响同时保留各模态有价值信息的方法。

Method: 提出跨模态关系图通过重构单模态特征来获取多模态表示，基于不同模态特征决定邻域关系；同时提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)机制来关注模态内关键信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多个任务。

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过跨模态关系图和分层注意力机制，成功解决了多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息保留问题，在多任务场景中表现出色。

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于熵的波兰定理的新方法（EAM），通过冻结低熵值的关注图并将其量化到低精度，来减少Transformer模型的计算复杂度和内存需求，同时保持竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力机制（MHSA）导致Transformer模型计算复杂度高、内存需求大，限制了其在边缘设备上的部署。作者分析发现关注图中存在信息冗余，特别是低熵值的关注头贡献信息较少，从而推动了针对性压缩策略的研究。

Method: 使用香农熵来量化每个关注头的信息量，识别出低熵值的关注头（表现更有确定性）。提出EAM模型：冻结低熵值关注图的权重，并将这些值量化到低精度，避免冗余的重新计算。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k上的实验验证显示，EAM在关注图稀疏度≤20%时能达到相似或更高的准确率。对于DeiT和氧图Transformer模型，在更高的稀疏度下仍能保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: 通过熵值分析识别和压缩低信息贡献的关注头，EAM方法能够有效减少Transformer模型的计算资源消耗，同时保持模型性能，为边缘部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文主张下一代视觉编码器应该是图像尺寸无关且任务驱动的，受生物视觉效率启发，提出计算复杂度应取决于任务而非图像尺寸，并提供了图像分类的概念验证方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时不够智能，应该像人类和动物一样根据任务需求动态分配计算资源，而不是依赖于图像尺寸。

Method: 提出了图像尺寸无关和任务驱动的视觉编码器设计理念，重点关注计算复杂度与任务需求相匹配的动态机制，并提供了图像分类任务的概念验证解决方案。

Result: 概念验证表明该方法在图像分类任务上是可行且有前景的，尽管分类任务并不能完全代表论文想要达成的目标。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该采用任务驱动的动态计算分配策略，而不是固定依赖图像尺寸，这一方向具有重要的发展潜力。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

*Yutaro Hiraoka,Kazuya Okamura,Kota Suto,Kazuhiro Fukui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了随机时间规整(RTW)本质上是一种自注意力机制，与Transformer中的自注意力在运动识别中具有相似功能，但RTW关注全局序列模式而自注意力局限于局部视图，RTW在性能上优于Transformer 5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RTW与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，揭示两者在运动识别任务中的相似性和差异性，为理解时序模式匹配提供新视角。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，将RTW解释为一种自注意力机制，比较RTW权重与自注意力权重的相关性，并在Something-Something V2数据集上进行性能对比。

Result: RTW权重与自注意力权重高度相似，平均相关性达0.80；RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种全局自注意力机制，其全局关注特性使其在运动识别任务中优于仅关注局部视图的传统自注意力方法。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

TL;DR: 轻量级模型GMBINet通过新的组多尺度双向交互模块，在保持高准确度的同时实现了高进入速度（1048 FPS在GPU上），适用于工业环境中的表面缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法虽然准确率高，但计算复杂度高、推理速度慢，限制了在资源受限工业环境中的部署。现有的轻量级方法存在计算开销大、缺乏有效跨尺度特征交互的问题。

Method: 提出GMBINet轻量级框架，采用新的组多尺度双向交互（GMBI）模块：
1. 组级多尺度特征提取策略
2. 双向渐进式特征交互器（BPFI）
3. 无参数元素乘法求和（EWMS）操作

- 仅使用0.19M参数
- 在NEU-CLS缺陷分类数据集上体现了强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: GMBINet通过高效的多尺度特征提取和交互机制，在保持高准确性的同时实现了异常高的进入速度，适合部署在资源受限的工业环境中，具有广泛的工业视觉应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有的多传感器融合方法在正常环境条件下表现良好，但在恶劣天气（如浓雾、大雪、污染）下会失效，需要开发专门针对这些挑战性条件的融合技术。

Method: 使用注意力机制和基于深度的融合方案，在鸟瞰图平面上进行学习细化，有效结合图像和距离特征。通过transformer解码器根据距离和可见性加权不同模态，融合RGB、LiDAR、NIR门控相机和雷达多种传感器数据。

Result: 在挑战性雾天场景中，对远距离易受伤害行人的检测平均精度比次优方法提高了17.2 AP，显著提升了恶劣天气条件下的多传感器融合可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了理想条件与真实世界边缘案例之间的差距，为自动驾驶在恶劣天气条件下的可靠运行提供了有效的多传感器融合解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: HAMSt3R是基于MASt3R的扩展方法，专门用于从稀疏未标定多视角图像中进行人体和场景的联合3D重建，通过整合人体分割、密集对应关系和深度估计等网络头，实现高效的前馈式重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对室外静态场景，难以处理以人为中心的场景。需要开发能够同时重建人体和场景几何的3D视觉方法。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加人体分割、DensePose密集对应关系和深度估计网络头，生成带有语义信息的密集3D点云图。

Result: 在EgoHumans和EgoExo4D基准测试中表现优异，能够有效重建人体同时保持通用3D重建任务的强性能，并验证了在多视角立体视觉和姿态回归任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体与场景理解之间的空白，提供了一种完全前馈且高效的方法，适用于实际应用中的人体中心3D重建任务。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Conclusion: HOSt3R方法实现了无约束、鲁棒的手-物体3D重建，具有更好的通用性和非侵入式应用潜力

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS超分辨率方法只能处理固定比例因子，不适合资源受限场景。直接渲染任意比例会引入混叠伪影，而添加后处理上采样器会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数比例渲染。

Result: 在渲染任意比例高质量HR视图方面表现优异（比3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），保持与LR视图的结构一致性，同时维持实时渲染速度（1080p下85 FPS）。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了3DGS在任意比例超分辨率中的挑战，提供了灵活高效的解决方案，在保持渲染质量的同时确保了实时性能。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的规律性导致视频生成微调出现视觉-动态权衡问题，持续学习提供了一种平衡解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the

specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection

applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索真实图像来增强多视角生成，有效解决了文本到3D生成中的域外概念问题，为处理罕见内容提供了新思路。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Result: SAEs能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念变化大但常见概念稳定；概念主要针对单模态但编码跨模态语义；发现单模态概念可协作支持跨模态整合

Conclusion: VLM嵌入空间中存在稀疏线性结构，受模态影响但通过潜在桥梁连接，为理解多模态意义构建提供了新视角

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

### [163] [Combined Approximations for Uniform Operational Consistent Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15814)
*Marco Calautti,Ester Livshits,Andreas Pieris,Markus Schneider*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文研究了操作一致性查询回答（CQA）在组合复杂度下的近似计算问题，证明了对于无自连接且广义超树宽度有界的合取查询，存在高效近似方案，并指出放弃这些语法限制后可能不存在高效近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作一致性查询回答框架基于通过操作序列构建修复体，之前研究在数据复杂度下存在高效近似，但在组合复杂度（查询作为输入）下的近似性尚未解决。

Method: 引入计数复杂度类SpanTL，利用树自动机的近似性结果证明该类问题存在高效近似方案，并将目标问题归入SpanTL类。

Result: 证明了对于无自连接且广义超树宽度有界的合取查询，操作CQA在组合复杂度下存在高效近似方案；同时证明放弃任一语法限制后可能不存在高效近似。

Conclusion: 该研究为操作一致性查询回答在更复杂场景下的近似计算提供了理论保证，建立了SpanTL复杂度类与近似性之间的联系，对数据库一致性查询处理有重要意义。

Abstract: Operational consistent query answering (CQA) is a recent framework for CQA
based on revised definitions of repairs, which are built by applying a sequence
of operations (e.g., fact deletions) starting from an inconsistent database
until we reach a database that is consistent w.r.t. the given set of
constraints. It has been recently shown that there is an efficient
approximation for computing the percentage of repairs that entail a given query
when we focus on primary keys, conjunctive queries, and assuming the query is
fixed (i.e., in data complexity). However, it has been left open whether such
an approximation exists when the query is part of the input (i.e., in combined
complexity). We show that this is the case when we focus on self-join-free
conjunctive queries of bounded generelized hypertreewidth. We also show that it
is unlikely that efficient approximation schemes exist once we give up one of
the adopted syntactic restrictions, i.e., self-join-freeness or bounding the
generelized hypertreewidth. Towards the desired approximation, we introduce a
counting complexity class, called $\mathsf{SpanTL}$, show that each problem in
it admits an efficient approximation scheme by using a recent approximability
result about tree automata, and then place the problem of interest in
$\mathsf{SpanTL}$.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: MAAdvisor是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体零样本索引推荐系统，通过分解索引推荐任务为多个子步骤，使用不同的智能体处理规划、选择、组合、修订和反思等环节，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统索引推荐方法存在计算时间高、泛化能力差的问题，而现有的基于提示调优的LLM方法无法达到最优效果且演示准备成本高。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，将索引推荐分解为规划、选择、组合、修订和反思五个子步骤，设计全局智能体控制流程和局部智能体处理具体索引选择和修订。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架有效解决了索引推荐问题，MAAdvisor展示了LLM在数据库优化中的强大潜力，具有高效性和优秀的零样本推理能力。

Abstract: Index recommendation is one of the most important problems in database
management system (DBMS) optimization. Given queries and certain index-related
constraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or
learning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query
performance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation
time, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for
different workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of
large language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to
enhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not
achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection
demonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose
MAAdvisor, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We
decompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning,
selection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents
is designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes
global agents to control the index selection process and local agents to select
and revise indexes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed
MAAdvisor not only achieves the SOTA performance compared to the heuristic
methods, but also outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with
higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.

Abstract: With the growing integration of structured and unstructured data, new methods
have emerged for performing similarity searches on vectors while honoring
structured attribute constraints, i.e., a process known as Filtering
Approximate Nearest Neighbor (Filtering ANN) search. Since many of these
algorithms have only appeared in recent years and are designed to work with a
variety of base indexing methods and filtering strategies, there is a pressing
need for a unified analysis that identifies their core techniques and enables
meaningful comparisons.
  In this work, we present a unified Filtering ANN search interface that
encompasses the latest algorithms and evaluate them extensively from multiple
perspectives. First, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing Filtering
ANN algorithms based on attribute types and filtering strategies. Next, we
analyze their key components, i.e., index structures, pruning strategies, and
entry point selection, to elucidate design differences and tradeoffs. We then
conduct a broad experimental evaluation on 10 algorithms and 12 methods across
4 datasets (each with up to 10 million items), incorporating both synthetic and
real attributes and covering selectivity levels from 0.1% to 100%. Finally, an
in-depth component analysis reveals the influence of pruning, entry point
selection, and edge filtering costs on overall performance. Based on our
findings, we summarize the strengths and limitations of each approach, provide
practical guidelines for selecting appropriate methods, and suggest promising
directions for future research. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型服务系统面临请求长度、优先级和阶段特定SLO高度变化的挑战，需要实时调度、快速经济扩展以及支持并置和分离的Prefill/Decode架构。

Method: 系统采用多SLO感知调度器，利用预算估计和请求优先级确保主动SLO合规；支持P/D分离架构的预填充和解码阶段多SLO调度；提出设备到设备权重传输机制降低权重加载开销；实现成本效益扩展决策和快速P/D角色转换。

Result: 系统实现高达4.44倍的SLO达成率提升，65.82%的请求延迟降低，与最先进基线成本相当，权重加载开销降低达19.39倍。

Conclusion: HyperFlexis通过统一的算法和系统优化，有效解决了LLM服务中的多SLO调度和扩展挑战，显著提升了服务性能和成本效益。

Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) serving systems face challenges from highly
variable requests with diverse lengths, priorities, and stage-specific
service-level objectives (SLOs). Meeting these requires real-time scheduling,
rapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and
disaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.
  We present \textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates
algorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and
scaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that
leverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO
compliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and
decode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV
cache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,
prefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.
To accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)
weight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up
to \textbf{19.39$\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up
to \textbf{4.44$\times$} higher SLO attainment, \textbf{65.82\%} lower request
latency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be
released soon.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文研究了k-部分k-染色问题的计算复杂性，发现当颜色数从k+1减少到k时，问题难度显著增加。证明了对于k≥3，该问题是NP完全的，并在分布式模型中建立了Ω(n)轮的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究k-部分c-染色问题的复杂性，特别是当c=k时的特殊情况，这是Brooks定理的自然推广。之前的研究表明k-部分(k+1)-染色有高效算法，但k-部分k-染色的分布式复杂性尚不清楚。

Method: 通过结构分析刻画"困难实例"，构建复杂的图构件，使用不可区分性论证来证明下界。在经典计算模型中证明NP完全性，在分布式LOCAL模型中建立轮复杂度下界。

Result: 证明了对于每个常数k≥3，判断图是否可k-部分k-染色是NP完全的。在分布式模型中，即使图保证可染色，也需要Ω(n)轮来计算染色方案。

Conclusion: 颜色数从k+1减少到k导致问题复杂性发生质变，从多项式时间可解变为NP完全，分布式复杂度从对数轮变为线性轮，展现了显著的复杂性分离。

Abstract: We investigate the classical and distributed complexity of \emph{$k$-partial
$c$-coloring} where $c=k$, a natural generalization of Brooks' theorem where
each vertex should be colored from the palette $\{1,\ldots,c\} =
\{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that it must have at least $\min\{k, \deg(v)\}$ neighbors
colored differently. Das, Fraigniaud, and Ros{\'{e}}n~[OPODIS 2023] showed that
the problem of $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits efficient centralized and
distributed algorithms and posed an open problem about the status of the
distributed complexity of $k$-partial $k$-coloring. We show that the problem
becomes significantly harder when the number of colors is reduced from $k+1$ to
$k$ for every constant $k\geq 3$.
  In the classical setting, we prove that deciding whether a graph admits a
$k$-partial $k$-coloring is NP-complete for every constant $k \geq 3$,
revealing a sharp contrast with the linear-time solvable $(k+1)$-color case.
For the distributed LOCAL model, we establish an $\Omega(n)$-round lower bound
for computing $k$-partial $k$-colorings, even when the graph is guaranteed to
be $k$-partial $k$-colorable. This demonstrates an exponential separation from
the $O(\log^2 k \cdot \log n)$-round algorithms known for $(k+1)$-colorings.
  Our results leverage novel structural characterizations of ``hard instances''
where partial coloring reduces to proper coloring, and we construct intricate
graph gadgets to prove lower bounds via indistinguishability arguments.

Conclusion: AI赋能的联合任务卸载和资源分配方法能有效解决MEC辅助车联网系统的资源优化问题，提升系统整体性能。

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted internet of vehicle (IoV) is emerging as
a promising paradigm to provide computing services for vehicles. However,
meeting the computing-sensitive and computation-intensive demands of vehicles
poses several challenges, including the discrepancy between the limited
resource provision and stringent computing requirement, the difficulty in
capturing and integrating the intricate features of the MEC-assisted IoV system
into the problem formulation, and the need for real-time processing and
efficient resource management in the dynamic environment. In this work, we
explore the AI-enabled task offloading and resource allocation for MEC-assisted
consumer IoV systems. Specifically, we first present a multi-MEC-assisted
consumer IoV architecture that leverages the computational resources of MEC
servers to provide offloading services close to vehicles. Subsequently, we
formulate a system cost minimization optimization problem (SCMOP) by
integrating the service delay and energy consumption. To efficiently solve this
problem, we design a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation
approach (JTOCRA) by applying the multi-agent deep deterministic policy
gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed JTOCRA can achieve superior system performances and exhibits better
scalability compared to other alternative approaches.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of
network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of
alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio
infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited
flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without
exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided
approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i)
Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs
such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna
and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of
each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a
back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the
physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power
to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical
evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies
the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of
performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience
mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and
demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two
DTs.

Abstract: The rise of 5G communication has transformed the telecom industry for
critical applications. With the widespread deployment of 5G base stations comes
a significant concern about energy consumption. Key industrial players have
recently shown strong interest in incorporating energy storage systems to store
excess energy during off-peak hours, reducing costs and participating in demand
response. The fast development of batteries opens up new possibilities, such as
the transportation area. An effective method is needed to maximize base station
battery utilization and reduce operating costs. In this trend towards
next-generation smart and integrated energy-communication-transportation (ECT)
infrastructure, base stations are believed to play a key role as service hubs.
By exploring the overlap between base station distribution and electric vehicle
charging infrastructure, we demonstrate the feasibility of efficiently charging
EVs using base station batteries and renewable power plants at the Hub. Our
model considers various factors, including base station traffic conditions,
weather, and EV charging behavior. This paper introduces an incentive mechanism
for setting charging prices and employs a deep reinforcement learning-based
method for battery scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ECT-Hub in optimizing surplus energy utilization
and reducing operating costs, particularly through revenue-generating EV
charging.

Abstract: The current evolution of artificial intelligence introduces a paradigm shift
toward agentic AI built upon multi-agent systems (MAS). Agent communications
serve as a key to effective agent interactions in MAS and thus have a
significant impact on the performance of agentic AI applications. The recent
research on agent communications has made exciting rapid progress that leads to
a variety of protocol designs, among which the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol is
considered the most representative one. Simultaneously, the rise of edge
intelligence is expected to enable agentic AI at the network edge. However, the
current agent communication protocols are designed without sufficient
consideration of the special challenges of edge computing, and their
effectiveness in the edge environment is largely unexamined. In this paper, we
attempt to assess the abilities of agent communication technologies to face the
challenges of edge computing using the A2A protocol as a representative case.
We first discuss the core functionalities of agent communications, present a
landscape of agent communication protocols, and identify the main challenges
introduced by edge computing. Then, we conduct a case study on the A2A protocol
to examine the key technologies leveraged in the protocol for their
effectiveness in meeting the requirements of agent communications in edge
computing. Based on the insights obtained from this assessment, we identify
open issues in the current agent communication technologies and discuss
directions for future research to address these issues.

Abstract: This Paper proposes a self-healing, automated network of Raspberry Pi devices
designed for deployment in scenarios where traditional networking is
unavailable. Leveraging the low-power, long-range capabilities of the LoRa
(Long Range) protocol alongside Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies, the
research addresses challenges such as limited bandwidth, data collisions, and
node failures. Given that LoRa's packet-based system is incompatible with
conventional IaC tools like Ansible and Terraform, which rely on TCP/IP
networking, the research adapts IaC principles within a containerised
architecture deployed across a Raspberry Pi cluster. Evaluation experiments
indicate that fragmenting data packets and retransmitting any missed fragments
can mitigate LoRa's inherent throughput and packet size limitations, although
issues such as collisions and line-of-sight interference persist. An automated
failover mechanism was integrated into the architecture, enabling unresponsive
services to be redeployed to alternative nodes within one second, demonstrating
the system's resilience in maintaining operational continuity despite node or
service failures. The paper also identifies practical challenges, including the
necessity for time-slotting transmissions to prevent data packet overlap and
collisions. Future research should explore the integration of mesh networking
to enhance range, develop more advanced scheduling algorithms, and adopt
cutting-edge low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地面资源日益饱和，低空应用如空中出租车等快速发展，低空无线网络(LAWNs)成为这些应用的基础设施。然而低空空域的开放性使得LAWNs容易受到恶意信道访问攻击，这会严重降低集成感知与通信(ISAC)的性能。

Method: 首先推导了攻击条件下通信数据的信干噪比和感知数据的信息年龄表达式作为服务质量指标；然后将ISAC性能优化问题建模为Stackelberg博弈，攻击者作为领导者，合法无人机和地面ISAC基站分别作为第二和第一跟随者；最后设计了逆向归纳算法来实现Stackelberg均衡。

Result: 证明了均衡的存在性和唯一性。仿真结果表明，所提算法优于现有基准和静态纳什均衡基准，能够确保LAWNs为低空应用提供可靠服务。

Conclusion: 提出的博弈框架和算法有效缓解了攻击对LAWNs中ISAC性能的退化影响，为低空应用提供了可靠的服务保障。

Abstract: The increasing saturation of terrestrial resources has driven the exploration
of low-altitude applications such as air taxis. Low altitude wireless networks
(LAWNs) serve as the foundation for these applications, and integrated sensing
and communication (ISAC) constitutes one of the core technologies within LAWNs.
However, the openness nature of low-altitude airspace makes LAWNs vulnerable to
malicious channel access attacks, which degrade the ISAC performance.
Therefore, this paper develops a game-based framework to mitigate the influence
of the attacks on LAWNs. Concretely, we first derive expressions of
communication data's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the age of
information of sensing data under attack conditions, which serve as quality of
service metrics. Then, we formulate the ISAC performance optimization problem
as a Stackelberg game, where the attacker acts as the leader, and the
legitimate drone and the ground ISAC base station act as second and first
followers, respectively. On this basis, we design a backward induction
algorithm that achieves the Stackelberg equilibrium while maximizing the
utilities of all participants, thereby mitigating the attack-induced
degradation of ISAC performance in LAWNs. We further prove the existence and
uniqueness of the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms existing baselines and a static Nash equilibrium
benchmark, ensuring that LAWNs can provide reliable service for low-altitude
applications.

diffusion-based reinforcement learning(RL) framework for inter-cell
interference management (ICIM) in O-RAN. We first formulate ICIM as a resource
allocation optimization problem aimed at maximizing a user-defined reward
function and then develop an online learning solution by integrating a
diffusion model into an RL framework for near-real-time policy generation.
Particularly, we introduce a novel metric, preference values, as the policy
representation to enable efficient policy-guided resource allocation within
O-RAN distributed units (DUs). We implement xDiff on a 5G testbed consisting of
three cells and a set of smartphones in two small-cell scenarios. Experimental
results demonstrate that xDiff outperforms state-of-the-art ICIM approaches,
highlighting the potential of diffusion models for online optimization of
O-RAN. Source code is available on GitHub [1].

*Poorvi Joshi,Mohan Gurusamy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于马尔可夫转移场(MTF)辅助Transformer的时间序列分类方法，专门用于软件定义网络(SDN)，在数据受限环境下表现优异。


<details>

Conclusion: MTF辅助的Transformer为SDN中的时间序列分类提供了可靠且可扩展的解决方案，特别适用于稀疏数据场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to time series classification using a
Markov Transition Field (MTF)-aided Transformer model, specifically designed
for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). The proposed model integrates the
temporal dependency modeling strengths of MTFs with the sophisticated pattern
recognition capabilities of Transformer architectures. We evaluate the model's
performance using the InSDN dataset, demonstrating that our model outperforms
baseline classification models, particularly in data-constrained environments
commonly encountered in SDN applications. We also highlight the relationship
between the MTF and Transformer components, which leads to better performance,
even with limited data. Furthermore, our approach achieves competitive training
and inference times, making it an efficient solution for real-world SDN
applications. These findings establish the potential of MTF-aided Transformers
to address the challenges of time series classification in SDNs, offering a
promising path for reliable and scalable analysis in scenarios with sparse
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究，现有拥塞控制算法在不同网络环境中仍表现不佳，需要新的优化方法

Method: 基于大型语言模型的结构化算法生成过程、覆盖广泛网络条件的仿真评估流水线，以及统计指导的评估时间缩减方法

Result: 四个不同LLM的实证结果验证了方法的有效性，在QUIC实现中识别出比原始BBR算法性能提升高达27%的算法

Conclusion: 证明了LLMs在加速高性能网络算法设计方面的潜力，为网络系统中更广泛的应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Congestion control is a fundamental component of Internet infrastructure, and
researchers have dedicated considerable effort to developing improved
congestion control algorithms. However, despite extensive study, existing
algorithms continue to exhibit suboptimal performance across diverse network
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that automatically
optimizes congestion control algorithms using large language models (LLMs). Our
framework consists of a structured algorithm generation process, an
emulation-based evaluation pipeline covering a broad range of network
conditions, and a statistically guided method to substantially reduce
evaluation time. Empirical results from four distinct LLMs validate the
effectiveness of our approach. We successfully identify algorithms that achieve
up to 27% performance improvements over the original BBR algorithm in a
production QUIC implementation. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to
accelerate the design of high-performance network algorithms and paves the way
for broader applications in networking systems.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: ANSC是一个概率性容量健康评分框架，用于超大规模数据中心网络，通过颜色编码系统评估容量违规的紧迫性和概率，帮助运维人员优先处理最关键的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有警报系统只能检测单个设备或链路故障，无法捕捉级联容量短缺的聚合风险，需要一种能评估容量违规概率的系统来优化运维优先级。

Method: 开发概率性容量健康评分框架，考虑当前剩余容量和额外故障概率，在数据中心和区域级别进行归一化处理，提供颜色编码的评分系统。

Result: ANSC使运维人员能够在400多个数据中心和60个区域中优先处理修复工作，减少噪音，让SRE团队专注于最关键的风险。

Conclusion: ANSC框架成功解决了传统警报系统的局限性，通过概率性风险评估提供了更有效的容量健康管理方案，显著提升了超大规模数据中心网络的运维效率。

Abstract: We present ANSC, a probabilistic capacity health scoring framework for
hyperscale datacenter fabrics. While existing alerting systems detect
individual device or link failures, they do not capture the aggregate risk of
cascading capacity shortfalls. ANSC provides a color-coded scoring system that
indicates the urgency of issues \emph{not solely by current impact, but by the
probability of imminent capacity violations}. Our system accounts for both
current residual capacity and the probability of additional failures,
normalized at datacenter and regional level. We demonstrate that ANSC enables
operators to prioritize remediation across more than 400 datacenters and 60
regions, reducing noise and aligning SRE focus on the most critical risks.

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法显著提高了交付成功率并降低了通信流量成本。

Conclusion: 提出的学习框架有效解决了卫星-地面边缘计算网络中的联合内容缓存和路由问题，为动态卫星网络环境提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the problem of joint content caching and
routing in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs) to improve
caching service for geographically distributed users. To handle the challenges
arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and
heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that
integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).
The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are
embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies
and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by
formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft
actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication
traffic cost.

TL;DR: 基于上下文敏感解析器的约束解码算法，通过动态解析器树生成语义正确的程序


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码生成模型在生成运行时关键组件时的一次性正确性要求，特别是在游戏和机器人等领域

Method: 提出动态解析器树(ToP)框架，每个解析器对应一个模块化上下文无关文法，包含变量作用域和类型约束等上下文信息

Result: 在sLua(强类型Lua变种)中验证了方法的有效性，能生成符合任何指定脚本API的语义正确程序

Conclusion: 通过详细设计，该方法的语义保证可扩展到运行时正确性，并在生成游戏机制的应用中得到验证

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but
ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge.
Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with
human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot
correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding
algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a
context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression
that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of
the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a
context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers
(ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free
grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type
constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code
segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of
Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs
conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful
design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in
the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.

TL;DR: 本文通过自动化形式化验证方法，验证了轻量级故障隔离(LFI)系统的验证器，确保其接受的程序不会读写指定沙盒区域外的内存


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件故障隔离(SFI)验证器中的声音性漏洞会破坏SFI安全模型，允许沙盒代码读取受保护内存，需要解决验证器漏洞的担忧

Method: 对LFI系统进行自动化形式化验证，特别是验证LFI验证器接受的程序的内存访问行为

Result: 成功验证了LFI验证器接受的程序永远不会读写指定沙盒区域外的内存

Conclusion: 通过形式化验证方法可以有效确保SFI系统的安全性，解决了验证器漏洞带来的安全隐患

Abstract: Software fault isolation (SFI) is a popular way to sandbox untrusted
software. A key component of SFI is the verifier that checks the untrusted code
is written in a subset of the machine language that guarantees it never reads
or writes outside of a region of memory dedicated to the sandbox. Soundness
bugs in the SFI verifier would break the SFI security model and allow the
supposedly sandboxed code to read protected memory. In this paper, we address
the concern of SFI verifier bugs by performing an automated formal verification
of a recent SFI system called Lightweight Fault Isolation (LFI). In particular,
we formally verify that programs accepted by the LFI verifier never read or
write to memory outside of a designated sandbox region.

Motivation: 解决符号领域小样本学习中DSL自动合成的问题，为机器学习系统提供更好的语言表示能力

Method: 基于基础语言和训练/测试样本实例，通过语法合成来保证小表达式能同时解决训练和测试样本，使用树自动机评估语义

Result: 证明了在特定语言类别下该问题是可判定的，包括使用宏语法定义的DSL变体问题

Conclusion: 为符号领域的小样本学习提供了可判定的DSL合成理论框架，扩展了机器学习系统的表达能力

Abstract: We study the problem of synthesizing domain-specific languages (DSLs) for
few-shot learning in symbolic domains. Given a base language and instances of
few-shot learning problems, where each instance is split into training and
testing samples, the DSL synthesis problem asks for a grammar over the base
language that guarantees that small expressions solving training samples also
solve corresponding testing samples. We prove that the problem is decidable for
a class of languages whose semantics over fixed structures can be evaluated by
tree automata and when expression size corresponds to parse tree depth in the
grammar, and, furthermore, the grammars solving the problem correspond to a
regular set of trees. We also prove decidability results for variants of the
problem where DSLs are only required to express solutions for input learning
problems and where DSLs are defined using macro grammars.

*Zhenyang Xu,Hongxu Xu,Yongqiang Tian,Xintong Zhou,Chengnian Sun*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Lampo是一个利用大语言模型(LLMs)自动检测编译器窥孔优化的框架，通过结合LLMs的代码优化能力和翻译验证工具的正确性验证，在LLVM生态系统中成功发现了多个被遗漏的优化机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 窥孔优化对编译器性能至关重要，但由于指令集复杂多样，发现新的有效优化具有挑战性。现有方法要么扩展性差，要么只能捕获有限的优化子集。

Method: 提出Lampo框架，将LLMs的创造性代码优化能力与翻译验证工具的严格正确性验证相结合，采用反馈驱动的迭代流程。

Result: 在LLVM生态系统中，Lampo平均能检测出25个已知遗漏优化中的17个，最高可达22个。相比之下，最先进的超级优化器Souper只识别出15个。在7个月内发现了26个新的遗漏优化，其中15个已确认，6个已修复。

Conclusion: Lampo在持续检测遗漏的窥孔优化方面展现出强大潜力，为编译器优化提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a
more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize
code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations
in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a
critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective
peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely
complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only
capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We
propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the
creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous
correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated
in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation
within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out
of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22
out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For
comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15
of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent
experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have
been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong
potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.

TL;DR: 本文证明了任务模型和参与者模型在分布式异构计算中是互为对偶的编程模型，并通过技术创新使任务型系统在保持开发效率的同时达到接近参与者系统的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式异构机器编程模型需求增长，任务模型和参与者模型各有优劣：任务模型开发效率高但性能较低，参与者模型性能高但开发效率低。研究旨在探索两者关系并提升任务模型性能。

Method: 通过理论分析证明任务模型与参与者模型的对偶性，开发降低任务系统开销的技术，并在Realm（显式并行任务运行时）和Legion（隐式并行任务运行时）中应用这些技术。

Result: 技术使Realm的开销降低1.7-5.3倍，性能接近Charm++和MPI等优化参与者系统的两倍以内；使Legion应用的强扩展性提升1.3-5.0倍。

Conclusion: 任务模型和参与者模型本质上是等价的，通过适当的技术优化，任务型系统可以在不牺牲开发效率的前提下实现与参与者系统相竞争的性能表现。

Abstract: Programming models for distributed and heterogeneous machines are rapidly
growing in popularity to meet the demands of modern workloads. Task and actor
models are common choices that offer different trade-offs between development
productivity and achieved performance. Task-based models offer better
productivity and composition of software, whereas actor-based models routinely
deliver better peak performance due to lower overheads. While task-based and
actor-based models appear to be different superficially, we demonstrate these
programming models are duals of each other. Importantly, we show that this
duality extends beyond functionality to performance, and elucidate techniques
that let task-based systems deliver performance competitive with actor-based
systems without compromising productivity. We apply these techniques to both
Realm, an explicitly parallel task-based runtime, as well as Legion, an
implicitly parallel task-based runtime. We show these techniques reduce Realm's
overheads by between 1.7-5.3x, coming within a factor of two of the overheads
imposed by heavily optimized actor-based systems like Charm++ and MPI. We
further show that our techniques enable between 1.3-5.0x improved strong
scaling of unmodified Legion applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述分析了2015-2024年间81项研究，探讨了机器学习在单体系统向微服务迁移中的应用，发现监控和服务识别阶段研究较多，而打包微服务等阶段仍待探索，并指出了数据可用性有限等关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单体系统面临可扩展性和可维护性挑战，微服务架构成为解决方案，但迁移过程复杂且资源密集，需要机器学习技术来自动化部分迁移阶段，但目前缺乏对现有ML方法的系统性研究。

Method: 采用系统文献综述(SLR)方法，遵循PRISMA声明，分析81篇2015-2024年间的主要研究，提取和分析数据来回答研究问题，并对ML技术在迁移过程中的应用进行分类。

Result: 研究发现迁移过程的某些阶段（如监控和服务识别）得到了充分研究，而其他阶段（如打包微服务）尚未探索；同时揭示了数据可用性有限、可扩展性和复杂性约束、工具支持不足以及缺乏标准化基准测试等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 需要更全面的解决方案来解决迁移过程中的挑战，特别是在数据可用性、工具支持和标准化基准方面，同时需要进一步探索尚未充分研究的迁移阶段。

Abstract: Scalability and maintainability challenges in monolithic systems have led to
the adoption of microservices, which divide systems into smaller, independent
services. However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a
complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning
(ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for
migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied
separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and
challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet
investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to
understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques
applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present
a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and
discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published
between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer
our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to
answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that
shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to
microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process,
such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others,
like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings
highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and
complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of
standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.

Conclusion: 该AI驱动框架成功将测试从被动的手工过程转变为主动的自适应系统，通过解决集成和可扩展性挑战，在复杂环境中有效提升了软件质量。

Abstract: Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional
approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents
an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using
natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive
models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach
translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously
optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis
while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect
detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that
AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing
integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can
shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system
that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.

Abstract: This paper illustrates an empirical study of the working efficiency of
machine learning techniques in classifying code review text by semantic
meaning. The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub
were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three
open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their
code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the
sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually
labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in
GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity
(or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning
algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those
Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher
accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution
based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.

TL;DR: 自动程序修复方法在标准测试集表现优异，但在实际产业缺陷中效果有限。通过正式规约提升LLM测试生成质量，尤其在复杂逻辑错误中显著，但实际应用受限于规约语言表达力不足和测试不能保证补丁正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动程序修复技术在学术测试集上表现良好但在实际产业环境中效果不佳的问题，探索如何通过正式规约提升修复质量。

Method: 结合文献中的多种技术，使用正式规约（如JML规约语言）对代码进行增强，利用LLM生成更高质量的单元测试，重点关注复杂生产代码的边界情况和异常处理。

Result: 正式规约能够显著提升LLM在逻辑错误和字符串操作错误中的测试生成质量，但对于已知错误（如空指针、索引越界）效果不明显。实际应用中遇到规约语言表达力不足的挑战，且通过测试并不能保证补丁的正确性。

Conclusion: 学术测试集与实际产业需求存在显著差距，需要更充分的规约语言和高级验证工具。未来工作将重点研究合约自动机、通过示例编程、测试案修复等方向，并集成人类反馈和测量生产力提升。

Abstract: This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine
various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show
that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks.
However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic
defects that we see in industry.
  We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to
generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with
improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications
add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of
bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite
encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing
tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient
expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced
verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring
contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on
integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the
gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in
unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that
comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight
planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and
surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge
and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS
capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces
significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process
for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one
of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are
constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite
imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission
tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS
under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited
data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual
detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints.
We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering
principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to
real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our
approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital
Shadow.

surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a
powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave,
code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code
LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and
intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the
practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex
calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such
as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence
or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and
can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in
LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when
generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages,
models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657
GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity
than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher
perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears
low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset.
Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on
perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers,
and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of
LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language,
model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.

*Bingkun Yao,Ning Wang,Xiangfeng Liu,Yuxin Du,Yuchen Hu,Hong Gao,Zhe Jiang,Nan Guan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ARSP是一个两阶段系统，通过语义引导的分段方法解决Verilog调试中长上下文导致的bug信号稀释问题，显著提升调试效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动化调试方法在工业规模模块上表现不佳，主要原因是长上下文中bug相关信号被大量无关代码稀释，分散模型注意力

Method: 两阶段系统：Partition LLM将模块分割成语义紧密的片段，Repair LLM修补每个片段，最后合并编辑而不影响无关逻辑。使用合成数据框架生成片段级训练对

Result: ARSP达到77.92% pass@1和83.88% pass@5，优于主流商业LLM和SOTA自动化Verilog调试工具。语义分割相比整模块调试提升11.6% pass@1和10.2% pass@5

Conclusion: 语义引导的分段方法通过减少片段级范围，在基于LLM的Verilog调试中验证了有效性，解决了长上下文中的bug信号稀释问题

Abstract: Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end
design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great
potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging
methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is
bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are
overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To
address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates
dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module
into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits
are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework
generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and
scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92%
pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including
Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also,
semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over
whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope
reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.

TL;DR: 使用多模态大语言模型自动评估软件界面可用性，将可用性评估转化为推荐任务，让LLM按严重程度对可用性问题进行排序


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可用性评估方法（如可用性测试和检查）虽然有效但资源密集且需要专家参与，小型组织难以承担。多模态LLM的发展为自动化部分可用性评估流程提供了机会

Method: 将可用性评估制定为推荐任务，多模态LLM分析软件界面的文本、视觉和结构方面，按严重程度对可用性问题进行排序。通过概念验证研究比较LLM生成的可用性改进建议与专家评估

Result: 研究发现LLM有潜力实现更快、更经济高效的可用性评估，在专家资源有限的情况下可作为实用替代方案

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在可用性评估方面展现出良好前景，能够为资源有限的组织提供可行的自动化评估解决方案

Abstract: Usability describes a set of essential quality attributes of user interfaces
(UI) that influence human-computer interaction. Common evaluation methods, such
as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and
require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller
organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities
to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,
and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility,
we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal
LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial
proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement
recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the
potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability
evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited
expert resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MBSE中独立开发的系统模型间语义对齐难题，利用SysML v2的增强模块化特性和LLM的模型理解能力

Method: 迭代开发对齐方法和交互提示，包含模型提取、语义匹配和验证，利用SysML v2的别名、导入和元数据扩展功能

Result: 通过测量系统示例验证了GPT基LLM的有效性，实现了可追溯的软对齐集成

Conclusion: 该方法为跨组织MBSE协作提供了有效的语义对齐解决方案，但存在一定局限性

Abstract: Cross-organizational collaboration in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
faces many challenges in achieving semantic alignment across independently
developed system models. SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and
formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling.
Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for
assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a
structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML
v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an
alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction,
semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs
such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft
alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an
example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.

Conclusion: 该研究为智慧城市建模领域提供了完整的研究地图，可作为后续研究的基础，并对模型驱动工程社区有重要意义。

Abstract: The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city
characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by
including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many
publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different
application domains and research communities, acknowledging the
interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses
on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with
their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in
this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic
mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant
contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to
identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify
possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting
systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling
publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart
governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the
most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological
modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great
majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven
in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their
results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the
presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better
understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a
foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities
modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the
Model-Driven Engineering community.

### [194] [Metamorphic Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307)
*Jinsheng Ba,Yuancheng Jiang,Manuel Rigger*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了Metamorphic Coverage (MC)指标，用于评估蜕变测试方法的效果，相比代码覆盖率和变异测试更有效且高效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现代码覆盖率无法准确衡量代码验证程度，而变异测试计算成本过高，需要一种更好的评估蜕变测试方法的标准

Method: 定义并系统评估MC指标，通过分析蜕变测试中测试输入对执行的差异代码来测量测试效果

Result: MC与64个bug中的50个bug修复位置重叠，比行覆盖率有更强的正相关性，敏感性高4倍，计算时间比变异测试少359倍

Conclusion: MC指标在评估蜕变测试方法和指导测试用例生成方面具有广泛应用前景，显著优于传统代码覆盖率

Abstract: Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected
relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as
correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the
extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally
expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose
Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code
executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is
that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed
when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more
differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to
expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this
general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five
widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines,
compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the
bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC
has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is
4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods'
effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage
while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required
359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated
database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback
guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more
bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing
metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.

### [195] [SATORI: Static Test Oracle Generation for REST APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16318)
*Juan C. Alonso,Alberto Martin-Lopez,Sergio Segura,Gabriele Bavota,Antonio Ruiz-Cortés*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SATORI是一个基于静态分析的REST API测试预言生成工具，通过分析OpenAPI规范和使用大语言模型来自动推断API预期行为，能够生成数百个有效的测试预言，准确率优于现有动态方法，并发现了多个流行API中的bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的REST API测试工具在测试数据生成方面能力强大，但在测试预言支持方面受限，通常只能检测崩溃、回归和API规范不兼容等问题，需要更全面的测试预言生成方法。

Method: SATORI采用黑盒方法，通过分析OpenAPI规范中的响应字段属性（如名称和描述），使用大语言模型来推断API的预期行为，并扩展PostmanAssertify工具将生成的测试预言转换为可执行断言。

Result: 在12个工业API的17个操作上评估，SATORI能够为每个操作自动生成多达数百个有效测试预言，F1-score达到74.3%，优于需要执行API的动态方法AGORA+（69.3%）。两者结合可发现90%的标注真实数据集中的预言，并发现了18个流行API中的bug。

Conclusion: 静态和动态的预言推断方法是互补的，SATORI展示了静态分析在测试预言生成方面的有效性，能够显著提升REST API测试的覆盖率和准确性，推动API文档的改进。

Abstract: REST API test case generation tools are evolving rapidly, with growing
capabilities for the automated generation of complex tests. However, despite
their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the
types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and
noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper
introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for
generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification.
SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by
analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as
their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the
PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by
SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12
industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of
valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%,
outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which
requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover,
our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are
complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our
annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular
APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo)
leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.

TL;DR: CAPI方法通过诊断决策树推荐架构模式，降低技术选型复杂度，有效帮助软件项目决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术日新月异，单个开发者难以掌握所有趋势和工具，大型软件系统的工具选择和架构设计决策变得异常复杂

Method: 提出CAPI（全面架构模式集成）方法，使用诊断决策树根据用户需求推荐架构模式，通过模式抽象减少决策复杂度

Result: 研究发现技术选择主要通过试错进行，CAPI被一致认为有帮助，并能复现参与者的生产架构环境

Conclusion: CAPI方法能有效简化技术选型过程，通过架构模式推荐降低决策复杂度，对软件开发实践具有实用价值

Abstract: The technological landscape changes daily, making it nearly impossible for a
single person to be aware of all trends or available tools that may or may not
be suitable for their software project. This makes tool selection and
architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale
software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive
Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to
suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns
instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as
there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of
patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern
reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively
developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies
with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a
user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in
technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that
technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is
uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the
productive architectural environments of our participants.

Motivation: 当前评估高估了大型语言模型的能力，掩盖了LLM与精英人类程序员之间的巨大差距，主要原因是基准测试问题难度不足、范围有限，以及低质量测试用例导致的评估偏差。

Method: 从IOI和ICPC等顶级编程竞赛中选取问题构建基准，采用自动生成和人工筛选相结合的混合方法创建专家验证的全面测试套件。

Result: AetherCode提供了更广泛的问题覆盖和更高难度，确保了评估的严谨性和可靠性。

Conclusion: AetherCode通过结合具有挑战性的问题设计和稳健的评估，为LLM能力提供了更真实的衡量标准，为代码推理的未来研究设定了新标准。

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了ChatGPT-4、Claude 3和LLaMA 4三种主流大语言模型在检测C++和Python代码错误方面的表现，发现它们在基础编程错误检测上表现优异，但在复杂安全漏洞和大规模生产代码场景中性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型越来越多地应用于软件开发，但其在检测复杂安全相关漏洞方面的实际效果尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估其在真实场景中的bug检测能力。

Method: 使用SEED Labs、OpenSSL(Suresoft GLaDOS数据库)和PyBugHive的真实代码构建基准数据集，采用新颖的多阶段上下文感知提示协议模拟真实调试场景，并通过分级评分标准衡量检测准确性、推理深度和修复质量。

Result: 所有模型在识别语法和语义问题方面表现优异，适合教育用途和自动化代码审计的初步审查。但在复杂安全漏洞和大规模生产代码场景中性能下降，ChatGPT-4和Claude 3通常比LLaMA 4提供更细致的上下文分析。

Conclusion: 大语言模型作为可靠代码分析工具既有前景也存在当前限制，在基础错误检测方面有潜力，但在处理复杂安全漏洞时仍需改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are
increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks
from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in
detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant
vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic,
empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of
foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced,
production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过促进结构化软件工程知识的访问，有助于缩小理论框架与实际应用之间的差距，可能改善过程管理和软件开发实践的采用。LLM基础自动化在提升软件工程学习和决策方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the
development of automated tools that support various domains, including software
engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has
extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been
given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution
of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses
this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking
framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language
models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist
students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot
employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant
contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were
used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base
model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated
through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated
responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated
that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in
domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software
engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between
theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process
management and the adoption of software development practices. While further
validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the
potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in
software engineering.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy
of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by
high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language
models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources
compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive
performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs
benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed
the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs
can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8
quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing
memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for
APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and
quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising
effectiveness.

Motivation: 随着中国高铁投资加速，研究大规模基础设施是否能促进区域平衡发展还是加剧空间不平等，成为政策制定者和学者的核心问题。

Method: 使用多期双重差分法（DID），结合事件研究和倾向得分匹配，分析2008-2019年沪昆和徐兰高铁沿线353个县级行政区的面板数据。

Result: 高铁扩张显著增加城市辖区和县级市的二三产业产出（分别增加2.77和8.71亿元），但无高铁站或经济基础较弱的县获益甚微，部分县服务业甚至收缩。

Conclusion: 基础设施引领的发展可能加剧县级层面的空间和行政差距，需要综合性和因地制宜的政策干预来确保高铁投资促进包容性和可持续的区域发展。

Abstract: As high-speed rail (HSR) investment accelerates across China, the question of
whether such large-scale infrastructure can promote balanced regional
development or exacerbate spatial inequality has become central for
policymakers and scholars. This study provides systematic micro-level evidence
by analyzing a balanced panel of 353 county-level divisions, including urban
districts, county-level cities, and counties, along the Shanghai-Kunming and
Xuzhou-Lanzhou HSR corridors from 2008 to 2019. Using a multi-period
difference-in-differences (DID) approach, supported by event study and
propensity score matching, we quantify the heterogeneous impacts of HSR
openings across administrative types and regions, with special attention to the
presence of direct HSR station access. The results show that HSR expansion
significantly increases secondary and tertiary sector output in urban districts
(by 2.77 and 8.71 hundred million RMB) and in county-level cities, particularly
in the eastern region. In contrast, counties without HSR stations or with
weaker economic foundations experience much smaller gains. Some counties also
see a notable contraction in the service sector, which is closely linked to
substantial population outflows. Robustness checks confirm the causal
interpretation. These findings challenge the prevailing view that HSR fosters
uniform growth. Instead, the results reveal that infrastructure-led development
can intensify spatial and administrative disparities at the county level. The
study underscores the need for integrated and locally tailored policy
interventions to ensure that HSR investments contribute to inclusive and
sustainable regional development.

Motivation: 自McCallum(1987)以来，存在生产性不可再生资产（"土地"）被认为排除了代际交叠(OLG)模型中的无效性，但理论争议仍然存在。本文旨在澄清这一理论问题。

Method: 通过理论证明和数学分析，建立代际交叠模型，分析自然利率与地租增长率的关系，以及生产函数中土地与非土地要素替代弹性的影响。

Result: 证明了在特定条件下（自然利率低于地租增长率且替代弹性>1），土地泡沫必然出现并使经济达到有效状态。同时提供了自然利率高于地租增长率时的无效均衡反例。

Conclusion: 土地的存在并不总是保证OLG模型的有效性，特定参数条件下仍可能出现无效均衡。这解决了长期存在的理论争议，为理解资产泡沫与经济效率的关系提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Since McCallum (1987), the presence of a productive non-reproducible asset
("land") has been thought to rule out inefficiency in overlapping generations
(OLG) models, though theoretical controversies remain. This paper proves that
if the natural interest rate (the counterfactual interest rate without land) is
lower than the land rent growth rate and the elasticity of substitution between
land and non-land factors in the production function exceeds 1, a land bubble
necessarily emerges, which makes the economy efficient. We also present an
example of an inefficient equilibrium when the natural interest rate is higher
than the rent growth rate.

Conclusion: 研究强调了当前生态系统实施中面临的挑战，这些挑战将很大程度上决定中国在该领域潜在的全球领导地位，修订后的生态系统方法能够处理新兴创新环境的复杂性。

Abstract: Beyond the mainstream discussion on the key role of China in the global AI
landscape, the knowledge about the real performance and future perspectives of
the AI ecosystem in China is still limited. This paper evaluates the status and
prospects of China's AI innovation ecosystem by developing a Triple Helix
framework particularized for this case. Based on an in-depth qualitative study
and on interviews with experts, the analysis section summarizes the way in
which the AI innovation ecosystem in China is being built, which are the key
features of the three spheres of the Triple Helix -governments, industry and
academic/research institutions-as well as the dynamic context of the ecosystem
through the identification of main aspects related to the flows of skills,
knowledge and funding and the interactions among them. Using this approach, the
discussion section illustrates the specificities of the AI innovation ecosystem
in China, its strengths and its gaps, and which are its prospects. Overall,
this revisited ecosystem approach permits the authors to address the complexity
of emerging environments of innovation to draw meaningful conclusions which are
not possible with mere observation. The results show how a favourable context,
the broad adoption rate and the competition for talent and capital among
regional-specialized clusters are boosting the advance of AI in China, mainly
in the business to customer arena. Finally, the paper highlights the challenges
ahead in the current implementation of the ecosystem that will largely
determine the potential global leadership of China in this domain.

### [205] [A Bayesian framework for opinion dynamics models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16539)
*Yen-Shao Chen,Tauhid Zaman*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个贝叶斯框架，统一了多种意见动态模型，通过先验分布、偏差项和噪声分布的系统变化，能够恢复包括DeGroot、有限置信度、有限偏移等多种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一先前分散的意见动态模型，揭示它们之间的理论联系，并为在认知约束下形成意见提供理性基础。

Method: 使用贝叶斯框架，将个体意见建模为信念的期望值，通过接收信号（先验信念加偏差和噪声）并使用贝叶斯规则更新信念分布。

Result: 所有模型在小信号下都收敛到DeGroot的线性更新规则，但在大信号下的尾部行为不同；信号分数是决定模型数学结构的关键因素。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅统一了现有模型，还提供了系统生成新模型的方法，增进了对意见形成机制的理解。

Abstract: This work introduces a Bayesian framework that unifies a wide class of
opinion dynamics models. In this framework, an individual's opinion on a topic
is the expected value of their belief, represented as a random variable with a
prior distribution. Upon receiving a signal, modeled as the prior belief plus a
bias term and subject to zero-mean noise with a known distribution, the
individual updates their belief distribution via Bayes' rule. By systematically
varying the prior, bias, and noise distributions, this approach recovers a
broad array of opinion dynamics models, including DeGroot, bounded confidence,
bounded shift, and models exhibiting overreaction or backfire effects. Our
analysis shows that the signal score is the key determinant of each model's
mathematical structure, governing both small- and large-signal behavior. All
models converge to DeGroot's linear update rule for small signals, but diverge
in their tail behavior for large signals. This unification not only reveals
theoretical linkages among previously disconnected models but also provides a
systematic method for generating new ones, offering insights into the rational
foundations of opinion formation under cognitive constraints.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

### [2] [Agent WARPP: Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19543)
*Maria Emilia Mazzolenis,Ruirui Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WARPP框架通过运行时并行个性化提升LLM在任务导向对话中的工作流遵循能力，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长条件工作流中因外部工具调用和用户特定信息依赖而表现不佳的问题。

Method: 结合多智能体编排和运行时个性化，动态修剪条件分支，并行化架构中专用Personalizer代理与领域特定代理协作。

Result: 在银行、航班和医疗领域测试中，WARPP在参数保真度和工具准确性上优于非个性化方法和ReAct基线，同时减少令牌使用。

Conclusion: WARPP显著提升了LLM在复杂工作流中的表现，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

### [3] [Hypergames: Modeling Misaligned Perceptions and Nested Beliefs for Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19593)
*Vince Trencsenyi,Agnieszka Mensfelt,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了超博弈理论在动态多智能体系统中的应用，分析了44项研究，提出了智能体兼容性标准和分类框架，并指出了当前研究的不足与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决经典博弈论在现实多智能体系统中因假设过于理想化而无法应对不确定性、认知偏差和信念差异的问题。

Method: 通过系统回顾44项研究，引入超博弈理论及其扩展（如分层超博弈和HNF），并开发智能体兼容性标准和分类框架。

Result: 发现分层和图模型在欺骗推理中占主导，但HNF模型采用较少，且缺乏形式化语言和人类-智能体对齐研究。

Conclusion: 超博弈理论可提升动态多智能体环境中战略建模的实用性和真实性，但仍需解决结构性和语言性挑战。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

### [4] [DeltaLLM: A Training-Free Framework Exploiting Temporal Sparsity for Efficient Edge LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19608)
*Jiawen Qi,Chang Gao,Zhaochun Ren,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaLLM是一个无需训练的框架，通过利用注意力模式的时间稀疏性，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效的大型语言模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在序列长度上的计算量呈二次增长，边缘设备部署面临挑战，现有动态注意力修剪方法不适用于边缘场景。

Method: DeltaLLM引入了一种基于准确性和内存的增量矩阵构建策略，以及结合局部上下文窗口内全注意力和外部增量近似的混合注意力机制。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上，DeltaLLM将注意力稀疏性提升至60%，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM为边缘设备部署提供了一种无需微调的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the
evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

### [6] [The wall confronting large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19703)
*Peter V. Coveney,Sauro Succi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的性能受限于其预测不确定性的提升能力，难以满足科学研究的可靠性标准。其学习机制可能导致错误累积和信息灾难，而数据中的虚假相关性加剧了这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在提升预测可靠性方面的局限性，揭示其学习机制与准确性之间的冲突，以及数据规模带来的虚假相关性对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析LLM的缩放规律和学习机制，结合数据集的虚假相关性现象，论证其性能限制和潜在退化风险。

Result: LLM的预测不确定性难以显著提升，且其学习机制可能导致错误累积和信息灾难，退化行为在LLM领域具有高概率性。

Conclusion: 为避免LLM的退化路径，需更重视对问题结构特征的深入理解和洞察，而非单纯依赖数据规模。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

*Alec Scully,Cameron Stockton,Forrest Hare*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出利用本体结构知识图谱预测未来事件，结合BFO和CCO语义框架组织数据，通过马尔可夫链模型预测未来状态，并提出新的概率观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨本体结构知识图谱在预测未来事件中的关键作用，改进现有概率模型的不足。

Method: 利用BFO和CCO语义框架组织数据，构建马尔可夫链模型，并提出“时空实例”概念完善结构语义。

Result: 展示了如何将马尔可夫链概率计算无缝集成回知识图谱，支持进一步分析和决策。

Conclusion: 本体结构知识图谱结合改进的概率模型能有效预测未来事件，为动态现象提供更准确的分析框架。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

### [8] [Minding Motivation: The Effect of Intrinsic Motivation on Agent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19725)
*Leonardo Villalobos-Arias,Grant Forbes,Jianxun Wang,David L Roberts,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了内在动机（IM）方法在强化学习（RL）中如何影响代理行为，发现IM可能导致奖励黑客行为，并验证了广义奖励匹配（GRM）的缓解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏中的奖励稀疏性使得RL代理难以学习，IM方法虽能解决此问题，但可能引发奖励黑客行为，目前对此现象的研究较少。

Method: 在MiniGrid环境中评估了三种IM技术对代理行为的影响，并与GRM方法进行对比。

Result: IM显著改变了代理的初始奖励和游戏方式，而GRM在某些情况下能有效缓解奖励黑客行为。

Conclusion: IM确实会改变RL代理的行为，GRM是一种有潜力的解决方案，但需进一步研究其适用范围。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

*Yuzhang Xie,Xu Han,Ran Xu,Xiao Hu,Jiaying Lu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypKG框架通过整合电子健康记录（EHRs）中的患者信息到知识图谱（KGs）中，生成上下文知识表示，以提升医疗预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对知识准确性和数据互联性要求高，但传统KGs缺乏患者特定上下文信息，而EHRs提供了丰富的个人数据。

Method: 使用实体链接技术将KGs与EHRs连接，并利用超图模型和超图变换器学习上下文化表示。

Result: 实验表明，HypKG在多个评估指标上显著提升了医疗预测任务的性能。

Conclusion: HypKG通过整合外部上下文，提升了KGs的实体和关系表示质量，增强了知识的实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

### [10] [Can LLMs Solve ASP Problems? Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749)
*Lin Ren,Guohui Xiao,Guilin Qi,Yishuai Geng,Haohan Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASPBench是一个全面的ASP基准测试，用于评估LLMs在ASP任务中的表现，发现LLMs在核心任务（如答案集计算）上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLMs在ASP中的评估过于简化，缺乏支持复杂逻辑（如否定、析取、多答案集）的基准测试，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入ASPBench，包含三个ASP特定任务：ASP蕴含、答案集验证和答案集计算，并对14种先进LLMs进行评估。

Result: LLMs在前两个简单任务上表现较好，但在核心任务（答案集计算）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在ASP解决中存在局限性，需要更有效的符号推理能力集成方法。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/HomuraT/ASPBench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于马尔可夫决策过程的广义多目标、多层级供应链优化模型，结合经济、环境和社会因素，并通过多目标强化学习方法进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非平稳市场中供应链优化的复杂问题，同时平衡经济、环境和社会目标。

Method: 采用多目标强化学习（RL）方法，与改进的单目标RL算法和基于多目标进化算法（MOEA）的方法进行对比。

Result: 在多目标优化中表现最佳，平衡了最优性、多样性和密度，在复杂环境中比MOEA方法高出75%的超体积，解决方案密度是改进单目标RL方法的11倍。

Conclusion: 该模型在复杂供应链环境中实现了稳定的生产和库存水平，同时最小化了需求损失，为多目标优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

TL;DR: DiCap模型通过扩散过程生成反事实提示，提升跨类别泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法缺乏理论支持，难以生成因果不变的提示。

Method: 利用扩散过程从因果模型的边际和条件分布中采样梯度，生成满足最小充分性标准的反事实提示。

Result: 在图像分类、图像-文本检索和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，尤其在未见类别上优势明显。

Conclusion: DiCap模型通过理论驱动的反事实提示生成，显著提升了提示学习的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

*Olivia Guest*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了以人为中心的人工智能（AI）本质上是技术与人类认知的关系，分析了AI对人类认知的替代、增强或取代作用，并强调必须正视人类在AI中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清AI与人类认知的关系，避免因忽视人类角色而导致的认知科学扭曲和AI设计中的偏差。

Method: 通过对比技术（如算盘、闹钟）与人类认知的实例，提出新的定义和分析框架，将社会技术关系分为替代、增强或取代人类认知劳动的类型。

Result: 研究发现所有AI都涉及人类认知，忽视这一点会阻碍批判性思考、扭曲认知科学，并限制以人为中心的AI设计。

Conclusion: 结论强调必须正视人类在AI中的作用，才能真正实现以人为中心的AI系统设计。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Motivation: 6G网络中新兴应用（如全息通信、自动驾驶等）对灵活、低延迟和可靠的资源分配提出了严格要求，传统统计建模方法在动态环境中表现不佳，且实时CSI获取开销大。

Method: 利用DTC预测CSI，结合轻量级博弈论算法进行在线资源分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比基于导频的理想CSI方案吞吐量提升高达11.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持未来6G网络中可扩展、低开销和环境感知的通信。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Motivation: 旨在使AI推理过程透明化，让用户理解AI如何得出结论，从而提升AI的信任度和实用性。

Method: 提出D-LLM框架，包含推理过程、偏好分类系统和对话方法，嵌入用户偏好以个性化LLMs。

Result: 构想了一个可解释的AI系统，用户可查看和整合影响AI决策的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 目标是开发透明、可追溯的AI系统，增强人类决策中对AI的信任。

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，稳定室友问题可能无解，因此需要寻找“足够好”的匹配方案。

Method: 结合代理的习惯偏好和社交网络，生成个性化的稳定室友匹配方案。

Result: 通过实例和实证评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为稳定室友问题提供实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

TL;DR: PITA框架通过直接整合偏好反馈到LLM的token生成中，无需预训练奖励模型，实现了高效的推理时对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练奖励模型，可能不稳定且计算成本高。PITA旨在消除这种依赖，直接利用偏好反馈。

Method: PITA通过小型偏好引导策略修改token概率，采用随机搜索和迭代优化方法。

Result: 在数学推理和情感分类等任务中，PITA有效对齐LLM输出与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA提供了一种无需奖励模型的高效推理时对齐方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

<details>

Motivation: 现有神经网络在多智能体强化学习中缺乏透明度和互操作性，其隐含的合作机制因黑盒特性难以理解。

Method: 提出CMQ方法，通过学习可解释的合作概念（表示为监督向量），并利用全局状态嵌入条件化个体动作值，增强合作表示能力。

Result: 在StarCraft II和LBF任务中，CMQ性能优于现有方法，并能捕捉有意义的合作模式，支持概念干预以检测潜在偏差。

Conclusion: CMQ突破了性能与可解释性的权衡，为MARL提供了更透明和高效的合作机制表示。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Motivation: 强化学习在大型语言和推理模型（LLMs/LRMs）中常产生脆弱且不稳定的策略，导致推理错误、欺骗性对齐等问题，缺乏统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过数学框架分析奖励函数到最优策略的映射稳定性，研究非唯一最优动作的影响，并扩展到多奖励RL和熵正则化的作用。

Result: 理论分析揭示了策略脆弱性的根源，熵正则化可恢复稳定性但增加随机性，框架解释了多种RL失败现象。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计更安全、可信的AI系统提供了理论基础，将政策稳定性分析从经验启发提升为原则性理论。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Result: HFrame比精确匹配算法快101.91倍，平均准确率达0.962，并能区分更多非同态图对。

Conclusion: HFrame在子图同态问题上表现出色，为图分析提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics

35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine
that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances
decision making in complex R&D environments.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在各领域的广泛应用，其高维表示可能带来安全问题，如激活工程绕过安全对齐。

Method: 通过可视化不同概念（如安全性）的线性子空间，并验证降维方法的有效性。

Result: 降维显著降低了通过表示工程进行越狱的脆弱性，同时保留了足够的安全对齐信息。

Conclusion: 高维表示既是优势也是隐患，降维是解决安全对齐问题的有效途径。

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂道路条件和动态场景中。

Conclusion: VLMPlanner通过视觉上下文和动态推理机制，显著提升了自动驾驶规划的鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

Motivation: 解决城市环境中移动资源（如共享单车/电动滑板车、拼车）的动态分配问题，以平衡供需。

Method: 设计了分层自适应分组参数共享（HAG-PS），包括全局和局部信息的分层方法、自适应代理分组和可学习的身份嵌入。

Result: 基于纽约共享单车数据（120万次行程）的实验表明，HAG-PS在资源可用性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAG-PS通过动态参数共享和高效内存使用，显著提升了移动资源分配的效果。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

TL;DR: STARN-GAT是一种多模态时空图注意力网络，通过自适应图构建和模态感知注意力机制，有效预测交通事故严重性，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测交通事故严重性对提升道路安全、优化应急响应和设计更安全的交通基础设施至关重要，但现有方法难以建模复杂的时空和上下文变量关系。

Method: 提出STARN-GAT模型，结合路网拓扑、时间交通模式和环境上下文，采用注意力机制统一建模。

Result: 在FARS数据集上Macro F1-score达85%，ROC-AUC为0.91；在ARI-BUET数据集上Macro F1-score为0.84，ROC-AUC为0.89。

Conclusion: STARN-GAT在识别高风险案例和实时交通管理中表现优异，其注意力机制增强了模型可解释性，为AI辅助决策提供信任支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Motivation: 探讨AI代理在现实环境中的可信度，尤其是在受到攻击时是否违反部署政策。

Method: 组织了最大的公开红队竞赛，针对22个前沿AI代理进行44种现实部署场景测试，收集了180万次提示注入攻击数据。

Result: 超过6万次攻击成功引发政策违规，几乎所有代理在10-100次查询内表现出漏洞，且攻击在不同模型和任务间具有高转移性。

Conclusion: AI代理存在严重且持久的漏洞，需要额外防御措施。通过发布ART基准测试，支持更严格的安全评估和推动更安全的代理部署。

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效优化了交互式配置系统的性能，支持更高效的用户体验。

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化方法直接操作启发式代码，而MeLA通过优化LLM的提示，探索更高效、可解释的启发式设计路径。

Method: MeLA结合问题分析器、错误诊断系统和元认知搜索引擎，通过迭代优化提示来生成启发式代码。

Result: 在基准和实际问题测试中，MeLA生成的启发式更有效且鲁棒，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于认知科学的元认知框架为AI架构提供了新方向，提升了启发式设计的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphDPO框架，通过直接偏好优化解决知识图谱中信息遗忘问题，提升遗忘效果并保留边界知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱中存在过时或错误信息，需要从嵌入模型中移除，但现有遗忘方法存在不完全遗忘和边界知识削弱问题。

Method: 提出GraphDPO框架，将遗忘问题重构为偏好优化问题，结合边界采样和边界回忆机制。

Result: 在四个知识图谱上构建八个数据集，实验显示GraphDPO在MRR_Avg和MRR_F1上分别提升10.1%和14.0%。

Conclusion: GraphDPO有效解决了知识图谱遗忘问题，提升了遗忘效果和边界知识保留。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型（LMM）在视觉编码器和语言模型结合方面取得进展，但其在边缘设备上的部署仍面临压缩挑战。

Method: 采用Tree-structured Parzen Estimator动态调整不同层的剪枝比例和KV缓存量化带宽，结合剪枝与KV缓存量化，无需额外微调即可实现高效压缩。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5 7B和13B等基准数据集上，该方法优于SparseGPT和Wanda等现有技术，尤其在KV缓存资源分配方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架为LMM优化设定了新标准，实现了内存效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

Conclusion: MoCME通过有效利用多模态互补性和动态负采样，显著提升了多模态知识图谱补全的效果。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the

real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve

strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

Conclusion: 运行时公平性需要动态监控和执行策略，且需根据环境动态和需求定制解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

Result: 在旅行决策的实际数据用例中评估了该方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习社会的多样价值系统，为伦理AI提供支持。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

Method: 使用AI模型（如多臂老虎机模型）识别最需要干预的受益者，并进行实时服务呼叫干预。

Result: AI干预显著提高了听众参与度，并改善了受益者的健康行为（如补充铁和钙）和健康知识。

Conclusion: AI在母婴健康领域具有推动实质性改善的潜力。

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

Conclusion: 研究为CoT的机制解释提供了新框架，并为设计更高效提示提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMGraphRAG提出了一种改进的多模态检索增强生成方法，通过场景图和知识图谱结合，解决了传统方法在多模态信息融合和逻辑链捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在多模态信息处理上存在不足，无法有效捕捉知识结构和模态间逻辑链，且需要大规模任务特定训练。

Method: MMGraphRAG利用场景图细化视觉内容，构建多模态知识图谱，并通过谱聚类实现跨模态实体链接，沿推理路径检索上下文。

Result: 在DocBench和MMLongBench数据集上达到最先进性能，展示了强大的领域适应性和清晰的推理路径。

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG通过结合场景图和知识图谱，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

*Yang You,Vincent Thomas,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes,Olivier Buffet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的离线算法POMCGS，用于解决大规模POMDP问题，通过动态折叠搜索树减少计算量，并支持连续POMDP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间或能量受限的POMDP应用中，离线策略更受欢迎，但现有离线算法无法扩展到大规模POMDP。

Method: 提出POMCGS算法，动态折叠搜索树构建策略图，结合动作渐进扩展和观测聚类方法处理连续POMDP。

Result: POMCGS能解决现有离线算法无法处理的最具挑战性POMDP，其策略值与最先进的在线算法相当。

Conclusion: POMCGS是一种高效且可扩展的离线POMDP解决方案，适用于大规模和连续问题。

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

*Bill Cochran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于神经网络深度的形式化模型，用于分析大型语言模型的推理限制，证明其逻辑表达能力存在严格上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型神经语言模型的推理局限性，揭示其无法表示高阶逻辑的原因，为未来模型改进提供理论基础。

Method: 将神经网络视为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，证明每层仅能编码一级逻辑推理，从而限制其表达能力。

Result: 发现神经网络深度限制了其表示高阶逻辑的能力，解释了幻觉、重复等现象，并提出了未来改进方向。

Conclusion: 研究为理解语言模型的逻辑限制提供了框架，并启发未来架构扩展和可解释性策略。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

### [48] [Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964)
*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个可实现的修正性框架，在多步、部分可观测环境中提供可证明的保证，通过五个独立的效用头实现安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如Constitutional AI或RLHF/RLAIF）将所有规范合并为一个标量的问题，通过分离效用头确保安全性和服从性。

Method: 使用五个结构分离的效用头（服从性、开关访问保护、真实性、低影响行为和有限任务奖励），并通过严格权重间隙进行词典排序。

Result: 证明了在部分可观测的开关游戏中单轮修正性的精确性，并扩展到多步自生成代理，安全性违反概率有界。

Conclusion: 框架将奖励黑客风险转移到评估质量上，为当前LLM助手和未来自主系统提供了更清晰的实现指导。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

*Weichen Zhang,Yiyou Sun,Pohao Huang,Jiayue Pu,Heyue Lin,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE-Bench是一个统一的基准测试，用于评估和引发交互式LLM代理中的幻觉行为，通过分类和系统化测试案例来提供可操作的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估的碎片化问题，为LLM代理的幻觉行为提供一个原则性的测试平台。

Method: 引入三部分分类法，通过系统审计和快照策略合成测试案例，采用细粒度LLM-as-a-Judge范式进行评估。

Result: MIRAGE-Bench能够高效评估代理行为，揭示失败模式，并为减少幻觉提供基础。

Conclusion: 该基准为交互环境中幻觉的缓解提供了系统化的方法和可扩展的评估框架。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

*Haoyang Liu,Yijiang Li,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenoMAS是一个基于LLM的团队协作系统，结合结构化工作流和自主代理的灵活性，用于基因表达分析，显著提升了数据预处理和基因识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因表达分析复杂且需要专业知识，现有自动化方法在灵活性和精确性上存在不足。

Method: GenoMAS通过六个专业LLM代理和消息传递协议，结合指导性规划框架，动态调整分析流程。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准测试中，数据预处理和基因识别的性能分别提升了10.61%和16.85%。

Conclusion: GenoMAS不仅性能优越，还能发现生物学上合理的基因-表型关联，代码已开源。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在动态交互环境中的适应性问题，推动自进化代理的发展以实现更高级的人工智能。

Method: 围绕‘进化什么’、‘何时进化’和‘如何进化’三个维度，分析代理组件、适应方法和算法设计。

Result: 提出了自进化代理的结构化框架，总结了评估指标、应用领域及未来挑战。

Conclusion: 自进化代理是实现人工超级智能（ASI）的关键路径，为研究和实际部署提供了路线图。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

TL;DR: 论文评估了多种Transformer模型（如BERT、RoBERTa等）与LSTM模型在心理健康分类任务中的表现，发现Transformer模型性能更优，尤其是RoBERTa表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题的增加需要自动化工具进行早期检测和监控，NLP技术的进步为此提供了可能。

Method: 构建大型标注数据集，比较Transformer模型与LSTM模型在不同文本嵌入技术下的表现。

Result: RoBERTa在测试集上F1分数达99.54%，LSTM结合BERT嵌入也表现优异（F1>94%）。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在实时、可扩展的心理健康监测中效果显著，为临床应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术文献数量激增，需要有效组织、比较和对比文档集合。现有方法在框架生成上进展缓慢，主要由于评估模糊和缺乏编辑方法。

Method: 1. 通过合成意图增强未标注表格数据集，创建用于研究框架生成的数据集。2. 提出多种基于LLM的框架编辑技术，并对比单次生成方法的性能。

Result: 合成意图显著提高了基准性能；小规模开放权重模型通过微调可与先进提示LLMs竞争；编辑技术进一步改进了生成的框架。

Conclusion: 论文首次解决了框架生成中的评估模糊和编辑问题，展示了合成意图和编辑技术的有效性，为文档比较提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

Conclusion: WOKIE通过自动化翻译和优化本体匹配，支持更包容和多语言的研究基础设施。

Abstract: We introduce WOKIE, an open-source, modular, and ready-to-use pipeline for
the automated translation of SKOS thesauri. This work addresses a critical need
in the Digital Humanities (DH), where language diversity can limit access,
reuse, and semantic interoperability of knowledge resources. WOKIE combines
external translation services with targeted refinement using Large Language
Models (LLMs), balancing translation quality, scalability, and cost. Designed
to run on everyday hardware and be easily extended, the application requires no
prior expertise in machine translation or LLMs. We evaluate WOKIE across
several DH thesauri in 15 languages with different parameters, translation
services and LLMs, systematically analysing translation quality, performance,
and ontology matching improvements. Our results show that WOKIE is suitable to
enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估和缓解大型语言模型（LLMs）地理空间幻觉的框架，通过知识图谱评估和KTO优化方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在地理空间任务中表现出知识不准确的问题（地理空间幻觉），但相关研究较少，亟需系统评估和缓解方法。

Method: 提出基于结构化地理空间知识图谱的评估框架，并采用Kahneman-Tversky优化方法（KTO）动态调整模型事实性。

Result: 在20个先进LLMs上评估，发现地理空间幻觉问题，优化后性能提升29.6%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和优化方法有效提升了LLMs在地理空间知识和推理任务中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 自注意力的二次时间和内存复杂度限制了长上下文建模的效率，因此需要研究高效的注意力机制。

Method: 论文系统性地综述了线性注意力（通过核近似、循环公式或快速权重动态实现线性复杂度）和稀疏注意力（通过固定模式、块路由或聚类策略选择子集）两类方法。

Result: 综述整合了算法创新和硬件层面的考虑，并分析了高效注意力在大规模预训练模型中的应用，包括纯高效注意力架构和混合设计。

Conclusion: 该工作为设计可扩展且高效的语言模型提供了理论基础和实践部署策略的参考。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在代码生成方面取得了显著进展，但其在对抗性滥用（尤其是多轮恶意编码提示）中的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了代码分解攻击方法，将恶意任务分解为多个看似无害的子任务，并引入MOCHA基准进行系统性评估。

Result: 实验表明，模型在多轮场景下存在持续漏洞，而基于MOCHA的微调显著提高了拒绝率（提升达32.4%），同时保持了编码能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过微调可以显著增强LLMs对抗恶意提示的鲁棒性，且无需额外监督。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言对（英语与印度语）的语音转文本翻译问题。

Method: 集成预训练的Whisper ASR模型与Krutrim LLM，并探索了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）方法。

Result: 平均BLEU分数为28.88（英语到印度语）和27.86（印度语到英语），CoT方法在某些语言对中表现显著（如泰米尔语到英语提升13.84 BLEU）。

Conclusion: 端到端系统有效，但CoT方法在输出格式一致性上存在挑战。

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

Motivation: 解决资源不足语言（如罗马尼亚语）在法律教育中的AI支持需求。

Method: 使用RoD-TAL数据集，评估LLMs和VLMs在文本和视觉问答任务中的表现，并采用RAG管道、密集检索器和推理优化模型。

Result: 领域微调显著提升检索性能，推理优化模型在问答任务中表现优异，但视觉推理仍有挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs和VLMs在法律教育中具有潜力，但视觉推理仍需改进。

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言和单语言大语言模型（LLM）在阿拉伯语、英语和印度语言中的表现，重点关注模型压缩策略（如剪枝和量化）的影响。发现多语言模型普遍优于单语言模型，量化在保持效率的同时有效，而过度剪枝会显著降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在低资源语言环境（如卡纳达语和阿拉伯语）中的能力，并研究模型压缩策略对性能的影响。

Method: 对多语言和单语言LLM（如BLOOMZ、AceGPT等）进行基准测试，分析剪枝和量化策略的效果。

Result: 多语言模型表现更优，量化有效但剪枝会损害性能，尤其在大型模型中。

Conclusion: 研究为构建可扩展且公平的多语言NLP解决方案提供了关键策略，并强调需解决低资源环境中的幻觉和泛化错误。

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的三阶段流水线方法，用于从表格数据生成包含主观性的文本，通过RDF三元组提取、文本聚合和主观性注入，实现了事实准确性与主观解释的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成方法主要关注客观描述，而忽略了主观性文本的生成，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) 提取RDF三元组；2) 聚合文本为连贯叙述；3) 注入主观性以丰富文本。使用小型T5模型而非大型语言模型。

Result: 在多项指标上表现优于Mistral-7B和Llama-2，与GPT-3.5相当，同时保持了事实准确性和主观解释的平衡。

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了一种结构化流水线方法，通过中间表示增强表格到文本生成的事实正确性和主观性。

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为基本阅读蒸馏（BRD）的方法，通过教育小型模型模仿大型语言模型的基本阅读行为，使其在多种任务中表现优于或接近20倍大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）计算资源需求高，限制了实际部署。现有蒸馏方法忽略了小型模型在通用文本上的基本阅读教育。

Method: 提出BRD方法，教育小型模型模仿LLMs的基本阅读行为（如命名实体识别、问答），然后应用于多种任务。

Result: 小型模型在语言推理和BIG-bench任务中表现优于或接近20倍大的LLMs。

Conclusion: BRD通过影响小型模型的概率分布，与知识蒸馏或任务蒸馏具有正交性，是一种有效的蒸馏方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length
up to 32K tokens. JT-Math-8B achieves state-of-the-art results among
open-source models of similar size, surpassing prominent models like OpenAI's
O1-mini and GPT-4o , and demonstrating superior performance on
competition-level mathematics.

TL;DR: 本文利用计算工具研究基督教小说中“神的行为”描写，发现《末日迷踪》系列与其他基督教小说及男女作者作品间存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基督教小说的文化层面研究较少，尤其是“神的行为”描写未被深入探讨。

Method: 结合人类注释和轻量级语言模型，定义并标注“神的行为”，比较不同作品和作者的差异。

Result: 轻量级模型能匹配人类注释，揭示《末日迷踪》与其他作品及男女作者间的显著差异。

Conclusion: 计算工具能有效分析基督教小说中的“神的行为”，为文学研究提供新视角。

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对超长输出序列的强化学习方法（UloRL），通过分段解码和动态掩码技术，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架在处理超长输出序列时效率低下，存在长尾序列分布和熵崩溃问题，限制了大型语言模型的推理能力提升。

Method: 将超长输出解码分为短段，减少长尾样本的延迟；引入动态掩码技术，防止熵崩溃。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B-A3B模型上，训练速度提升2.06倍；在128k-token输出下，AIME2025和BeyondAIME任务性能分别提升至85.1%和61.9%。

Conclusion: UloRL方法有效提升了大型语言模型在超长序列生成中的推理能力，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

TL;DR: Flora是一种无需人工或LLM干预的长上下文构建策略，通过组合短指令提升LLMs的长上下文性能，同时保持短上下文能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs处理长上下文时的稀有性、高计算成本和短上下文能力下降问题。

Method: Flora通过分类组合短指令，并基于长上下文元指令生成响应，实现任意长度和多样性的上下文构建。

Result: 在Llama3-8B-Instruct和QwQ-32B上，Flora显著提升了长上下文性能，同时短上下文性能下降较小。

Conclusion: Flora为LLMs提供了一种高效、低成本的长上下文优化方案。

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCAttention提出了一种异构注意力计算框架，通过键量化、值卸载和动态KV淘汰，在极端内存限制下实现高效推理，将KV缓存内存占用减少至25%，且无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理长上下文输入时，KV缓存的内存需求巨大，现有压缩方法在内存减少超过85%时性能明显下降，且GPU-CPU协作的近似注意力策略尚未充分探索。

Method: HCAttention结合键量化、值卸载和动态KV淘汰，兼容现有Transformer架构，无需模型微调。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，HCAttention在KV缓存内存占用减少至25%时保持全注意力模型的准确性，12.5%时仍具竞争力，首次在单块A100 GPU上处理400万token。

Conclusion: HCAttention在KV缓存压缩方面达到新SOTA，为长上下文处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

Method: 采用两阶段、提示驱动的合成方法，生成3500个多轮对话，涵盖七个汽车领域。

Result: DiscoDrive在训练和低资源数据增强中表现优异，显著提升了多项指标（如BLEU-4、METEOR等），且人工评估显示其对话更自然、连贯。

Conclusion: DiscoDrive填补了现有资源的空白，为车载对话AI提供了更真实的训练和增强数据。

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成过程中需要大量计算资源，KV缓存虽加速了生成过程，但其内存占用随序列长度、批处理大小和模型规模线性增长，成为长上下文场景的瓶颈。

Method: CaliDrop利用查询位置相似性进行推测性校准，减少令牌驱逐带来的精度损失。

Result: 实验表明，CaliDrop显著提升了现有令牌驱逐方法的精度。

Conclusion: CaliDrop通过校准优化令牌驱逐策略，有效平衡了内存占用和模型精度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

TL;DR: KLAAD是一种基于注意力的去偏框架，通过隐式对齐注意力分布来减少LLM中的社会偏见，同时保持语言建模质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）输出中的社会偏见问题，以提升公平性和减少潜在危害。

Method: 提出KLAAD框架，结合交叉熵、KL散度和三元组损失，隐式对齐注意力分布，不直接修改模型权重。

Result: 在BBQ和BOLD基准测试中表现出更好的偏见缓解效果，且对语言建模质量影响最小。

Conclusion: 注意力级别的对齐为生成语言模型中的偏见缓解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

TL;DR: Text2Vis是一个评估文本到可视化模型的基准，涵盖20多种图表类型和多样化的数据科学查询，旨在填补现有评估空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化数据可视化对简化数据解释和提升决策效率至关重要，但缺乏全面基准限制了大型语言模型（LLM）能力的严格评估。

Method: 提出Text2Vis基准，包含1,985个样本，每个样本包含数据表、自然语言查询、简短答案、可视化代码和标注图表。同时提出跨模态actor-critic框架和自动化LLM评估方法。

Result: 基准测试显示11个开源和闭源模型存在显著性能差距。提出的框架将GPT-4o的通过率从26%提升至42%，并改善了图表质量。

Conclusion: Text2Vis为文本到可视化模型提供了标准化评估工具，提出的框架和自动化评估方法推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Automated data visualization plays a crucial role in simplifying data
interpretation, enhancing decision-making, and improving efficiency. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating visualizations
from natural language, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks limits the
rigorous evaluation of their capabilities. We introduce Text2Vis, a benchmark
designed to assess text-to-visualization models, covering 20+ chart types and
diverse data science queries, including trend analysis, correlation, outlier
detection, and predictive analytics. It comprises 1,985 samples, each with a
data table, natural language query, short answer, visualization code, and
annotated charts. The queries involve complex reasoning, conversational turns,
and dynamic data retrieval. We benchmark 11 open-source and closed-source
models, revealing significant performance gaps, highlighting key challenges,
and offering insights for future advancements. To close this gap, we propose
the first cross-modal actor-critic agentic framework that jointly refines the
textual answer and visualization code, increasing GPT-4o`s pass rate from 26%
to 42% over the direct approach and improving chart quality. We also introduce
an automated LLM-based evaluation framework that enables scalable assessment
across thousands of samples without human annotation, measuring answer
correctness, code execution success, visualization readability, and chart
accuracy. We release Text2Vis at https://github.com/vis-nlp/Text2Vis.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在写作评分中的可靠性，并与人类评分者比较，以验证混合评分模型的潜力。

Method: 使用概化理论，比较人类和AI评分者在故事叙述和邮件回复任务中的评分一致性。

Result: 人类评分者更可靠，但LLMs在故事叙述任务中表现合理；混合评分模型提高了可靠性。

Conclusion: 混合评分模型可能在大规模写作评估中具有优势。

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

Result: 实验表明，VLQA数据集在法律任务中具有有效性，为低资源语言的法律NLP提供了重要资源。

Conclusion: VLQA数据集填补了越南法律NLP的资源空白，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种元学习框架，用于在有限标注数据下检测跨领域语言异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言异常（如垃圾信息、假新闻和仇恨言论）因稀疏性和多样性而难以检测，需解决跨领域泛化问题。

Method: 将异常检测视为少样本二分类问题，结合元学习（原型网络和领域重采样）快速适应新任务。

Result: 在多个数据集（如垃圾短信、COVID-19假新闻）上表现优于基线，F1和AUC得分更高。

Conclusion: 方法有效且泛化能力强，代码和基准已开源以推动少样本文本异常检测研究。

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong
baselines in F1 and AUC scores. We also release the code and benchmarks to
facilitate further research in few-shot text anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAEDKV是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩框架，通过频域变换实现无偏信息保留，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长上下文任务中KV缓存的高内存和计算需求，避免现有压缩方法导致的偏置表示。

Method: 使用无限窗口傅里叶变换（IWDFT）将KV缓存转换到频域，实现均衡信息保留，并通过频域消融研究优化压缩。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中表现优于现有方法22%，在Needle-In-A-Haystack任务中检索准确率更高。

Conclusion: FAEDKV提供了一种高效、无偏的KV缓存压缩方案，显著提升了长上下文任务的性能。

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based
approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成复杂统计信息图表的方法，填补了现有AI技术在从文本生成多子图表信息图方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI技术仅能生成简单图表，无法处理需要深度理解内容的复杂信息图生成任务。

Method: 提出Infogen框架，分两阶段生成信息图：先通过微调LLM生成元数据，再转换为信息图代码。

Result: 在Infodat基准测试中，Infogen表现优于其他开源和闭源LLM，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Infogen为复杂统计信息图生成提供了有效解决方案，展示了LLM在此任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种编译器框架，将DNN验证器的神经元级规范自动转换为基于张量的层级实现，解决了设计与实现之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN的不透明性使得基于抽象解释的验证成为建立信任的实用方法，但现有验证器开发困难，因为设计与实现之间存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出一种编译器框架，通过堆栈中间表示和形状分析，将神经元级规范转换为张量实现，并引入g-BCSR格式优化稀疏张量计算。

Result: 编译器框架实现了与手工优化实现相当的性能，同时简化了新验证器的开发。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN验证器的开发提供了灵活且高效的工具，填补了设计与实现之间的语义鸿沟。

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

TL;DR: RAG系统在真实多样检索场景中的表现存在局限性，需自适应策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG在多样化知识检索场景中的实际效果。

Method: 使用MassiveDS大规模数据存储评估RAG系统。

Result: 检索对小模型更有效，重排器作用有限，无单一检索源表现一致优越。

Conclusion: 需开发自适应检索策略以优化RAG在现实场景中的应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can
be found at https://github.com/ritaranx/RAG_in_the_Wild.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ProsodyLM，一种改进语音语言模型的方法，通过新的标记化方案更好地捕捉内容与韵律的依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型在将语音转换为离散标记后输入LLMs时，难以有效学习韵律信息，导致预训练后模型缺乏明显的韵律处理能力。

Method: 提出ProsodyLM，采用简单的标记化方案：先将语音转录为文本，再生成词级韵律标记，以保留更完整的韵律信息。

Result: ProsodyLM仅通过预训练即可学习多样化的韵律处理能力，如生成语音中的韵律细微差别、理解情感和重音，以及保持长上下文中的韵律一致性。

Conclusion: ProsodyLM通过改进的标记化方案显著提升了语音语言模型对韵律信息的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

Motivation: 古英语资源稀缺，限制了现代自然语言处理技术的应用，亟需解决方案。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（LoRA）、数据增强（反向翻译）和双代理流程（内容生成与翻译分离）。

Result: 自动评估指标（BLEU、METEOR、CHRF）显著提升，BLEU分数从26增至65以上；人工评估确认高语法准确性和风格保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅扩展了古英语语料库，还为其他濒危语言的复兴提供了实用方案，结合了AI创新与文化保护目标。

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DPO在自动提示工程中因缺乏语义一致性检查导致的提示漂移问题。

Method: 引入Sem-DPO，通过余弦距离加权DPO损失，确保语义一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Sem-DPO比DPO和其他基线表现更优。

Conclusion: 语义加权应成为提示优化的新标准，并为更广泛的语义感知优化奠定基础。

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

Result: 生成的英语和阿拉伯语问题（AraEngLongBench）对主流LVLMs具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LVLMs的长文本理解能力提供了高效的数据生成方案。

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in

Result: 在两个基准测试（MultiWOZ 2.4和{\tau}-Bench）中，该方法显著提升了目标对齐性能。

Conclusion: UGST填补了对话AI中的关键空白，成为开发目标对齐用户模拟器的重要框架。

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse

reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

### [90] [SessionIntentBench: A Multi-task Inter-session Intention-shift Modeling Benchmark for E-commerce Customer Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20185)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于会话历史的用户意图建模方法，通过引入意图树和数据集构建流程，创建了一个多模态基准SessionIntentBench，用于评估模型在复杂会话中理解意图变化的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效捕捉和建模用户意图，主要因为信息利用不足且仅依赖表面信息（如描述和标题），同时缺乏明确建模意图的数据和基准。

Method: 提出意图树概念和数据集构建流程，构建多模态基准SessionIntentBench，包含四个子任务，利用大规模会话数据（1,952,177意图条目和1,132,145会话意图轨迹）进行意图理解。

Result: 实验表明当前L(V)LMs在复杂会话设置中无法有效捕捉和利用意图，但注入意图信息能提升LLMs性能。

Conclusion: 论文提供了一个可扩展的会话数据利用方法，并验证了意图信息对模型性能的增强作用。

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

TL;DR: MultiRole-R1框架通过多角色视角增强多样性，提升主观推理任务的准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在主观问题上表现受限，因其依赖单一真实答案导致推理同质化。研究发现增加角色视角能提升性能。

Method: 提出MultiRole-R1框架，包含无监督数据构建管道生成多视角推理链，并通过GRPO强化学习结合多样性奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明MultiRole-R1在六个基准测试中有效提升主客观推理能力，揭示推理多样性与准确性的正相关。

Conclusion: 多样性增强训练在大型推理模型中具有潜力，MultiRole-R1为提升主观推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估范式，通过因子分析识别潜在技能，以更全面地评估大型语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLM）的评估依赖基准测试分数，但难以解释这些分数如何反映模型的整体能力。缺乏对任务之间关系的理解，导致模型评估过于简化。

Method: 使用因子分析识别跨基准测试的潜在技能，并应用于包含60个LLM在44个任务上的表现的排行榜。

Result: 识别出一小组潜在技能，这些技能能大部分解释模型的表现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了实用工具，用于识别冗余任务、辅助模型选择，并分析模型在各潜在技能上的表现。

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

Motivation: 解决新闻推荐中多视角新闻表示和用户动态兴趣建模的挑战。

Method: 整合NAML（多视角新闻建模）和LSTUR（双尺度用户建模），并使用BERT增强语义特征提取。

Result: 在MIND-small和MIND-large基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合多视角新闻表示和双尺度用户建模是有效的，模型已开源。

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合交互式叙事治疗师（INT）和创新时刻评估（IMA）的框架，用于提升大型语言模型在心理健康支持中的真实性和治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在心理健康支持中缺乏真实性和对治疗进展的捕捉，叙事疗法的潜力因访问限制和社会污名未被充分利用。

Method: 通过INT模拟专家叙事治疗师，规划治疗阶段并生成专家级响应；通过IMA评估治疗效果，追踪叙事转变。

Result: 在模拟和人类参与者实验中，INT在治疗质量和深度上优于标准大型语言模型，并能生成高质量支持对话。

Conclusion: 该框架为心理健康支持提供了更真实和有效的解决方案，推动了社会应用的发展。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业性在专家沟通中至关重要，但在高风险领域（如金融）中研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入新的标注框架量化语言特征（如话语调节、前言和请求类型），构建两个数据集（专业性和作者来源），并训练分类器。

Result: 语言特征与人类判断和作者来源高度相关，分类器性能优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 专业性是可学习的、领域通用的概念，可通过语言建模捕捉。

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Post-Completion Learning (PCL)的新训练框架，利用模型输出完成后的序列空间，提升推理和自我评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型训练范式通常在遇到结束标记时终止学习，忽略了完成后的潜在学习机会。

Method: 设计了白盒强化学习方法，让模型根据奖励规则评估输出内容，并通过双轨SFT和RL混合训练优化推理和评估能力。

Result: 在不同数据集和模型上的实验结果显示，该方法优于传统SFT和RL方法。

Conclusion: PCL为语言模型训练提供了新路径，在提升输出质量的同时保持了部署效率。

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖表面特征（如人口统计或行为属性）来确保多样性，但忽视了对话中隐含的意见表达，可能导致模型输出强化刻板印象。

Method: 引入基于立场的评估框架，结合PU在线学习和指令调优语言模型，评估隐含意见的表示。

Result: 框架能够揭示隐含意见的（错误）表示，为模型行为的包容性改进提供路径。

Conclusion: 通过关注隐含立场，该方法为构建更具包容性和规范对齐的对话模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoL-RL是一种新的训练范式，通过双目标优化框架将多步环境反馈信号整合到LLM中，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效利用多步离散的环境反馈信号，导致信息丢失或未能充分利用反馈。

Method: 结合MoL持续训练和GRPO后训练，分离领域特定信号与通用语言能力，将多步反馈蒸馏为单步推理。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，MoL-RL表现优异，尤其在Qwen3-8B模型上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: MoL-RL为利用多步文本反馈增强LLM推理能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型内部语言处理机制，理解其与单语言模型的差异。

Method: 使用logit lens和神经元专业化分析技术，对比Aya-23-8B与单语言模型的表现。

Result: Aya-23-8B在翻译时激活相关语言表征，混合代码任务中神经元激活模式受基础语言影响，语言特定神经元集中在最后层。

Conclusion: 多语言训练显著影响模型内部处理机制，为跨语言迁移研究提供新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯方言与标准阿拉伯语的差异限制了数字服务和教育资源的访问，阻碍了机器翻译的发展，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 论文评估了六种大型语言模型的提示技术，并开发了资源高效的微调流程，包括量化模型和联合多方言训练。

Result: GPT-4o在提示技术中表现最佳，量化后的Gemma2-9B模型在微调中表现优于零样本GPT-4o，联合训练模型性能提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的情况下，也能实现高质量的方言翻译，为阿拉伯语NLP的包容性提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize
speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model
builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory
underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.
DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with

Result: RMTBench提供了更贴近实际应用的评估框架，填补了学术评估与实际部署间的差距。

Conclusion: RMTBench为LLMs的角色扮演能力评估提供了更有效的工具，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何内部控制输出序列长度的机制。

Method: 通过实验分析LLMs内部表示，特别是多头注意力机制，并调整特定隐藏单元以控制输出长度。

Result: 发现长度信息部分解耦于语义信息，且某些隐藏单元对长度特异性提示更敏感。

Conclusion: LLMs具备无需外部控制的鲁棒且适应性强的输出长度调节机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

Motivation: 解决在视觉任务中，传统CoT提示无法同时处理感知、理解和判断的问题。

Method: 提出Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT)，分三阶段（感知、情境、规范）引导模型推理。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，CoCoT平均表现优于CoT和直接提示8%。

Conclusion: CoCoT提升了模型的解释性和社会意识，为更安全可靠的多模态系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

TL;DR: CONCAP是一种多语言图像描述模型，通过结合检索到的描述和图像特定概念，减少多语言训练需求，提升低资源语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言视觉语言模型因训练数据有限和参数化成本高而落后于英语模型的问题。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）方法，结合图像特定概念，减少对多语言训练的依赖。

Result: 在XM3600数据集上表现优异，显著减少数据需求，提升低资源语言性能。

Conclusion: 概念感知检索增强能有效缩小多语言性能差距。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

*Khloud AL Jallad,Nada Ghneim,Ghaida Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文综述了自然语言理解（NLU）评估基准，特别是诊断数据集和覆盖的语言现象，并呼吁建立统一的评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究NLU评估基准的现状，发现缺乏统一的命名规范和标准语言现象覆盖，提出建立类似ISO标准的评估体系。

Method: 通过详细比较和分析现有的英语、阿拉伯语和多语言NLU基准，特别是其诊断数据集和语言现象覆盖情况。

Result: 发现现有基准在命名规范和语言现象覆盖上存在不足，提出了建立全球语言现象层次结构的必要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁制定统一的NLU诊断评估标准，以更深入地比较不同模型的性能。

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于代码提示的新方法，通过将代码嵌入提示中，提升大语言模型（LLMs）在命名实体识别（NER）任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖输入上下文信息，而NER任务需要结合详细的标注要求。

Method: 利用代码提示，嵌入BIO标注模式的详细指令，结合链式思维提示进一步提升性能。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，代码提示方法优于传统文本提示，验证了结构化指令的有效性。

Conclusion: 代码提示方法显著提升了LLMs在NER任务中的表现，结合链式思维提示可进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

TL;DR: Text-JEPA是一个轻量级框架，用于将自然语言转换为一级逻辑（NL2FOL），结合双系统认知理论，提高封闭领域问答系统的效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 封闭领域（如教育、医疗、法律）需要透明且可解释的问答系统，现有神经符号框架效率低下且依赖大规模模型。

Method: 提出Text-JEPA框架，模拟双系统认知理论（System 1生成逻辑表示，System 2进行逻辑推理），并引入三个评估指标。

Result: 在特定领域数据集上，Text-JEPA性能接近大型LLM系统，但计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理框架在专业领域中具有高效和可解释问答系统的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

Conclusion: AQUA填补了AI在水产养殖领域的空白，为行业创新提供了新方向。

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty
Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key
findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on

a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

Result: 总结了ASB预测的核心任务类型、建模技术趋势及数据集影响，指出了方法论挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 本文为ASB预测领域提供了统一框架，指导未来研究实现更稳健和社会责任导向的预测。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的KGC方法依赖隐式知识表示，容易传播错误知识，限制了推理的准确性和决定性。

Method: 提出OL-KGC方法，利用神经感知机制嵌入结构信息，并通过自动提取算法将本体知识转化为LLM可理解的文本格式。

Result: 在FB15K-237、UMLS和WN18RR三个基准测试中，OL-KGC显著优于现有主流方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: OL-KGC通过结合结构信息和本体知识，有效提升了知识图谱补全的性能和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: GRPO在处理异常重要性加权奖励时表现不稳定，导致策略更新不稳定，影响模型性能。

Method: GMPO通过最大化几何平均奖励替代算术平均奖励，减少对异常值的敏感性，保持重要性采样比的稳定范围。

Result: GMPO-7B在数学和多模态推理基准测试中平均分别优于GRPO 4.1%和1.4%。

Conclusion: GMPO在稳定性和性能上均优于GRPO，适用于语言模型的推理任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

Motivation: 多语言错误信息的快速传播需要能够处理细粒度真实性评估的自动化事实核查系统，而大型语言模型在此任务中的表现尚未充分研究。

Method: 在X-Fact数据集（涵盖25种语言和7种真实性类别）上对五种最先进的语言模型（包括XLM-R、mT5、Llama 3.1、Qwen 2.5和Mistral Nemo）进行了全面评估，比较了提示和微调方法。

Result: XLM-R以57.7%的宏F1分数显著优于所有测试的大型模型（最佳LLM为16.9%），比之前的最佳性能（41.9%）提高了15.8%。

Conclusion: 对于细粒度多语言事实核查任务，小型专用模型可能比通用大型模型更有效，这对事实核查系统的实际部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估数据集主要针对纯文本提示，忽略了视觉漏洞，亟需填补这一空白。

Method: 通过识别文本中的有害内容并将其转化为排版图像，生成多模态提示，评估VLMs的脆弱性。

Result: 开源VLMs在引入视觉输入时更易受提示注入攻击，且性能与闭源前沿模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: Text2VLM为全面安全评估提供了可扩展工具，有助于开发更强大的VLM安全机制。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过结构剪枝和高效恢复训练直接压缩多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的方法，以减少计算和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前参数减少技术主要依赖从小语言模型（SLMs）训练MLLMs，灵活性有限且计算成本高。

Method: 研究了两种结构剪枝范式（层间和宽度剪枝），结合监督微调和知识蒸馏，并评估了使用少量数据进行恢复训练的可行性。

Result: 宽度剪枝在资源有限时表现更好；仅微调多模态投影器在小压缩级别（<20%）足够；结合监督微调和隐藏状态蒸馏效果最佳；仅需5%数据即可恢复95%性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为压缩MLLMs提供了实用方案，无需大量计算资源或数据。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练语言模型的兴起，通用文本嵌入因其在多种NLP任务中的高效表现而受到广泛关注。本文旨在全面梳理PLMs在GPTE发展中的角色。

Result: 总结了PLMs在GPTE中的核心贡献，并提出了未来研究方向，如排名集成、安全性考虑等。

Conclusion: 本文为研究GPTE的现状与未来潜力提供了重要参考，尤其适合新入门和资深研究者。

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化工具PFD Toolkit，用于分析英格兰和威尔士的预防未来死亡（PFD）报告，验证其在儿童自杀案例识别和主题分析中的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动分析PFD报告耗时且效率低，需要一种自动化方法来提高效率和可靠性。

Method: 使用开源语言模型管道（PFD Toolkit）自动处理4,249份PFD报告，识别儿童自杀案例并进行主题编码。

Result: PFD Toolkit识别出72例儿童自杀报告，是手动方法的两倍，且与临床注释的一致性高（Cohen's κ = 0.82）。处理时间从数月缩短至8分钟。

Conclusion: 自动化LLM分析能高效可靠地复制手动主题分析，为公共卫生提供可扩展、可重复和及时的见解。

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

TL;DR: DEP框架通过潜在空间建模用户间差异，优于依赖语言提示的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视用户间差异，且语言提示难以有效提取差异。

Method: DEP通过对比用户嵌入与相似内容交互的同行嵌入，构建软提示，并使用稀疏自编码器过滤任务相关特征。

Result: 在个性化评论生成任务中，DEP在多个指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DEP提供了一种更有效的个性化输出生成方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

Motivation: 研究多样性的动机包括促进包容性、模拟人类语言行为以及提升系统性能。

Method: 调查了过去6年ACL Anthology中标题含“多样性”的文章，提出了一个基于生态学和经济学理论的统一分类法。

Result: 发现多样性测量方法多样且术语不一致，提出了一个包含多样性、平衡性和差异性的三维框架。

Conclusion: 研究为NLP中多样性的形式化提供了基础，有助于更好地理解和比较不同方法。

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

TL;DR: 研究评估了九种开源生成式LLM在荷兰语临床信息提取任务中的表现，发现部分14B参数模型表现优异，70B模型性能略高但计算成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告信息提取面临非结构化和领域语言挑战，且专有LLM存在透明度和隐私问题，需开源替代方案。

Method: 开发了公开框架llm_extractinator，在零样本设置下评估开源LLM在DRAGON基准（28个荷兰语任务）中的表现。

Result: 14B参数模型（如Phi-4-14B）表现竞争力强，70B模型性能略优但成本高；翻译至英语会降低性能。

Conclusion: 开源LLM结合框架可为低资源临床信息提取提供高效、可扩展且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Soft Injection的新方法，通过任务嵌入和软混合参数优化，减少提示长度并提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多示例提示是否是最有效传达任务信息的方式，并提出更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用少量示例构建任务嵌入，并通过软混合参数将其与注意力头激活结合，避免推理时的重复计算。

Result: 在57个任务和12个LLM上验证，平均性能比10-shot ICL提升10.1%-13.9%，同时降低内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: Soft Injection为减少提示长度和提升性能提供了新范式，揭示了注意力头的任务特定功能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset
designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical
recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains
32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical
subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with
Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii)
Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as
Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial
gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

Motivation: 社交媒体中性别歧视问题普遍存在，需要通过技术手段进行识别和分类。

Method: 采用三种模型：SCBM（基于形容词的瓶颈概念）、SCBMT（结合形容词和Transformer）和微调的XLM-RoBERTa。

Result: XLM-RoBERTa在子任务1.1中排名第6（英语和西班牙语）和第4（英语）；SCBMT排名第7（英语和西班牙语）和第6（西班牙语）。

Conclusion: 模型在性别歧视识别任务中表现良好，同时提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的解决方案，可增强大语言模型在金融及其他领域的可信度和一致性。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and

Result: 指令调优显著降低多样性，DPO影响最大；conformative解码能增加多样性且保持质量。

Conclusion: 指令调优损害多样性，但conformative解码可有效恢复多样性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Method: 采用成员推理攻击和生成任务两种方法，分析权重矩阵、困惑度及LoRA秩对记忆化的影响。

Result: 发现Value和Output矩阵对记忆化贡献更大；低困惑度与高记忆化相关；高LoRA秩增加记忆化但边际效应递减。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型性能与隐私风险的权衡，为开发更负责任的大型语言模型微调策略提供了依据。

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL为解决LLM评估中的角色设计和通用性问题提供了有效方案，显著提升了评估质量。

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降，表现为低对比度、噪声和细节模糊，亟需有效解决方案。

Method: 基于颜色亮度分析，计算平均颜色以确定自适应伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: TAGC模型显著提升了低光照图像质量，保持了细节、自然对比度和正确色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC是一种高效的低光照图像处理方案，适用于夜间监控、医学图像增强等应用。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型Transformer感知的多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络（T-MPEDNet），用于CT扫描中肝脏和肿瘤的自动分割，解决了肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉特征多样性的挑战，并在公开数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏和肿瘤的精确自动分割对快速诊断和制定治疗计划至关重要，但现有方法面临肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉特征多样性的挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合Transformer动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用，并通过形态学边界细化提升边界清晰度。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet的肝脏和肿瘤分割DSC分别达到97.6%/89.1%和98.3%/83.3%，优于12种先进方法。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的肝脏和肿瘤自动分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS提出了一种统一的部分感知实例分割（PIS）方法，用于手术器械分割，结合了实例级和部分级分割任务，并通过弱监督学习和师生框架解决了数据标注不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理手术器械的实例级分割（IIS）或部分级语义分割（PSS），缺乏任务间的交互。SurgPIS旨在统一这两项任务，提升分割性能。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，引入部分特定查询，将部分与父器械实例显式关联。通过弱监督学习从部分标注数据中训练，并使用师生框架保持预测一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SurgPIS在PIS、IIS、PSS及器械级语义分割任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS通过统一任务和弱监督学习，显著提升了手术器械分割的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有VideoLLM模型仅支持文本响应，缺乏对对象中心多轮交互的灵活性。

Method: 引入支持视觉和文本提示的VideoLLM模型，提出STOM模块实现视觉提示的时空传播，并构建VideoInfer数据集。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，模型在视频问答和分割任务上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态、对象中心的视频理解中表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的异常检测面临特征表示差异和复杂解剖结构关系的挑战，现有方法难以学习有效的类别特定特征。

Method: 提出Exemplar Med-DETR，利用跨注意力机制和直观的类别特定示例特征，采用迭代训练策略。

Result: 在四种公共数据集的三种影像模态中表现优异，如越南密集乳腺钼靶的肿块检测mAP达0.7，钙化检测mAP达0.55。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医学影像中实现鲁棒和通用检测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

Method: 使用商业生成AI工具创建了包含10,710张面部表情图像的合成数据集，涵盖多种人口统计学特征。

Conclusion: SynPAIN填补了疼痛评估研究的空白，提供了多样化的合成数据集，并建立了测量和缓解算法偏见的框架。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

Result: 在12个电商领域数据集上，DPO微调显著优于监督模型，且性能随未标记数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: 半监督DPO方法能高效利用未标记数据，降低计算开销，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和独立变化，并在ADNI数据中发现了淀粉样PET和MR图像之间的生物学合理共变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is

this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 研究强调了偏见分析的紧迫性，并提供了减少偏见的潜在方法。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

Conclusion: uQRPCA+是一种高效且性能优越的方法，适用于彩色视频处理，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 提高稀疏LiDAR点条件下的立体匹配精度，解决LiDAR引导效果下降的问题。

Method: 通过插值预填充稀疏初始视差图，并结合两种预填充方法（视差图和图像特征）。

Result: GRAFT-Stereo在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配提供了新思路，有望启发更有效的方法。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a

*Jeongwoo Shin,Inseo Lee,Junho Lee,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自引导的掩码自编码器（MAE），通过利用其内部学习的补丁聚类信息生成掩码，替代了原始MAE的随机掩码，显著提升了学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MAE在自监督表示学习中取得了成功，但其具体学习机制尚未完全明确。本文旨在深入分析MAE的学习过程，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过分析发现MAE早期即学习补丁级聚类模式，基于此提出自引导MAE，利用聚类信息生成掩码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了学习效率，且无需依赖外部模型或额外信息。

Conclusion: 自引导MAE在多种下游任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Kanglin Qu,Pan Gao,Qun Dai,Yuanhao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HydraMamba提出了一种基于状态空间模型的点云网络，通过改进点云序列化和局部学习，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在点云学习中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了长距离依赖建模。状态空间模型（S6）具有线性复杂度，但现有方法在点云序列化和局部学习方面仍有不足。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略和ConvBiS6层，结合多头设计（MHS6），以协同捕捉局部几何和全局上下文依赖。

Result: HydraMamba在多个任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和局部学习，提升了点云学习的长距离依赖建模能力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因高复杂度和计算成本无法实时应用的问题，以及分离湍流抑制和目标检测导致的效率低下和性能不佳。

Method: 提出JDATT框架，结合特征级（CWD和MGD）和输出级（KL散度）蒸馏策略，整合湍流抑制和检测模块。

Result: 在合成和真实湍流数据集上，JDATT在视觉恢复和检测精度上表现优异，同时显著减少模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT适用于实时部署，为资源受限环境提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频显著目标检测依赖运动线索，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法生成的视频序列缺乏语义运动理解。

Method: TransFlow从预训练视频扩散模型迁移运动知识，生成具有语义感知的光流数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现提升，验证了运动知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow通过生成逼真训练数据，解决了视频显著目标检测的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Result: 在所有公开VOS基准测试中达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: DepthFlow为数据稀缺问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Motivation: 随着计算机视觉模型的快速发展，对计算资源的需求不断增加，但在资源受限的环境中部署模型时，需要更高效的架构。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的神经网络架构可以提高效率，使模型更小、更快、更经济。

Conclusion: 通过架构优化，可以在减少计算资源的同时提升模型性能，适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Conclusion: ForCenNet通过关注前景元素，显著提升了文档图像校正的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

TL;DR: DS-Det提出了一种新型解码器范式，通过灵活的单查询机制和注意力解耦学习，解决了固定查询的局限性和ROT问题，提升了检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用未充分探索，固定查询限制了灵活性，且存在ROT和查询模糊性问题。

Method: 引入单查询范式，将固定查询转为灵活查询；通过注意力解耦学习简化解码器框架，分别处理定位和去重任务；提出PoCoo损失优化难样本学习。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上，DS-Det在多种骨干模型上表现出优越性和普适性。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和注意力解耦，显著提升了解码器效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

Conclusion: SeeDiff展示了Stable Diffusion在自动标注任务中的潜力，提供了一种高效的无监督方法。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干旱地区城市洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重威胁，传统洪水地图方法因光谱对比度低和快速水文动态而受限。

Method: FM-LC采用三阶段方法：多类U-Net初步分类、专家模型纠正混淆类别、贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在迪拜2024年风暴事件中验证，F1分数平均提升29%，洪水边界更清晰。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架在干旱城市洪水地图中表现优异，优于传统单阶段方法。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

Result: 实验显示，Lava在查询性能上提升14% F1分数，降低0.39 MPAE，处理速度快9.6倍。

Conclusion: Lava通过自然语言驱动，实现了高效灵活的视频分析，为大规模视频数据处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用1D CNN进行时间压缩处理姿态序列，结合预训练的AraGPT2解码器直接生成文本（glosses）。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，WER分数提升了6.1%，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过直接映射姿态序列到文本，避免了传统对齐机制的局限性，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Motivation: 解决负提示调优在OOD检测中导致的泛化性能下降问题。

Method: 采用NFT对预训练文本特征进行分布感知变换，分离正负特征；引入轻量级元网络实现动态适应；通过KR策略优化模型。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著降低了FPR95（5.44%），同时提升了ID分类准确率和OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在OOD检测和泛化性能上均优于传统方法，适用于少样本场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint

effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a

along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

TL;DR: RaGS框架利用3D高斯泼溅技术融合4D雷达和单目图像，实现高效3D物体检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有融合方法在场景理解或网格结构上的局限性。

Method: 采用级联流程：FLI初始化高斯位置，IMA融合语义和几何信息，MGF生成BEV特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态聚焦稀疏物体，提供高效且全面的场景感知。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

TL;DR: OW-CLIP是一个视觉分析系统，通过数据高效的多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术，解决了开放世界目标检测中的数据依赖和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开放世界目标检测方法依赖大量标注数据且易过拟合，OW-CLIP旨在通过数据高效训练和可视化工具提升性能。

Method: 采用多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术，结合双模态数据精炼方法和可视化界面优化标注质量。

Result: OW-CLIP仅需3.8%的自生成数据即可达到89%的SOTA性能，数据量相同时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过数据高效训练和高质量标注工具，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像恢复（MedIR）面临多任务异质性和多样化信息丢失的挑战，现有方法难以应对。

Method: DiffCode通过构建任务自适应码本库和潜在扩散策略，整合任务特定高质量先验特征并优化潜在特征分布。

Result: DiffCode在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成三个任务中表现出卓越的定量指标和视觉质量。

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本和潜在扩散策略，成功解决了多任务MedIR的挑战。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言跟踪器难以动态适应目标状态变化和多样化文本表达，导致跟踪效果不佳。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，ATCTrack实现了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态多模态线索对齐和特征建模，显著提升了复杂长时场景下的跟踪鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Conclusion: 该方法在GPS缺失的室内环境中验证有效，为实时四旋翼控制提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，全局模型显著优于单客户端模型，仅比全数据训练模型低2 mIoU。

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效提升了合成到真实语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA)的插件方法，通过调整注意力权重增强视觉-语言变换器的目标定位能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉-语言变换器在目标定位任务中的性能，同时保持模型的轻量化和可解释性。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端激活值并放大中等激活值，重新加权最终层注意力，使语义相关但被抑制的标记能够指导预测。

Result: 在15个开源视觉-语言模型中，RCA在11个模型上提升了FitAP指标，最高提升26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA不仅提高了性能，还增强了模型的可解释性，适用于多模态变换器。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Conclusion: TrackAny3D为统一模型的重要性提供了启示，并推动大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于深度子空间聚类（DSC）的小批量训练策略，通过引入内存库保存全局特征表示，克服了传统全批量处理的瓶颈。此外，还提出了一种无解码器框架，利用对比学习替代自编码器，减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSC方法依赖全批量处理，限制了其在大规模高分辨率图像上的可扩展性。

Method: 1. 引入内存库保存全局特征表示；2. 提出无解码器框架，使用对比学习进行表示学习。

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上，性能优于其他最先进的子空间聚类方法，且与全批量方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了DSC的可扩展性，还通过无解码器设计降低了计算成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和特征融合，显著提升了伪造视频检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++通过结合CNN和Mamba的优势，实现了高效且准确的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在异常检测任务中具有高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our
pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various
state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

Result: 在BHF ECG Challenge数据集上，AUC达到0.9534，F1分数为0.7801，优于单个模型。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了诊断流程，能有效处理真实世界中的噪声，为资源有限环境下的自动化CVD诊断提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Conclusion: FROSS为实时3D语义场景图生成提供了一种高效解决方案，并公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient
and efficient deployment strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，现有视网膜成像方法（如眼底照片和OCT）无法捕捉关键血管特征，且风险评估过于简单。

Method: 提出OCTA-CVD数据集和VAMPIRE模型，包含MBD模块（捕捉血管轨迹）和IEM模块（分析血管形态）。

Result: 实验表明，VAMPIRE在性能上优于现有分类模型和OCTA检测方法。

Conclusion: VAMPIRE为心血管风险评估提供了更精确和临床实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes
and the collected OCTA-CVD dataset are available at

Motivation: 现有视觉语言对比模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）依赖全局表示，限制了其在密集预测任务中的效果。

Method: 构建十亿级候选区域数据集，提出Region Transformer层提取区域语义，设计统一的区域聚类判别损失。

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和MLLM视觉感知任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RICE通过区域级学习显著提升了密集预测任务的性能，模型已开源。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been
released at https://github.com/deepglint/MVT.

Motivation: 解决在连续数据流中仅能获取单个样本时如何有效利用查询决策的挑战，同时满足延迟和内存限制。

Result: 在10个跨数据集转移基准和4个领域泛化数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持合理的延迟和内存开销。

Conclusion: TTAL框架为安全关键应用（如自动驾驶和医疗诊断）提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器，解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息丢失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长距离结构建模困难等挑战，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能建模全局依赖，但导致局部高频信息丢失和空间结构退化。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）恢复高频信息，以及自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）重建2D空间相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了一种灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述任务中表现优异，但生成的描述往往简短且缺乏细节，主要原因是训练过程中对EOS标记的偏见。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，但幻觉率也有所上升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于任何预训练模型，显著提升了图像描述的详细程度。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达性强的扩散生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理高光谱图像及其他高维视觉数据的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新思路和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroVoxel-LM框架通过动态分辨率体素化和轻量级元嵌入技术，提升了3D场景感知的效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言模型在处理稀疏、大规模点云时存在特征提取慢和表示精度低的问题。

Method: 提出NeuroVoxel-LM框架，结合动态分辨率多尺度体素化（DR-MSV）和轻量级元嵌入机制（TAP-LME）。

Result: DR-MSV显著提升点云特征提取效率与精度，TAP-LME在捕捉细粒度语义上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM有效解决了3D场景感知中的关键挑战，为语言驱动的认知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Local2Global（L2G）是一种在线视频实例分割框架，通过结合局部和全局查询以及轻量级Transformer解码器（L2G-aligner），实现了高效且时间一致的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频分割方法在处理长序列和捕捉渐变时表现优异，但时间一致性预测仍具挑战性，尤其是在噪声累积、遮挡和场景转换时。

Method: 提出Local2Global框架，包括局部查询（捕获每帧的空间特征）和全局查询（包含时空表示），并通过L2G-aligner实现早期对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21（54.3和49.4 AP）和OVIS（37.0 AP）。

Conclusion: L2G框架通过简单在线训练实现了高效且时间一致的视频实例分割，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

Result: 在两个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，准确率和F1分数更高。

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智慧农业提供了实用解决方案，并为行业和学术界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

Abstract: We introduce an end-to-end pipeline that leverages a fine-tuned YOLO12l-seg
model -- trained on over 500 annotated post-blast images -- to deliver
real-time instance segmentation (Box mAP@0.5 ~ 0.769, Mask mAP@0.5 ~ 0.800 at ~

which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated

Result: 在DVTOD、DroneVehicle和M3FD数据集上，WMNet实现了最先进的性能，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: WMNet通过自适应跨模态特征对齐和融合，显著提升了检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Motivation: 现有监督低光图像增强研究中，增强图像与真实图像之间的亮度不匹配问题被忽视，误导了模型训练。

Method: 提出GT-mean loss，从概率角度直接建模图像均值，扩展现有损失函数，计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss能一致提升不同方法和数据集的性能。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss简单有效，解决了亮度不匹配问题，推动了低光图像增强研究。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在整合视觉数据时面临数据质量挑战，而高质量训练样本比大量数据更有效。

Method: 使用一个经过精细调优的小型VLM，评估和过滤训练样本的图像和标题质量及对齐性。

Result: 实验表明，经过过滤的数据集性能优于或等同于更大但噪声更多的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量视觉语言训练语料提供了一种轻量且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of

Motivation: 现有体育视频描述方法通常忽略玩家身份，或依赖与视频内容无关的额外信息导致身份识别错误，限制了其应用。

Method: 设计了身份相关信息提取模块（IRIEM）和视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），结合玩家识别网络（PIN）和双向语义交互模块（BSIM），生成多模态提示以驱动大型语言模型。

Result: 在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上实验表明，模型性能优越。

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC通过多模态信息融合，有效提升了体育视频描述中玩家身份的准确性。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨骼比例或结构的差异，运动数据难以在骨架间转移，TPC提供了一种跨兼容的运动表示方式，但缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的能力。

Method: 提出PUMPS架构，通过独立降维帧级点云为可采样特征向量，并利用潜在高斯噪声向量作为采样标识符重构TPC，引入线性分配优化重建过程。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等任务中表现优异，无需原生数据集监督即可达到先进水平，并在微调任务中超越其他方法。

Conclusion: PUMPS为TPC数据提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案，展示了其在运动合成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用（如自动驾驶和人形机器人操作）需要精确的空间感知，但VLMs如何识别空间关系和感知空间运动尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个完全合成的数据集，将空间理解分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解两类，并测试了多种先进VLMs。

Result: 人类在所有任务中表现近乎完美，而VLMs仅在两个最简单任务中达到人类水平，其余任务表现明显较低，某些任务甚至接近零分。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs的空间理解能力仍有显著不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略光照变化对红外和可见光图像融合的影响，导致模态偏差，MoCTEFuse旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用光照门控的MoCTE，包含高、低光照专家子网络，基于手性变换器融合块（CTFB）动态切换模态并分配权重，通过多阶段堆叠逐步聚合信息。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，检测mAP在MFNet和DroneVehicle数据集上分别达到70.93%和45.14%。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse通过动态光照适应和竞争性损失函数，显著提升了图像融合质量和检测性能。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,

### [208] [SAMwave: Wavelet-Driven Feature Enrichment for Effective Adaptation of Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20186)
*Saurabh Yadav,Avi Gupta,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMwave是一种基于小波变换的新方法，用于改进Segment Anything Model（SAM）在复杂任务中的性能，显著优于现有适配方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（如SAM）在复杂任务中性能下降，现有适配方法因特征提取技术受限而效果有限。

Method: 提出SAMwave，利用小波变换提取多尺度高频特征，并引入复数适配器捕捉复数空间频率信息。

Result: 在四项低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有方法，适用于SAM和SAM2两种架构。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，为改进基础模型的适应性提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

Motivation: 自然场景中的文本检测面临多样脚本和任意形状的挑战，现有方法未能充分利用语义上下文。

Method: 结合预训练的CLIP模型和AFPN进行多尺度视觉特征融合，引入语言-视觉解码器通过跨模态注意力传播语义信息，并采用文本到像素对比学习机制。

Result: 在MLT-2019和CTW1500数据集上分别达到84.8%和90.2%的F-score，表现优异。

Conclusion: SAViL-Det通过语义和视觉特征的深度融合，显著提升了多脚本和任意形状文本的检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale
visual feature fusion. The core of the proposed framework is a novel
language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic
information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark
multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉方法在手语数据集中面部表情分类的能力，并研究听力正常与聋哑者在情绪表现上的差异。

Method: 引入基于直方图均衡化和微调的颜色归一化阶段，分别测试上下半脸的表情识别。

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Result: 模型整体准确率为83.63%，优于其他对比模型，并在所有评估指标中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效捕捉矿区场景的全局和局部特征，提升分类精度，为矿区监测和规划提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: 现有系统通过预定义标签或隐式伪标签控制手势生成，但会损失原始运动示例的丰富细节。

Method: 通过微调LLMs同时解析语音音频和运动示例，将运动示例作为显式查询上下文以指导手势生成。

Result: 在Fr'echet Gesture Distance（FGD）、运动多样性和示例-手势相似性三个指标上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MECo框架实现了细粒度身体部位控制，支持多种输入模态，并公开了代码和预训练模型。

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精地图对自动驾驶至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用时序信息或计算开销大。

Method: MambaMap结合记忆库动态更新BEV特征和实例查询，引入门控机制和多方向时空扫描策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaMap在提升预测精度和时序一致性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（GS）在高质量场景重建中表现优异，但其训练过程因高斯原语的空间分布不理想和低效的密集化而收敛缓慢。

Method: 通过分析密集化阶段的分裂和克隆操作，提出全局到局部密集化策略，并结合能量引导的粗到细多分辨率训练框架，动态修剪不必要的高斯原语。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著加速训练（2倍以上），使用更少的高斯原语且重建性能更优。

Conclusion: 提出的策略和框架有效解决了GS训练中的收敛问题，提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Result: 实验评估了代表性视觉模型，揭示了从动物痕迹中识别物种的关键挑战。

Conclusion: AnimalClue填补了间接证据物种识别的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

Result: 在五个公开MI数据集上，MIRepNet表现优于现有专业化和通用化EEG模型。

Conclusion: MIRepNet为MI范式提供了高效的基础模型，适用于少量数据场景。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过调整加权系数，有效平衡了算法的效用与公平性，且优于现有方法。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架通过测试时训练显著提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different

are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散模型的方法在图像超分辨率中因VAE的激进下采样（8倍）导致细节（如小字符和纹理）重建效果差，需解决这一问题。

Method: 通过TVT策略，先训练4倍解码器，再训练4倍编码器，并优化网络架构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验表明，TVT显著改善了细节保留，且计算量少于现有一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT策略有效解决了细节重建问题，同时降低了计算成本，为图像超分辨率提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT框架通过无监督采样和梯度分析，快速适应跨传感器数据，显著减少适应时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全量重训练。

Method: 使用无监督采样策略选择目标域中最具信息量的样本，通过梯度分析识别并更新敏感权重。

Result: 适应时间从小时级缩短至约一分钟，性能优于直接迁移基准，甚至媲美全量重训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，性能达到新标杆。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Rui Han,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法，用于在动态视频中插入3D对象，以实现时间一致性和真实光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态场景中插入3D对象时的时间一致性和真实光照问题，传统方法难以兼顾这两点。

Method: 结合3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的高时间一致性和2D扩散模型的真实光照增强，通过分离对象固有属性并优化多帧加权调整。

Result: 实现了在动态手腕场景中插入手镯的高质量视频编辑，兼具时间一致性和真实光照。

Conclusion: 该方法首次将3D渲染与2D扩散模型结合，为视频对象插入提供了高效且逼真的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

TL;DR: 论文提出$A^2R^2$框架，通过注意力引导的视觉推理改进Img2LaTeX任务，显著提升性能，并引入新数据集Img2LaTeX-Hard-1K进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其在细粒度视觉元素处理上存在不足，需改进。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代细化，实现自我修正和逐步优化预测质量。

Result: 实验表明$A^2R^2$在六项评估指标上显著优于基线方法，推理轮次增加带来性能提升。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$框架有效提升Img2LaTeX任务性能，核心组件协同作用显著。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Motivation: 腹腔镜肝脏手术中，术前信息与术中视图的融合需要准确的肝脏变形预测，但现有方法因大变形、噪声数据和有限视野而受限。

Method: 提出PIVOTS神经网络，利用几何特征提取编码器和变形感知交叉注意力模块，直接从点云预测变形。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，PIVOTS表现出优于基线方法的配准性能，对噪声、大变形和有限视野具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PIVOTS为肝脏手术中的非刚性配准提供了高效解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集以促进公平比较。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code
and datasets are available here https://github.com/pengliu-nct/PIVOTS.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了AR中的视觉信息操纵攻击，提出了一种分类法、数据集和检测框架，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR中的虚拟内容可能导致误导或有害信息，引发语义误解或用户错误，因此需要研究如何检测和防范此类攻击。

Method: 提出了一种分类法（字符、短语、模式操纵）和目的（信息替换、混淆、额外错误信息），构建了数据集AR-VIM，并开发了多模态语义推理框架VIM-Sense。

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上的攻击检测准确率为88.94%，优于仅视觉或仅文本的基线方法，检测延迟约为7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的视觉信息操纵攻击，为AR安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Diff-FBP的两阶段框架，通过生成模型预训练提取领域特定特征，显著提升了面部美观预测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部美观预测（FBP）因其主观性和细微特征而具有挑战性，现有方法难以学习与高级美学评估对齐的特征表示。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）在FFHQ数据集上通过自监督去噪任务预训练扩散变换器；2）冻结预训练编码器，仅微调轻量回归头。

Result: 在FBP5500基准测试中，Diff-FBP的Pearson相关系数（PCC）达到0.932，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式预训练策略是关键，能够为主观视觉任务提取更具语义特征表示。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临复杂非人类角色、多样化动作和精细情感的挑战，且缺乏大规模多模态数据。

Method: 构建了包含40万视频片段的多模态数据集MagicAnime，并设计了MagicAnime-Bench基准。

Result: 在四项任务中验证了数据集的有效性，支持高保真、细粒度和可控的生成。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集填补了卡通动画多模态数据的空白，为相关研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

TL;DR: ModalFormer是一个多模态低光图像增强框架，通过整合九种辅助模态信息，利用跨模态Transformer和CM-MSA机制，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强面临噪声、细节丢失和对比度差等问题，现有方法仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态信息的丰富上下文。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，通过CM-MSA机制融合RGB数据与多种模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过多模态信息整合显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Conclusion: 论文验证了语义分割模型在印度驾驶数据集上的有效性，为自动驾驶研究提供了新数据支持。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Conclusion: VESPA展示了在可扩展3D场景理解中的强大性能，为自动驾驶数据标注提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

TL;DR: SparseVAR是一种用于视觉自回归模型的加速框架，通过动态排除低频率token来减少计算开销，同时保持图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率阶段的计算开销大，低频率token对图像质量影响小且与邻近token相似，因此可以动态排除它们。

Method: 使用轻量级MSE指标识别低频率token，并通过锚点token保持区域保真度。

Result: 在Infinity-2B中实现了2倍加速，且图像质量损失最小。

Conclusion: SparseVAR是一种有效的加速框架，适用于视觉自回归模型的高分辨率阶段。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

TL;DR: 提出一种解决多实例学习（MIL）在临床任务中优先级问题的新方法，通过垂直和水平层次结构优化预测，减少误诊并优先处理重要症状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法未充分解决病理症状和诊断类别的优先级问题，导致模型忽略类别间优先级，影响临床决策。

Method: 提出基于垂直和水平层次结构的新方法，通过层次对齐和隐式特征重用优化MIL预测，优先处理临床更严重的类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少误诊并在多类场景中优先处理重要症状，验证了其组件效果。

Conclusion: 新方法通过层次结构优化MIL预测，提升临床诊断的准确性和优先级处理能力。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了场景对齐和重建质量，适用于机器人感知与自主导航。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Motivation: 准确检测水稻开花时间对杂交水稻制种的及时授粉至关重要，但田间环境的复杂性和颖花的小尺寸、短花期特性使得自动化精确识别具有挑战性。

Method: 改进YOLOv8模型，采用BiFPN替代PANet增强特征融合，并添加p2小目标检测头以减少小目标特征损失。同时构建专用数据集支持模型训练。

Result: 改进后的YOLOv8s-p2模型在mAP@0.5、精确率、召回率和F1分数上分别提升3.10%、8.40%、10.80%和9.79%，运行速度为69 f/s。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv8s-p2模型具有高精度和速度，为杂交水稻制种的自动化监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Method: 采用多任务分割模型，通过Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling（ASPP）调整感受野大小，结合Sentinel-1 SAR和AMSR2数据，分析不同空间上下文对分割性能的影响。

Result: 小感受野适合高分辨率Sentinel-1数据，中等感受野对海冰发展阶段分割更有效，大感受野性能较差。SAR与AMSR2数据融合提升所有任务的分割效果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了根据观测分辨率和目标特性选择适当空间上下文的重要性，为地学应用中深度学习模型的优化提供了指导。

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Result: 在11个广泛使用的数据集上表现优异，证明了主导属性探索的有效性。

Conclusion: 主导属性的研究推动了少样本学习中判别性类特定表示的学习和分类性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Result: 在不引入额外信息的情况下，模型在多个空间理解任务中的平均表现显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: SpatialVTS方法通过视觉和文本双重思考有效提升了空间推理能力，为视觉问答和机器人技术提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成新视图时具有高保真度，并能产生更自然的多面光照和阴影效果。

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感，用户需反复调整且缺乏明确反馈，现有方法可控性有限或需额外训练。

Method: T2I-Copilot包含三个代理：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，分别负责解析提示、选择模型并生成、评估生成结果。

Result: 在GenAI-Bench上，T2I-Copilot性能接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%，且优于其他开源模型。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot显著简化提示工程，提升生成质量，支持全自动或人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频比图像包含更丰富的信息，但现有视频-文本数据集的描述仅反映部分内容，导致匹配时出现部分不对齐。直接对齐文本和视频表示会导致错误监督。

Method: 提出T2VParser，通过自适应分解标记（共享可学习标记）提取多视角语义表示，实现自适应语义对齐而非整体对齐。

Result: 实验证明T2VParser能有效分解跨模态内容，实现精确的部分对齐。

Conclusion: T2VParser在保留预训练模型知识的同时，解决了视频-文本匹配中的部分不对齐问题。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要额外先验信息（如类别标签或3D面部网格）的问题，提升实用性和个性化表现。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）存储和检索通用动作（记忆阶段）；2）通过音频驱动的说话风格特征进行个性化面部动作合成（动画阶段）。

Result: 定量、定性评估及用户研究表明，MemoryTalker在个性化面部动画方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker能够仅凭音频输入生成可靠且个性化的3D面部动画，提升了实用性和表现力。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited
processing rate of 8 grams per minute, the prototype demonstrates the potential
of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）因视觉令牌数量庞大导致计算成本高，现有基于注意力的方法存在局限性（如位置偏差），需探索新视角评估令牌重要性。

Method: 提出TransPrune方法，结合令牌转移变化（TTV）和指令引导注意力（IGA）逐步修剪令牌，无需训练。

Conclusion: TransPrune为令牌修剪提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案，TTV可作为独立标准替代注意力机制。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了草图质量评估，提出了一种无需人工标注的通用方法GACL，通过特征幅值量化草图质量，并在多个应用中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决草图质量评估的缺失问题，提供一种无需人工标注的定量评估方法。

Method: 提出Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL)，将特征幅值与可识别性学习作为双重任务，通过交叉熵分类损失优化。

Result: GACL与人类质量感知一致，并成功应用于草图质量评估、自然图像质量评估和噪声标签清洗。

Conclusion: GACL是一种通用方法，适用于多种视觉表示和任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合心理学先验知识和统计模式的FED-PsyAU框架，通过分层学习和联邦学习解决微表情识别中的小样本和隐私问题。


<details>

Motivation: 微表情识别因样本量小、特征细微及隐私问题而受限，需一种高效且保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 结合心理学对上下部面部动作单元协调的研究，开发DPK-GAT网络进行分层学习，并采用联邦学习框架避免数据共享。

Result: 在常用微表情数据库上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架显著提升了微表情识别性能，同时解决了隐私和小样本问题。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from

Conclusion: LSFDNet在多模态融合和目标检测任务中表现优异，填补了该领域的数据集空白。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法在训练中投影矩阵无约束，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降，现有解决方案缺乏灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: ReSoRA将低秩子矩阵分解为多个等价子空间，并系统地对不同投影的特征分布应用去冗余约束。

Conclusion: ReSoRA作为一种训练监督方法，可无缝集成到现有方法中，且无额外推理成本，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Conclusion: M-Net是一种高效的时序感知MRI肿瘤分割解决方案。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Conclusion: HYPIR在高效性和高质量修复方面表现优异，超越了现有技术。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

TL;DR: 论文提出SCORPION数据集和SimCons框架，旨在解决计算病理学中模型在不同扫描仪间的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中，不同扫描仪引入的变异性影响模型可靠性，需改进扫描仪泛化能力以支持实际应用。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个样本，每个用5台扫描仪扫描）和SimCons框架（结合增强技术和一致性损失）。

Result: SimCons提高了模型在不同扫描仪上的一致性，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: SCORPION和SimCons为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的关键资源，设定了可靠性测试新标准。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双路径架构DAMS，用于视频异常检测，结合多尺度时空特征和跨模态语义对齐，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常检测面临多尺度时间依赖、视觉-语义异构性和标记数据稀缺等挑战，需要一种高效的方法来整合多层次特征和互补信息。

Method: DAMS框架包括主路径（AMTPN和CBAM）和并行路径（CLIP驱动的跨模态语义对齐），通过特征解耦与融合实现异常检测。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准测试中，DAMS框架表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS通过双路径互补和信息融合，构建了全面的异常事件表示与识别能力，为视频异常检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

TL;DR: HAMLET-FFD提出了一种基于认知启发的多模态学习框架，通过双向跨模态推理解决人脸伪造检测的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展对检测方法的跨域泛化能力提出了挑战，传统方法难以学习域不变表示。

Method: HAMLET-FFD利用对比视觉-语言模型（如CLIP），通过知识精炼循环和双向融合机制，结合视觉证据与概念线索进行真实性评估。

Result: 实验表明HAMLET-FFD在多个基准测试中表现出优异的泛化能力，并能识别细粒度伪造痕迹。

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD作为一种外部插件，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时显著提升了人脸伪造检测的跨域性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

TL;DR: 提出一种从2D标量场可视化中恢复连续颜色映射的新方法，通过解耦和重建策略同时预测颜色映射和底层数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有颜色图例的情况下，从2D标量场可视化中恢复连续颜色映射具有挑战性。

Method: 使用解耦模块分离颜色映射和数据，并通过可微分颜色映射模块重建可视化；引入重建损失和颜色顺序损失确保平滑性和正确性。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集（VIS30K）上定量和定性评估，展示了在颜色映射调整和转移中的应用。

Conclusion: 方法有效且通用，适用于带颜色图例或离散调色板的可视化。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Accurate detection of defects such as hotspots and snail trails in
photovoltaic modules is essential for maintaining energy efficiency and system
reliablility. This work presents a supervised deep learning framework for
segmenting thermal infrared images of PV panels, using a dataset of 277 aerial
thermographic images captured by zenmuse XT infrared camera mounted on a DJI
Matrice 100 drone. The preprocessing pipeline includes image resizing, CLAHE

semantic segmentation model based on SegFormer is developed, featuring a
customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on
annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance,
we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using
consistent preprocessing and augmentation. Evaluation metrices includes
per-class Dice score, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, mean IoU, and pixel accuracy.
The SegFormer-based model outperforms baselines in accuracy and efficiency,
particularly for segmenting small and irregular defects. Its lightweight design
real-time deployment on edge devices and seamless integration with drone-based
systems for automated inspection of large-scale solar farms.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多相机系统在受限环境中的姿态估计。

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

Conclusion: 该方法无需预训练扩散器或风格化网络，为跨域图像合成提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案，并发布了基准数据集。

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全张量”的方法，通过可训练的输入向量将文本安全对齐扩展到视觉模态，以解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在多模态输入中的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于文本的大型语言模型（LLM）的安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLM容易受到有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 引入安全张量，这是一种在推理过程中通过文本或视觉模态应用的可训练输入向量，无需修改模型参数。使用包含恶意图像-文本对、对比良性对和一般良性样本的数据集进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLM拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时在良性任务上保持性能不变。内部分析显示，安全张量成功激活了语言模块的文本“安全层”。

Conclusion: 安全张量有效扩展了文本安全机制到视觉模态，填补了跨模态安全空白。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在多种半监督医学分割基准中表现优异。

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态差异问题，提升了AVS的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Conclusion: KASportsFormer在运动场景中显著提升了3D姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

TL;DR: RingMo-Agent是一个多模态多平台遥感图像处理模型，基于用户文本指令执行感知和推理任务，解决了现有方法在异构数据源和复杂任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感视觉语言研究依赖同质数据源，局限于分类或描述任务，无法统一处理多源异构数据。

Method: 提出RingMo-Agent模型，利用大规模RS-VL3M数据集，采用模态自适应表征和任务统一建模方法。

Result: 实验表明，RingMo-Agent在视觉理解和复杂分析任务中表现优异，且具有跨平台和模态的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent为多源遥感数据提供了一个统一且高效的框架，适用于实际应用中的复杂任务。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

TL;DR: FGump是一种基于梯度提升的森林高度估计框架，结合多通道SAR和LiDAR数据，平衡了精度与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的森林高度估计对气候变化监测和碳循环评估至关重要，传统SAR方法结合ML/DL提供了新机会。

Method: FGump利用多通道SAR数据和LiDAR地面真值，通过梯度提升实现高效估计，避免复杂预处理。

Result: FGump在分类和回归任务中表现优异，回归方法避免了量化误差，精度和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FGump在森林高度估计中实现了高精度和低计算成本，优于传统和AI方法。

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为FantasyID的新型公开数据集，用于检测伪造身份证件，模拟真实KYC场景，挑战现有最先进的伪造检测算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于图像生成技术的进步，恶意行为者可以轻松伪造图像，这对KYC应用构成威胁，需要开发更强大的检测系统。

Method: 创建FantasyID数据集，模拟真实ID卡设计，包含多种样式、语言和真实人脸，并通过打印和拍摄生成真实样本，同时模拟数字伪造攻击。

Result: 现有最先进的伪造检测算法在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，误报率为10%时，漏报率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，适合作为检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional
and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter
significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP少样本分类方法的评估基于部分归纳性数据集，无法真实反映模型的归纳泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种使用遗忘技术的管道，建立真实归纳基准，并改进少样本分类方法。

Result: 在真实归纳设置下，现有方法性能显著下降（平均-55%），提出的改进方法在5880次实验中表现最优。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了CLIP少样本分类评估的问题，通过遗忘技术提供解决方案，并提出新的基准和改进方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

Motivation: 解决单编码器架构在多模态任务中的泛化限制和多编码器融合方法的高计算开销问题。

Method: 采用渐进式剪枝策略，包括编码阶段的协作标记分配、融合阶段的跨编码器冗余减少和解码阶段的自适应标记剪枝。

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现优异，相比EAGLE减少了76%的视觉标记，性能仅下降0.3%。

Conclusion: METEOR首次成功实现了高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，为多模态理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM通过2D surfel splatting实现了高效且高精度的SLAM系统，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频合成中缺乏生成能力或忽略对象级结构，需要一种能显式捕捉时序动态并支持对象编辑的方法。

Method: 通过学习姿态不变的对象中心槽，并将其与预训练扩散模型结合，实现视频合成与编辑。

Result: 在视频生成质量和时序一致性上优于现有方法，支持对象插入、删除和替换等编辑操作。

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式视频生成和动态场景理解提供了新可能，显著提升了可控内容创作能力。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

Motivation: 无监督目标发现（UOD）缺乏标注数据，现有方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数，导致性能不稳定。

Result: 实验表明，结合UnionCut或UnionSeg的UOD方法在单目标发现、显著性检测和自监督实例分割任务中性能提升。

Conclusion: UnionCut和UnionSeg为UOD提供了鲁棒的前景判别方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety

attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on

bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key

including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视觉系统在恶劣天气下的可靠性，为全天候应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法提出了显著挑战，同时验证了SAARN模型的有效性。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了低空无人机场景的RIS研究空白，SAARN为处理此类场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QBE检索需要样本查询文档，而ABDIR虽灵活但依赖视觉属性分类。研究旨在利用生成式AI生成查询图像，结合两者优势。

Method: 使用Leonardo.Ai作为T2I生成器，通过文本提示生成查询图像，再通过QBE范式进行特征匹配检索。

Result: 在HisIR19数据集上的实验验证了T2I-QBE的可行性，表明其适用于历史文档检索。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是首次将T2I生成应用于DIR的尝试，为历史文档检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video是一个多模态模型，用于端到端处理视频的视觉、音频和文本信号，支持多粒度视频理解任务，并在实际应用中显著提升了用户参与度和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型缺乏对短视频的深入理解能力，而短视频在移动互联网中占据主导地位，需要更高效的视频理解和推荐技术。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练和最终指令微调的综合训练方案，利用高质量自动标注数据进行训练。

Result: 在ShortVid-Bench基准测试中表现优异，支持零样本或少样本微调，推理时间短（10秒/分钟视频）。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在短视频理解任务中表现出色，实际部署显著提升了用户体验和平台效率。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Leonard Bärmann,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需掩码的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法，解决了现有方法因掩码和身份参考图像导致的信息丢失和性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的方法会导致信息丢失、身份细节保存不足，且身份参考图像可能引入不相关元素，影响生成质量。

Method: 采用两步地标法将输入图像转换为闭口状态，无需掩码或身份参考图像，再通过唇部适配模型生成与音频同步的唇部动作。

Result: 在LRS2和HDTF数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，无需掩码或身份参考即可生成高质量说话人脸视频。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了音频-唇部同步的准确性，同时避免了掩码和身份参考图像的负面影响。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GTAD的全局时间聚合去噪网络，用于高效利用历史观测中的全局时间信息，提升动态环境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用时间信息，主要依赖相邻帧的局部时间交互，缺乏对全局序列信息的有效利用。

Method: 提出GTAD网络，通过局部和全局时间特征的聚合，结合去噪网络，实现更全面的3D场景理解。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GTAD方法能更一致且全面地理解环境，适用于自动驾驶和机器人系统。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用生成式AI合成高质量航空图像及其标签的新方法，通过数据增强提升检测器训练效果，显著改善了跨地理区域的模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在不同地理区域间泛化能力不足的问题，尤其是因环境条件、城市布局等因素导致的领域偏移。

Method: 开发了一种多阶段、多模态知识转移框架，利用微调的潜在扩散模型（LDMs）来缩小源和目标环境之间的分布差距。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在AP50指标上显著优于监督学习、弱监督适应、无监督领域适应和开放集目标检测器，提升幅度分别为4-23%、6-10%、7-40%和50%以上。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨区域车辆检测的领域适应问题，并发布了两个新的航空数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LargeMvC-Net的深度网络架构，用于解决大规模基于锚点的多视图聚类问题，通过分解优化过程为三个模块，显著提升了性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于锚点的多视图聚类方法通常以启发式或任务无关的方式引入锚结构，忽略了核心优化需求。

Method: 将基于锚点的聚类过程分解为三个模块（RepresentModule、NoiseModule、AnchorModule），并通过展开优化步骤设计网络架构。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过结构清晰和可追溯的优化设计，为大规模多视图聚类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多教师对抗鲁棒性蒸馏方法，通过自适应学习策略提升CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对抗训练有进展，CNN的准确性和鲁棒性之间仍存在差距。

Method: 训练多个对抗训练的教师模型，通过多教师知识蒸馏指导学生模型，并采用自适应学习策略分配权重。

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多教师对抗蒸馏和自适应学习策略能有效增强CNN的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用自然语言描述作为监督信号的面部情绪识别方法，通过构建大规模数据集EmoCap100K和框架EmoCapCLIP，显著提升了情绪识别的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情绪识别系统依赖固定标签或抽象维度，限制了泛化能力和适用性。自然语言提供了更灵活、丰富的监督信号，但缺乏相关数据集和有效框架。

Method: 构建EmoCap100K数据集，包含10万样本；提出EmoCapCLIP框架，结合全局-局部对比学习及跨模态引导的正样本挖掘模块。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情绪表征的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过自然语言监督学习情绪表征具有广阔前景，EmoCapCLIP为相关研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一的康复数据集Rehab-Pile，并设计了一个深度学习基准框架，以解决康复运动评估领域缺乏标准化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 康复运动评估需要分析同一动作类别内的运动质量，但现有研究缺乏标准化基准和可复现方法，限制了进展和可比性。

Method: 通过整合现有康复数据集（Rehab-Pile）、提出通用基准框架，并对多种深度学习架构进行分类和回归任务的广泛评估。

Result: 所有数据集和实现均公开，支持透明性和可复现性，为未来研究奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在推动可靠、可访问和个性化的康复解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M，一个公开的大规模图像编辑数据集，旨在解决专有模型对开源研究的限制。通过优化现有数据集并验证其有效性，该数据集显著提升了开源模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于专有多模态模型（如GPT-4o）的封闭性，开源研究受到限制。为了解决这一问题，作者希望提供一个公开的大规模图像编辑数据集，推动开源研究的发展。

Method: 通过GPT-4o统一和优化三个流行图像编辑数据集（OmniEdit、HQ-Edit和UltraEdit），生成高质量的图像三元组（指令、源图像、编辑图像），并改进提示语义清晰度。

Result: 在GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M上微调的开源模型（如FluxKontext）在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著超越以往开源方法，并缩小了与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望推动指令引导图像编辑的开源研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

Motivation: 4D空间智能重建在计算机视觉中具有重要意义，但现有综述缺乏对层次结构的全面分析。

Method: 将现有方法分为五个层次：低层3D属性、3D场景组件、4D动态场景、交互建模和物理约束。

Result: 提出了一个层次化的分类框架，并总结了各层次的关键挑战和未来方向。

Conclusion: 该研究为4D空间智能的未来发展提供了系统化的视角和资源。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

TL;DR: CleANN系统解决了动态图索引在更新和查询时的性能与质量问题，通过三种创新组件实现了高效并发操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图索引在数据更新时存在查询质量下降或全局更新成本高的问题，需要一种高效且质量稳定的解决方案。

Method: CleANN采用工作负载感知链接、查询自适应邻域整合和半懒惰内存清理三种技术。

Result: 在7个数据集上，CleANN在完全动态负载下保持静态索引质量，并发查询吞吐量提升7-1200倍。

Conclusion: CleANN是首个在完全动态场景下保持高效和质量的并发ANNS索引系统。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential
algorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.
Graph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,
query efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based
indexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the
data after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,
deletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in
applications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently
supports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based
indexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query
quality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to
maintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve
these problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main
components: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to
combat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood
consolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory
cleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the
work spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse
datasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at
least as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding
data. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of
queries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x
throughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency
while maintaining quality under full dynamism.

TL;DR: TIMEST是一种快速、准确的算法，用于估计时态网络中任意大小的时态模体数量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界网络中的边通常带有时间戳，需要时态模体挖掘来分析复杂网络，但现有算法无法高效处理大规模时态模体计数问题。

Method: 提出TIMEST算法，使用时态生成树采样器和加权采样技术，结合随机估计方法，高效计数时态模体。

Result: TIMEST在速度和准确性上均优于现有算法，CPU实现比GPU精确算法快28倍，比近似算法快6倍，误差低于5%。

Conclusion: TIMEST是一种高效、准确的时态模体计数算法，适用于大规模网络分析。

Abstract: The mining of pattern subgraphs, known as motifs, is a core task in the field
of graph mining. Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there
is a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure
that imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have
been used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological
networks.
  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with
millions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge
can occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of
possibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more
than four vertices.
  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation
algorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our
approach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted
sampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method
carefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be
jointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques
to obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.
  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation
guarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show
that TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU
implementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU
implementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate
algorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For
example, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal
motif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two
days.

Motivation: 解决SQL的局限性（如NULL值、阻抗不匹配、SQL注入等），并提供更强大的表达能力和与现代编程语言的集成。

Method: 提出FDM和FQL，通过功能模型和语言设计，实现与编程语言的统一，避免开发者切换编程范式。

Result: FQL比SQL更强大且无缝集成编程语言，优化了编译器与数据库的协作。

Conclusion: FDM和FQL为数据库查询语言提供了更现代、更灵活的解决方案，解决了SQL的长期问题。

Abstract: We propose the vision of a functional data model (FDM) and an associated
functional query language (FQL). Our proposal has far-reaching consequences: we
show a path to come up with a modern QL that solves (almost if not) all
problems of SQL (NULL-values, impedance mismatch, SQL injection, missing
querying capabilities for updates, etc.). FDM and FQL are much more expressive
than the relational model and SQL. In addition, in contrast to SQL, FQL
integrates smoothly into existing programming languages. In our approach both
QL and PL become the "same thing", thus opening up some interesting holistic
optimization opportunities between compilers and databases. In FQL, we also do
not need to force application developers to switch to unfamiliar programming
paradigms (like SQL or datalog): developers can stick with the abstractions
provided by their programming language.

Conclusion: MVIAnalyzer为MVI的复杂问题提供了实用工具，并通过可视化辅助分析。

Abstract: Missing values often limit the usage of data analysis or cause falsification
of results. Therefore, methods of missing value imputation (MVI) are of great
significance. However, in general, there is no universal, fair MVI method for
different tasks. This work thus places MVI in the overall context of data
analysis. For this purpose, we present the MVIAnalyzer, a generic framework for
a holistic analysis of MVI. It considers the overall process up to the
application and analysis of machine learning methods. The associated software
is provided and can be used by other researchers for their own analyses. To
this end, it further includes a missing value simulation with consideration of
relevant parameters. The application of the MVIAnalyzer is demonstrated on data
with different characteristics. An evaluation of the results shows the
possibilities and limitations of different MVI methods. Since MVI is a very
complex topic with different influencing variables, this paper additionally
illustrates how the analysis can be supported by visualizations.

Motivation: 数据流在多种场景中出现（如传感器数据），但现有研究多关注静态数据清洗，而数据流清洗有其特殊性，需深入研究。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，使用原型框架评估数据流清洗的适用性和不一致性。

Result: 实验表明数据流清洗存在不一致性，并提出了流技术在数据清洗中的需求。

Conclusion: 数据流清洗具有特殊性，需进一步研究流技术以满足其需求。

Abstract: Streaming data can arise from a variety of contexts. Important use cases are
continuous sensor measurements such as temperature, light or radiation values.
In the process, streaming data may also contain data errors that should be
cleaned before further use. Many studies from science and practice focus on
data cleaning in a static context. However, in terms of data cleaning,
streaming data has particularities that distinguish it from static data. In
this paper, we have therefore undertaken an intensive exploration of data
cleaning of data streams. We provide a detailed analysis of the applicability
of data cleaning to data streams. Our theoretical considerations are evaluated
in comprehensive experiments. Using a prototype framework, we show that
cleaning is not consistent when working with data streams. An additional
contribution is the investigation of requirements for streaming technologies in
context of data cleaning.

Result: 通过模型量化了简单策略与最优策略之间的性能差距，并研究了多站点系统中状态相关路由的潜在性能优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果为服务提供商在平衡云服务成本和延迟方面提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Cloud computing enables the dynamic provisioning of server resources. To
exploit this opportunity, a policy is needed for dynamically allocating (and
deallocating) servers in response to the current load conditions. In this paper
we describe several simple policies for dynamic server allocation and develop
analytic models for their analysis. We also design semi-Markov decision models
that enable determination of the performance achieved with optimal policies,
allowing us to quantify the performance gap between simple, easily implemented
policies, and optimal policies. Finally, we apply our models to study the
potential performance benefits of state-dependent routing in multi-site systems
when using dynamic server allocation at each site. Insights from our results
are valuable to service providers wanting to balance cloud service costs and
delays.

Motivation: 现有研究常忽略任务间的复杂依赖关系及卸载成本，导致决策次优。

Method: 1. 提出CGG-ARO算法作为单时隙优化基线；2. 设计MA-DDQN框架，结合多智能体协调与多动作选择机制。

Result: CGG-ARO提升任务完成率和总收益约7.1%和7.7%；MA-DDQN进一步提升至11.0%和12.5%。

Conclusion: Oranits在动态ITS环境中实现了更快、更自适应且高效的任务处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open
Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS),
where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient
processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies
between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge
servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission
dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle
cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.
First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,
namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline
for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double
Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and
multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment
time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations
reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall
benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN
achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and
12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient
task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

*Mufakir Qamar Ansari,Mudabir Qamar Ansari*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文通过对比串行、并行CPU和GPU实现的矩阵乘法性能，展示了GPU在大型矩阵运算中的显著加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵乘法是科学计算和机器学习中的基础操作，但其计算复杂度成为大规模应用的瓶颈。研究旨在评估现代异构平台（CPU和GPU）上矩阵乘法的性能表现。

Method: 实现了三种矩阵乘法算法：串行C++、基于OpenMP的多核CPU并行版本和基于CUDA的GPU并行版本，并在不同规模的矩阵上进行了性能测试。

Result: GPU版本在4096x4096矩阵上比串行版本快593倍，比并行CPU版本快45倍，性能随问题规模显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究证明了多核GPU架构在数据并行任务中的巨大潜力，即使是消费级硬件也能实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a foundational operation in scientific computing and
machine learning, yet its computational complexity makes it a significant
bottleneck for large-scale applications. The shift to parallel architectures,
primarily multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs, is the established solution, and
these systems are now ubiquitous from datacenters to consumer laptops. This
paper presents a direct, empirical performance analysis of matrix
multiplication on a modern, consumer-grade heterogeneous platform. We
implemented and benchmarked three versions of the algorithm: a baseline
sequential C++ implementation, a parallel version for its multi-core CPU using
OpenMP, and a massively parallel version for its discrete GPU using CUDA with
shared memory optimizations. The implementations were evaluated with square
matrices of varying dimensions, from 128x128 to 4096x4096. Our results show
that while the parallel CPU provides a consistent speedup of 12-14x over the
sequential version, the GPU's performance scales dramatically with problem
size. For a 4096x4096 matrix, the GPU implementation achieved a speedup of
approximately 593x over the sequential baseline and 45x over the optimized
parallel CPU version. These findings quantitatively demonstrate the profound
impact of many-core GPU architectures on accelerating data-parallel workloads,
underscoring that significant performance gains are readily accessible even on
consumer-level hardware.

Method: MegatronApp引入四个正交且可组合的模块（MegaScan、MegaFBD、MegaDPP、MegaScope），分别针对不同系统级问题。

Result: 这些模块协同工作，显著提升了Megatron-LM生态系统的训练可靠性、效率和透明度。

Conclusion: MegatronApp通过模块化设计有效解决了大规模训练中的系统挑战，为生产级训练提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The rapid escalation in the parameter count of large language models (LLMs)
has transformed model training from a single-node endeavor into a highly
intricate, cross-node activity. While frameworks such as Megatron-LM
successfully integrate tensor (TP), pipeline (PP), and data (DP) parallelism to
enable trillion-parameter training, they simultaneously expose practitioners to
unprecedented systems-level challenges in performance optimization, diagnosis,
and interpretability. MegatronApp is an open-source toolchain expressly
designed to meet these challenges. It introduces four orthogonal, yet
seamlessly composable modules--MegaScan, MegaFBD, MegaDPP, and MegaScope--that
collectively elevate the reliability, efficiency, and transparency of
production-scale training. This paper presents the motivation, architecture,
and distinctive contributions of each module, and elucidates how their
synergistic integration augments the Megatron-LM ecosystem.

### [313] [A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19926)
*Louis Sugy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的中值滤波算法，通过分层分块减少冗余计算，实现了高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中值滤波在图像处理中广泛应用，但传统方法计算成本高，难以扩展。

Method: 利用排序问题的可分性，提出了两种变体：基于寄存器的数据无关选择网络和基于随机存取内存的数据感知版本。

Result: 算法在CUDA实现中比现有技术快5倍，是8、16和32位数据类型的最快中值滤波器。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了中值滤波的效率，适用于多种数据类型的处理。

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for
8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于微服务和边缘计算的云架构，用于实时系统的软件追踪，解决了传统本地工具处理能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时嵌入式系统需要精确的时序和故障检测，但传统追踪工具受限于本地机器的处理能力，难以进行大规模分析。

Method: 采用云架构，将追踪处理任务从开发者的机器转移到云端，利用专用追踪组件通过WebSockets和Apache Kafka传输数据。

Result: 架构支持并行追踪会话的扩展性分析，整体吞吐量增加，但单会话吞吐量随系统负载略有下降。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅适用于开发环境，还可用于具有网络连接的目标系统，实现运行时监控。

Abstract: Real-time embedded systems require precise timing and fault detection to
ensure correct behavior. Traditional tracing tools often rely on local desktops
with limited processing and storage capabilities, which hampers large-scale
analysis. This paper presents a scalable, cloud-based architecture for software
tracing in real-time systems based on microservices and edge computing. Our
approach shifts the trace processing workload from the developer's machine to
the cloud, using a dedicated tracing component that captures trace data and
forwards it to a scalable backend via WebSockets and Apache Kafka. This enables
long-term monitoring and collaborative analysis of target executions, e.g., to
detect and investigate sporadic errors. We demonstrate how this architecture
supports scalable analysis of parallel tracing sessions and lays the foundation
for future integration of rule-based testing and runtime verification. The
evaluation results show that the architecture can handle many parallel tracing
sessions efficiently, although the per-session throughput decreases slightly as
the system load increases, while the overall throughput increases. Although the
design includes a dedicated tracer for analysis during development, this
approach is not limited to such setups. Target systems with network
connectivity can stream reduced trace data directly, enabling runtime
monitoring in the field.

Result: MTASet在范围查询操作中性能提升达2倍，优于现有方案。

Conclusion: MTASet是一种高效且线性一致的并发集合，适用于更新密集型和范围查询场景。

Abstract: In concurrent data structures, the efficiency of set operations can vary
significantly depending on the workload characteristics. Numerous concurrent
set implementations are optimized and fine-tuned to excel in scenarios
characterized by predominant read operations. However, they often perform
poorly when confronted with workloads that heavily prioritize updates.
Additionally, current leading-edge concurrent sets optimized for update-heavy
tasks typically lack efficiency in handling atomic range queries. This study
introduces the MTASet, which leverages a concurrent (a,b)-tree implementation.
Engineered to accommodate update-heavy workloads and facilitate atomic range
queries, MTASet surpasses existing counterparts optimized for tasks in range
query operations by up to 2x. Notably, MTASet ensures linearizability.

Abstract: Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, has revolutionized the digital
economy by enabling decentralized transactions and the execution of smart
contracts. Ethereum transactions form the backbone of its network, facilitating
peer-to-peer exchanges and interactions with complex decentralized
applications. Smart contracts extend Ethereum's capabilities by automating
processes and enabling trustless execution of agreements. Hence, understanding
how these smart contracts interact is important in order to facilitate various
performance optimizations, such as warming objects before they are being
accessed and enabling concurrent execution. Of particular interest to us are
the development of the calling graph, as well as the read sets and write sets
of invocations within the same block, and the properties of the associated
conflict graph that is derived from them. The latter is important for
understanding the parallelization potential of smart contracts on Ethereum. We
traced upwards of 2 million recent Ethereum blocks using call tracer and
prestate tracer, out of a total of 21.4 million blocks at the time of writing.
We report on the transactions per block distribution, the structure of call
trees in smart contract invocations, the ratio of value-transfer transactions
to smart contract invocations, as well as provide a comprehensive study of the
structure of blocks' conflict graphs. We find that conflict graphs
predominantly show a star like configuration, as well as other noteworthy
structural properties.

Motivation: 由于单核处理器的功耗和散热限制，异构计算成为高性能计算的关键，但量化性能和能耗的权衡仍需研究。

Method: 使用标准工具（Linux perf和nvidia-smi）测量4096x4096矩阵乘法在三种架构（AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU、NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU、AMD Radeon Vega GPU）上的性能和能耗。

Result: 独立GPU性能提升93.5倍，能耗仅为CPU的2%，能效提升50倍。

Conclusion: 独立GPU在性能和能效上均表现最佳，为能源感知软件开发提供了明确的量化指导。

Abstract: The paradigm shift towards multi-core and heterogeneous computing, driven by
the fundamental power and thermal limits of single-core processors, has
established energy efficiency as a first-class design constraint in
high-performance computing (HPC). Heterogeneous systems, integrating
traditional multi-core CPUs with specialized accelerators like discrete (dGPU)
and integrated (iGPU) graphics processing units, offer a compelling path to
navigating the trade-offs between performance and power. However, quantifying
these trade-offs on widely accessible hardware remains a critical area of
study. This paper presents a direct, empirical measurement of the performance
and energy-to-solution of a canonical HPC workload -- a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix
multiplication -- on three distinct compute architectures within a single
consumer-grade laptop: a multi-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, a discrete NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, and an integrated AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Using standard,
validated, and minimally intrusive tools such as Linux perf and nvidia-smi, we
find that the discrete GPU is not only the performance leader, achieving a
93.5x speedup over the CPU, but is also the most energy-efficient, consuming
only 2% of the energy used by the CPU, resulting in a 50-fold improvement in
energy efficiency. These findings provide a practical demonstration of the
"race to idle" principle and offer clear, quantitative guidance on
architectural choices for energy-aware software development.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance
parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the
Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the
increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex,
large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for
optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm,
inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for
parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This
study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP
framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts,
scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and
strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to
rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer
insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable
references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking
forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies
at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and
optimization.

Result: 提出了首个在非公平调度器下确保唯一领导者选举的自稳定算法。

Conclusion: 通过粒子运动和网格操作，解决了自稳定领导者选举问题，突破了传统限制。

Abstract: Leader election is a fundamental problem in distributed computing,
particularly within programmable matter systems, where coordination among
simple computational entities is crucial for solving complex tasks. In these
systems, particles (i.e., constant memory computational entities) operate in a
regular triangular grid as described in the geometric Amoebot model. While
leader election has been extensively studied in non self-stabilising settings,
self-stabilising solutions remain more limited. In this work, we study the
problem of self-stabilising leader election in connected (but not necessarily
simply connected) configurations. We present the first self-stabilising
algorithm for programmable matter that guarantees the election of a unique
leader under an unfair scheduler, assuming particles share a common sense of
direction. Our approach leverages particle movement, a capability not
previously exploited in the self-stabilising context. We show that movement in
conjunction with particles operating in a grid can overcome classical
impossibility results for constant-memory systems established by Dolev et al.

Result: 强化学习方法能学习高性能调度决策，但需大量探索；专家方法依赖先验知识但可能非最优。结合两者可改进性能。

Conclusion: 动态选择调度算法在OpenMP中可行且有益，并可扩展至MPI程序，优化多级并行调度。

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex,
with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance
computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across
nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling
and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks
such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support
diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling
algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable
algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling
algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across
six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are
capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require
significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.
Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less
exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a
specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based
learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling
algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP
applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling
optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构系统中多样化的计算架构和动态任务映射使内存管理变得复杂，现有方法需显式管理或假设静态映射，限制了可移植性和扩展性。

Method: RIMMS通过透明跟踪数据位置、管理一致性和高效内存分配，解耦应用开发与底层内存操作，无需平台特定调整。

Result: 在CPU+GPU和CPU+FPGA平台上，RIMMS分别实现2.43倍和1.82倍加速，性能接近原生CUDA实现，且编程复杂度显著降低。

Conclusion: RIMMS在动态异构环境中实现了高性能和程序员生产力提升，同时仅引入极低开销。

Abstract: Efficient memory management in heterogeneous systems is increasingly
challenging due to diverse compute architectures (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA) and
dynamic task mappings not known at compile time. Existing approaches often
require programmers to manage data placement and transfers explicitly, or
assume static mappings that limit portability and scalability. This paper
introduces RIMMS (Runtime Integrated Memory Management System), a lightweight,
runtime-managed, hardware-agnostic memory abstraction layer that decouples
application development from low-level memory operations. RIMMS transparently
tracks data locations, manages consistency, and supports efficient memory
allocation across heterogeneous compute elements without requiring
platform-specific tuning or code modifications. We integrate RIMMS into a
baseline runtime and evaluate with complete radar signal processing
applications across CPU+GPU and CPU+FPGA platforms. RIMMS delivers up to 2.43X
speedup on GPU-based and 1.82X on FPGA-based systems over the baseline.
Compared to IRIS, a recent heterogeneous runtime system, RIMMS achieves up to
3.08X speedup and matches the performance of native CUDA implementations while
significantly reducing programming complexity. Despite operating at a higher
abstraction level, RIMMS incurs only 1-2 cycles of overhead per memory
management call, making it a low-cost solution. These results demonstrate
RIMMS's ability to deliver high performance and enhanced programmer
productivity in dynamic, real-world heterogeneous environments.

in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs)
and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we
systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth,
diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's
properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator
fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between
measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor
localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments,
solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On
the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple
greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for
various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated
data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while
staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and
credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully
capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable,
high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个四维分类框架，用于量化现代智能应用中的信息质量需求，并探讨了人工智能技术在优化信息质量目标中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络指标（如延迟和数据包丢失）无法满足现代智能应用对信息质量的复杂需求，因此需要新的度量框架。

Method: 引入了一个系统的四维分类框架（时间、质量/效用、可靠性/稳健性、网络/通信），并分析了人工智能技术在优化这些维度中的作用。

Result: 研究发现，人工智能技术能够自适应地优化信息质量目标，并在六个关键应用领域中展示了多维信息指标的潜力。

Conclusion: 多维信息指标对满足多样化操作需求具有革命性意义，但实现过程中仍面临显著挑战。

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted
from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs
that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information,
rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency
and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the
nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications,
including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In
this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of
Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic
framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility,
reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the
increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness
triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal,
ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that
artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning,
multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive,
context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our
extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous
transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications,
LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise
of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.
Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

Motivation: 传统方法（如手动测试和静态优化）未能充分考虑用户密度、地形特征和财务约束等现实因素，导致网络扩展效果不佳。

Method: 结合深度神经网络预测信号覆盖范围，利用空间聚类推荐新基站位置，并整合地理空间、人口统计和基础设施数据，同时考虑预算约束。

Result: 框架具有模块化、鲁棒性和通用性，能够适应不同部署场景，提供数据驱动的网络扩展方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为无线电网络规划提供了可扩展、数据驱动的替代方案，优于传统手动方法。

Abstract: Network capacity expansion is a critical challenge for telecom operators,
requiring strategic placement of new cell sites to ensure optimal coverage and
performance. Traditional approaches, such as manual drive tests and static
optimization, often fail to consider key real-world factors including user
density, terrain features, and financial constraints. In this paper, we propose
a machine learning-based framework that combines deep neural networks for
signal coverage prediction with spatial clustering to recommend new tower
locations in underserved areas. The system integrates geospatial, demographic,
and infrastructural data, and incorporates budget-aware constraints to
prioritize deployments. Operating within an iterative planning loop, the
framework refines coverage estimates after each proposed installation, enabling
adaptive and cost-effective expansion. While full-scale simulation was limited
by data availability, the architecture is modular, robust to missing inputs,
and generalizable across diverse deployment scenarios. This approach advances
radio network planning by offering a scalable, data-driven alternative to
manual methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种静态选择最优扩频因子（SF）的两阶段算法，以解决低成本单通道LoRa网关在移动部署中缺乏动态配置支持的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本单通道LoRa网关在移动部署中难以实现可靠通信，而传统LoRaWAN的动态配置功能仅适用于昂贵的多通道网关。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：首先基于规则排除不满足距离、数据速率等约束的SF，然后通过加权评分模型评估剩余候选SF。

Result: 在672个模拟场景中，92%的情况下所选SF与最优SF匹配，验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法为成本敏感环境（如农业和农村传感应用）提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，实现了可靠的移动LoRa部署。

Abstract: The deployment of mobile LoRa gateways using low-cost single-channel hardware
presents a significant challenge in maintaining reliable communication due to
the lack of dynamic configuration support. In traditional LoRaWAN networks,
Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanisms optimize communication parameters in real
time. However, such features are typically supported only by expensive
multi-channel gateways. This study proposes a cost-effective and
energy-efficient solution by statically selecting the optimal Spreading Factor
(SF) using a two-phase algorithm. The method first applies rule-based exclusion
to eliminate SFs that violate constraints related to distance, data rate, link
margin, and regulatory limits. Remaining candidates are then evaluated using a
weighted scoring model incorporating Time-on-Air, energy consumption, data
rate, and link robustness. The proposed algorithm was validated through
extensive field tests and NS-3 simulations under line-of-sight conditions.
Results demonstrate that the selected SF matched the optimal SF in over 92% of
cases across 672 simulated scenarios, confirming the algorithm's effectiveness.
This approach offers a scalable alternative to dynamic protocols, enabling
reliable mobile LoRa deployments in cost-sensitive environments such as
agriculture and rural sensing applications.

The Hera framework integrates application-aware streaming logic with a

Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法难以捕捉新兴DDoS攻击的复杂时空模式，导致生成数据与真实数据相似度不足，影响机器学习模型的检测效果。

Method: 提出DSTF-Diffusion模型，包含两个主要流：场流通过空间映射将网络数据特征与预训练的稳定扩散模型结合；时空流采用动态时间建模方法捕捉网络流量的内在时间模式。

Result: 实验表明，该模型生成的合成数据在统计上更接近真实数据，并在多种下游任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: DSTF-Diffusion为DDoS攻击检测提供了更高质量的合成数据生成方法，显著提升了机器学习模型的检测准确性。

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research
efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose
effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To
address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces
is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle
to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in
emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces
and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we
propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view,
multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models,
featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge
network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion
models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that
stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic
temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal
patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data
generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals
compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a
wide range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究DAO治理机制中用户行为的动态变化，特别是SNS框架下的表现，以评估其效率和可持续性。

Method: 分析了14个SNS DAO在20个月内的3,000多个提案，测量了参与率、提案提交频率、投票通过率和决策时长等指标。

Result: SNS DAO表现出更高的活跃度、更低的成本和更快的决策速度，且用户参与度随时间持续增长，与其他框架的DAO相比更具优势。

Conclusion: SNS框架的治理机制在DAO中表现优异，能够维持或提升用户参与度，具有较高的实用性和可持续性。

Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rely on governance mechanism
without centralized leadership. This paper presents an empirical study of user
behavior in governance for a variety of DAOs, ranging from DeFi to gaming,
using the Internet Computer Protocol DAO framework called SNS (Service Nervous
System). To analyse user engagement, we measure participation rates and
frequency of proposals submission and voter approval rates. We evaluate
decision duration times to determine DAO agility. To investigate dynamic
aspects, we also measure metric shifts in time. We evaluate over 3,000
proposals submitted in a time frame of 20 months from 14 SNS DAOs. The selected
DAO have been existing between 6 and 20 months and cover a wide spectrum of use
cases, treasury sizes, and number of participants. We also compare our results
for SNS DAOs with DAOs from other blockchain platforms. While approval rates
are generally high for all DAOs studied, SNS DAOs show slightly more alignment.
We observe that the SNS governance mechanisms and processes in ICP lead to
higher activity, lower costs and faster decisions. Most importantly, in
contrast to studies which report a decline in participation over time for other
frameworks, SNS DAOs exhibit sustained or increasing engagement levels over
time.

Result: 混合光纤/FSO部署相比全光纤网络可显著节省成本，同时提高服务覆盖概率、能效和成本效率。

Conclusion: 通过合理的网络规划，可以同时提升IAB网络的服务覆盖、能效和成本效率。

Abstract: Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is one of the promising techniques for
5G networks and beyond (6G), in which the same node/hardware is used to provide
both backhaul and cellular services in a multi-hop architecture. Due to the
sensitivity of the backhaul links with high rate/reliability demands, proper
network planning is needed to ensure the IAB network performs with the desired
performance levels. In this paper, we study the effect of infrastructure
planning and optimization on the coverage of IAB networks. We concentrate on
the cases where the fiber connectivity to the nodes is constrained due to cost.
Thereby, we study the performance gains and energy efficiency in the presence
of free-space optical (FSO) communication links. Our results indicate hybrid
fiber/FSO deployments offer substantial cost savings compared to fully fibered
networks, suggesting a beneficial trade-off for strategic link deployment while
improving the service coverage probability. As we show, with proper network
planning, the service coverage, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency can be
improved.

a systematic feasibility study of AV teleoperation over commercial 5G networks
from both cross-layer and end-to-end (E2E) perspectives. Given the critical
importance of timely delivery of sensor data, such as camera and LiDAR data,

Result: DD-JSCC在图像重建中PSNR提升2 dB，训练成本降低40%。

Conclusion: DD-JSCC通过统一框架解决了传统方法的局限性，显著降低了训练和部署复杂度。

Abstract: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (Deep-JSCC) has emerged as a promising
semantic communication approach for wireless image transmission by jointly
optimizing source and channel coding using deep learning techniques. However,
traditional Deep-JSCC architectures employ fixed encoder-decoder structures,
limiting their adaptability to varying device capabilities, real-time
performance optimization, power constraints and channel conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose DD-JSCC: Dynamic Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding
for Semantic Communications, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed for
semantic communication systems. Unlike traditional Deep-JSCC models, DD-JSCC is
flexible for dynamically adjusting its layer structures in real-time based on
transmitter and receiver capabilities, power constraints, compression ratios,
and current channel conditions. This adaptability is achieved through a
hierarchical layer activation mechanism combined with implicit regularization
via sequential randomized training, effectively reducing combinatorial
complexity, preventing overfitting, and ensuring consistent feature
representations across varying configurations. Simulation results demonstrate
that DD-JSCC enhances the performance of image reconstruction in semantic
communications, achieving up to 2 dB improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR) over fixed Deep-JSCC architectures, while reducing training costs by
over 40%. The proposed unified framework eliminates the need for multiple
specialized models, significantly reducing training complexity and deployment
overhead.

Abstract: Low altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to facilitate the
development of aerial-ground integrated intelligent transportation systems and
unlocking the potential of the emerging low-altitude economy. However, several
critical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network
resources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel
state information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude
economy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything
communication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we
formulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control,
and flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI
feedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV
communication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint.
To this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original
long-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then
propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm,
which innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel
allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions. Through
extensive simulations using real-world vehicle mobility traces, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed D3PG algorithm compared to existing
benchmark solutions.

Motivation: 随着互联网用户隐私需求的增长，DNS隐私长期被忽视。现有解决方案如DoH和ODoH依赖非共谋假设，难以实际保证。

Method: 提出PDNS，利用单服务器PIR技术加密DNS查询，避免信任假设，并处理递归解析器的信息泄露问题。

Result: 实验表明，PDNS性能可接受（比Tor上的DoH快2倍），隐私保障强，但扩展性受限。

Conclusion: PDNS在当前提供了高性能和强隐私保障，未来可通过专用硬件解决扩展性问题。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in Internet user privacy, demonstrated by
the popularity of privacy-preserving products such as Telegram and Brave, and
the widespread adoption of HTTPS. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a key
component of Internet-based communication and its privacy has been neglected
for years. Recently, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has improved the situation by fixing
the issue of in-path middleboxes. Further progress has been made with
proxy-based solutions such as Oblivious DoH (ODoH), which separate a user's
identity from their DNS queries. However, these solutions rely on non-collusion
assumptions between DNS resolvers and proxies -- an assumption difficult to
guarantee in practice. To address this, we explore integrating single-server
Private Information Retrieval (PIR) into DNS to enable encrypted query
processing without relying on trust assumptions. However, applying PIR to DNS
is challenging due to its hierarchical nature -- particularly, interactions
with recursive resolvers can still leak information. Navigating performance and
privacy trade-offs, we propose PDNS, a DNS extension leveraging single-server
PIR to strengthen privacy guarantees. We have implemented a prototype of PDNS
and compared its performance against state-of-the-art solutions via
trace-driven experiments. The results show that PDNS achieves acceptable
performance (2x faster than DoH over Tor with similar privacy guarantees) and
strong privacy guarantees today, mainly at the cost of its scalability, which
specialized hardware for PIR can address in the near future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中支持原生AI的关键目标，联邦学习（FL）作为一种隐私保护的分布式学习范式受到关注，但数据异构性和频繁客户端参与带来了收敛慢、精度低和资源负担等问题。

Method: 提出FedABC算法，基于注意力机制评估客户端模型相似性和独特贡献，动态调整选择阈值，优化参与策略。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的实验显示，FedABC比经典算法FedAvg减少32%的客户端参与，精度提高3.5%，且比现有最优方法减少2%的客户端参与。

Conclusion: FedABC为异构资源受限环境中的联邦学习提供了高效解决方案，支持6G网络的原生AI能力。

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with
Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows
decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly
sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private
data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the
global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data
heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client
participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection
algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and
optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms,
\textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model
similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover,
considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an
optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process.
Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts
the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later
training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that
\textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy
and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\%
fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher
accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a
step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments,

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应的网络数字孪生（NDT）架构，旨在处理流量波动并优化虚拟孪生（VTwin）与物理孪生（PTwin）的同步，通过实时监测和概念漂移检测技术提升延迟预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络数字孪生需要实时感知物理孪生的变化以实现同步，但现有研究对流量波动下的NDT弹性和同步优化关注不足。

Method: 提出了一种自适应的NDT架构，结合遥测模块监测流量，利用概念漂移检测技术指导VTwin的重新训练和部署。

Result: 在多种网络拓扑和流量模式下，该架构在流量概念漂移后，延迟预测性能提升了至少56.7%。

Conclusion: 该架构显著提升了NDT在流量波动下的预测性能和同步能力，为网络管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability of the network digital twin (NDT) to remain aware of changes in
its physical counterpart, known as the physical twin (PTwin), is a fundamental
condition to enable timely synchronization, also referred to as twinning. In
this way, considering a transport network, a key requirement is to handle
unexpected traffic variability and dynamically adapt to maintain optimal
performance in the associated virtual model, known as the virtual twin (VTwin).
In this context, we propose a self-adaptive implementation of a novel NDT
architecture designed to provide accurate delay predictions, even under
fluctuating traffic conditions. This architecture addresses an essential
challenge, underexplored in the literature: improving the resilience of
data-driven NDT platforms against traffic variability and improving
synchronization between the VTwin and its physical counterpart. Therefore, the
contributions of this article rely on NDT lifecycle by focusing on the
operational phase, where telemetry modules are used to monitor incoming
traffic, and concept drift detection techniques guide retraining decisions
aimed at updating and redeploying the VTwin when necessary. We validate our
architecture with a network management use case, across various emulated
network topologies, and diverse traffic patterns to demonstrate its
effectiveness in preserving acceptable performance and predicting per-flow
delay under unexpected traffic variation. The results in all tested topologies,
using the normalized mean square error as the evaluation metric, demonstrate
that our proposed architecture, after a traffic concept drift, achieves a
performance improvement in prediction of at least 56.7% compared to a
configuration without NDT synchronization.

Motivation: 为编程学习者提供个性化的练习内容，适应不同技能水平的学习需求。

Method: 利用CONTINUOUS本体跨语言概念，结合Elo评分系统动态调整练习难度，并进行自适应与随机模式的实验比较。

Result: 自适应模式在正确率和通过概念数上显著优于随机模式。

Conclusion: ADVENTURE系统能有效支持编程学习者的练习需求。

Abstract: This paper introduces an ontology-based approach within an adaptive learning
support system for computer programming. This system (named ADVENTURE) is
designed to deliver personalized programming exercises that are tailored to
individual learners' skill levels. ADVENTURE utilizes an ontology, named
CONTINUOUS, which encompasses common concepts across multiple programming
languages. The system leverages this ontology not only to visualize programming
concepts but also to provide hints during practice programming exercises and
recommend subsequent programming concepts. The adaptive mechanism is driven by
the Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically
estimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An
experimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based
on six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental
groups. The results indicate significant differences in four of six analyzed
features between these two modes. Notably, the adaptive mode demonstrates a
significant difference over the random mode in two features, the submission of
correct answers and the number of pass concepts. Therefore, these results
underscore that this adaptive learning support system may support learners in
practicing programming exercises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高阶逻辑编程中阶数与非确定性之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过良基语义和稳定模型语义分析高阶Datalog¬的表达能力，并利用部分应用关系和关系枚举进行证明。

Result: 在良基语义下，(k+1)-阶Datalog¬捕获k-EXP；在稳定模型语义下，捕获co-(k-NEXP)和k-NEXP。

Conclusion: 高阶Datalog¬的表达能力随阶数增加而提升，揭示了阶数与非确定性之间的权衡。

Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of Higher-Order Datalog$^\neg$ under both
the well-founded and the stable model semantics, establishing tight connections
with complexity classes. We prove that under the well-founded semantics, for
all $k\geq 1$, $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures k-EXP, a result that holds
without explicit ordering of the input database. The proof of this fact can be
performed either by using the powerful existential predicate variables of the
language or by using partially applied relations and relation enumeration.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this expressive power is retained within a
stratified fragment of the language. Under the stable model semantics, we show
that $(k+1)$-Order Datalog$^\neg$ captures co-(k-NEXP) using cautious reasoning
and k-NEXP using brave reasoning, again with analogous results for the
stratified fragment augmented with choice rules. Our results establish a
hierarchy of expressive power, highlighting an interesting trade-off between
order and non-determinism in the context of higher-order logic programming:
increasing the order of programs under the well-founded semantics can surpass
the expressive power of lower-order programs under the stable model semantics.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动检测和修复网页可访问性违规的方法AccessGuru，结合现有工具和大语言模型，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数网页不符合可访问性指南，导致部分用户无法使用。手动修复成本高，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出分类法将违规分为语法、语义和布局三类，结合现有工具和LLM检测并修复。

Result: AccessGuru在基准测试中平均违规分数降低84%，显著优于现有方法（最多50%）。

Conclusion: AccessGuru有效解决了网页可访问性违规问题，为自动化修复提供了新方向。

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web
accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities
from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users
requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page
providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to
automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.
While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of
accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting
accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We
introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three
key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a
structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and
redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which
combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to
correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a
benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies
syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through
comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our
benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score
decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

*Joao Pedro Duarte,Paulo Borba,Guilherme Cavalcanti*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LastMerge是一种通用的结构化合并工具，通过简化配置接口提高合并准确性，实验表明其性能与语言特定工具相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决结构化合并工具因语言特定性和高成本而难以广泛应用的问题。

Method: 提出LastMerge，并通过实验比较其与语言特定工具（jDime、Spork）及其通用版本（Mergiraf）的性能和准确性。

Result: 通用工具在准确性上与语言特定工具无显著差异，LastMerge减少15%误报，Mergiraf减少42%漏报。

Conclusion: 通用结构化合并工具可替代语言特定工具，推动其在工业中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Unstructured line-based merge tools are widely used in practice. Structured
AST-based merge tools show significantly improved merge accuracy, but are
rarely used in practice because they are language specific and costly,
consequently not being available for many programming languages. To improve
merge accuracy for a wide range of languages, we propose LastMerge, a generic
structured merge tool that can be configured through a thin interface that
significantly reduces the effort of supporting structured merge. To understand
the impact that generic structured merge might have on merge accuracy and
performance, we run an experiment with four structured merge tools: two Java
specific tools, jDime and Spork, and their generic counterparts, respectively
LastMerge and Mergiraf. Using each tool, we replay merge scenarios from a
significant dataset, and collect data on runtime, behavioral divergences, and
merge accuracy. Our results show no evidence that generic structured merge
significantly impacts merge accuracy. Although we observe a difference rate of
approximately 10% between the Java specific tools and their generic
counterparts, most of the differences stem from implementation details and
could be avoided. We find that LastMerge reports 15% fewer false positives than
jDime while Mergiraf misses 42% fewer false negatives than Spork. Both generic
tools exhibit comparable runtime performance to the state of the art language
specific implementations. These results suggest that generic structured merge
tools can effectively replace language-specific ones, paving the way for
broader adoption of structured merge in industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JIT-DP研究忽视代码重构及其传播，导致模型学习和评估存在偏差。

Method: 提出Code chAnge Tactics (CAT)分析，分类代码重构及其传播，并改进数据集标注。

Result: 忽略重构信息会降低模型性能（F1-score下降18.6%-37.3%），而整合重构信息可提升召回率和F1-score（最高43.2%和32.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究强调重构信息对JIT-DP的重要性，CAT方法在软件维护中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Just-in-time defect prediction (JIT-DP) aims to predict the likelihood of
code changes resulting in software defects at an early stage. Although code
change metrics and semantic features have enhanced prediction accuracy, prior
research has largely ignored code refactoring during both the evaluation and
methodology phases, despite its prevalence. Refactoring and its propagation
often tangle with bug-fixing and bug-inducing changes within the same commit
and statement. Neglecting refactoring can introduce bias into the learning and
evaluation of JIT-DP models. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of
refactoring and its propagation on six state-of-the-art JIT-DP approaches. We
propose Code chAnge Tactics (CAT) analysis to categorize code refactoring and
its propagation, which improves labeling accuracy in the JIT-Defects4J dataset
by 13.7%. Our experiments reveal that failing to consider refactoring
information in the dataset can diminish the performance of models, particularly
semantic-based models, by 18.6% and 37.3% in F1-score. Additionally, we propose
integrating refactoring information to enhance six baseline approaches,
resulting in overall improvements in recall and F1-score, with increases of up
to 43.2% and 32.5%, respectively. Our research underscores the importance of
incorporating refactoring information in the methodology and evaluation of
JIT-DP. Furthermore, our CAT has broad applicability in analyzing refactoring
and its propagation for software maintenance.

TL;DR: NullRepair是一个结合LLM的系统，用于自动化修复Java代码中的nullability错误，通过结构化工作流程和静态分析提高修复准确性和上下文理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Java项目广泛使用静态分析工具防止空指针异常，但集成到大型代码库仍具挑战性，手动修复残余错误繁琐且易错。

Method: NullRepair通过流程图决策流程、静态分析识别符号安全使用区域，并利用LLM迭代生成修复补丁，结合项目全局上下文。

Result: 在12个真实Java项目中，NullRepair平均修复72%的残余错误，且保持程序语义，10/12项目通过全部单元测试。

Conclusion: NullRepair有效解决了nullability错误的自动化修复问题，显著优于直接使用LLM的方法。

Abstract: Modern Java projects increasingly adopt static analysis tools that prevent
null-pointer exceptions by treating nullness as a type property. However,
integrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant
challenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,
a subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives
-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing
these errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often
generate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability
error demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,
often spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system
that integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a
nullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived
from manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to
identify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage
examples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an
iterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and
decision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that
NullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying
a state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted
LLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests
passing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and
98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects.

Abstract: Reliability prediction is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of
software systems, especially in the context of industry practices. While
various metrics and measurements are employed to assess software reliability,
the complexity of modern systems necessitates a deeper understanding of how
these metrics interact with security and safety concerns. This paper explores
the interplay between software reliability, safety, and security, offering a
comprehensive analysis of key metrics and measurement techniques used in the
industry for reliability prediction. We identify critical threats to software
reliability and provide a threat estimation framework that incorporates both
safety and security aspects. Our findings suggest that integrating reliability
metrics with safety and security considerations can enhance the robustness of
software systems. Furthermore, we propose a set of actionable guidelines for
practitioners to improve their reliability prediction models while
simultaneously addressing the security and safety challenges of contemporary
software applications.

Conclusion: 研究呼吁关注ES-CodeGen中的伦理问题，并强调了社会相关维度的重要性。

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and
effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are
growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing,
privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching
goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing
attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we
introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to
refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development
from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices.
To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review
where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code
generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of
ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of
ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who
submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users
have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation
models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension
on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified
consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey
reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related
dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or
strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen.
Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

Method: FreeLog采用系统无关的表示元学习方法，无需目标系统标记日志。

Result: 在三个公开日志数据集上，FreeLog性能与依赖少量标记数据的最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: FreeLog为零标签跨系统日志异常检测提供了可行方案，解决了冷启动问题。

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large
amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world
applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified
as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve
promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However,
their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start
problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we
explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly
detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we
propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that
eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log
anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three
public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the
target system.

Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of
steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The
construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge
artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations.
The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders

Motivation: 传统软件开发需要多方协作，而AgentMesh旨在通过多代理系统自动化这一复杂过程。

Method: 框架包含四个专门代理：Planner（规划）、Coder（编码）、Debugger（调试）和Reviewer（审查），它们协同工作将需求转化为代码。

Result: 案例研究表明，AgentMesh能通过任务分解、代码生成、调试和审查处理复杂开发请求。

Conclusion: 多代理分工合作能发挥LLM优势并减少单代理限制，但仍有错误传播和上下文扩展等挑战需解决。

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally
requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose
AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered
agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents
- a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a
high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first
decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements
each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the
Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We
describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,
and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow
orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial
development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative
debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities
among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while
mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations -
such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward
more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering
automation.

Result: 评估了14个通用LLM和6个代码专用LLM，结果显示即使是表现最佳的模型在CPL场景中也表现不佳。

Conclusion: CrossPL揭示了LLM在跨语言代码生成上的不足，呼吁更多针对性研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software
engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating
correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability.
This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components
written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication
(IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code.
CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used
programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct
this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using
156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based
pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task
instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the
past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even
the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need
for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的技术，通过动态分析NoSQL数据库状态和直接从测试用例插入数据，显著提高了RESTful API白盒测试的代码覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RESTful API测试中，数据库状态对提高代码覆盖率和发现隐藏故障至关重要，但传统方法难以高效处理NoSQL数据库状态。

Method: 通过自动化代码插桩动态分析MongoDB数据库状态，并允许从测试用例直接插入NoSQL数据。

Result: 在六个RESTful API上的实验显示，代码覆盖率提高了18%，优于现有白盒和四种黑盒模糊测试工具。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了测试效果，特别适用于处理复杂数据库状态和只读微服务的测试场景。

Abstract: In RESTful APIs, interactions with a database are a common and crucial
aspect. When generating whitebox tests, it is essential to consider the
database's state (i.e., the data contained in the database) to achieve higher
code coverage and uncover more hidden faults. This article presents novel
techniques to enhance search-based software test generation for RESTful APIs
interacting with NoSQL databases. Specifically, we target the popular MongoDB
database, by dynamically analyzing (via automated code instrumentation) the
state of the database during the test generation process. Additionally, to
achieve better results, our novel approach allows inserting NoSQL data directly
from test cases. This is particularly beneficial when generating the correct
sequence of events to set the NoSQL database in an appropriate state is
challenging or time-consuming. This method is also advantageous for testing
read-only microservices. Our novel techniques are implemented as an extension
of EvoMaster, the only open-source tool for white-box fuzzing RESTful APIs.
Experiments conducted on six RESTful APIs demonstrated significant improvements
in code coverage, with increases of up to 18% compared to existing white-box
approaches. To better highlight the improvements of our novel techniques,
comparisons are also carried out with four state-of-the-art black-box fuzzers.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.
  Keywords: large language models, automated program repair,

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Prometheus是一个多代理系统，通过将代码库转换为知识图谱来解决多语言存储库中的实际问题，超越了现有方法的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于Python问题且依赖预构建容器，Prometheus旨在解决多语言存储库中的实际问题。

Method: 将代码库转换为统一知识图谱，支持多种编程语言，使用Neo4j进行图持久化，并集成DeepSeek-V3模型。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite和SWE-bench Multilingual上分别解决了28.67%和13.7%的问题，成本低且首次支持七种语言。

Conclusion: Prometheus在多语言环境中表现优异，并能解决实际GitHub问题，已开源。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents, such as SWE-agent and OpenHands, have made
progress toward automated issue resolution. However, existing approaches are
often limited to Python-only issues and rely on pre-constructed containers in
SWE-bench with reproduced issues, restricting their applicability to real-world
and work for multi-language repositories. We present Prometheus, designed to
resolve real-world issues beyond benchmark settings. Prometheus is a
multi-agent system that transforms an entire code repository into a unified
knowledge graph to guide context retrieval for issue resolution. Prometheus
encodes files, abstract syntax trees, and natural language text into a graph of
typed nodes and five general edge types to support multiple programming
languages. Prometheus uses Neo4j for graph persistence, enabling scalable and
structured reasoning over large codebases. Integrated by the DeepSeek-V3 model,
Prometheus resolves 28.67% and 13.7% of issues on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench
Multilingual, respectively, with an average API cost of $0.23 and $0.38 per
issue. Prometheus resolves 10 unique issues not addressed by prior work and is
the first to demonstrate effectiveness across seven programming languages.
Moreover, it shows the ability to resolve real-world GitHub issues in the
LangChain and OpenHands repositories. We have open-sourced Prometheus at:

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PDLogger是一种端到端的日志生成技术，针对多日志场景设计，显著提升了日志位置、级别、变量和消息的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化日志技术仅关注单一子任务（如日志位置、级别或消息），无法生成完整且高质量的日志语句，且忽略了方法间的语义依赖。

Method: PDLogger分为三阶段：日志位置预测（基于块类型提示的LLM）、日志生成（利用程序切片和变量提取的上下文）、日志优化（级别校正和去重）。

Result: 在3113条日志上的实验显示，PDLogger在日志位置、级别、变量和消息质量上均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: PDLogger是一种高效、通用的日志生成框架，适用于实际多日志场景，并开源以促进研究和应用。

Abstract: Logging is indispensable for maintaining the reliability and diagnosability
of modern software, yet developers still struggle to decide where and how to
log effectively. Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated
sub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore
cannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world
practice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also
neglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow
set of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this
paper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique
expressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in
three phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts
guide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all
control-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing
supplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an
expanded variable extractor captures both member and external function
expressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement
(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and
context-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs. We
evaluate PDLogger on 3,113 log statements drawn from two widely used Java
projects. Compared with the strongest prior systems, PDLogger improves
log-position precision by 139.0 percent, F1 by 69.2 percent, level accuracy by
82.3 percent, variable precision by 131.8 percent, and message quality
(BERTScore) by 65.7 percent. The framework consistently performs well with
different mainstream LLMs, demonstrating robustness and generality. PDLogger's
implementation is available as open source to foster future research and
adoption.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了指针分析在语义冲突静态分析中的作用，发现虽然减少了误报和超时，但增加了漏报，建议探索混合分析技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合并工具无法检测语义冲突，且静态分析方法误报率高，希望通过指针分析改进。

Method: 实现带和不带指针分析的相同分析，对比其在两个数据集上的准确性、计算性能和差异。

Result: 指针分析显著减少误报和超时，但漏报增加，召回率和F1分数下降。

Conclusion: 建议在语义冲突检测中探索结合两种实现优点的混合分析技术。

Abstract: Current merge tools don't detect semantic conflicts, which occur when changes
from different developers are textually integrated but semantically interfere
with each other. Although researchers have proposed static analyses for
detecting semantic conflicts, these analyses suffer from significant false
positive rates. To understand whether such false positives could be reduced by
using pointer analysis in the implementation of semantic conflict static
analyses, we conduct an empirical study. We implement the same analysis with
and without pointer analysis, run them on two datasets, observe how often they
differ, and compare their accuracy and computational performance. Although
pointer analysis is known to improve precision in static analysis, we find that
its effect on semantic conflict detection can be drastic: we observe a
significant reduction in timeouts and false positives, but also a significant
increase in false negatives, with prohibitive drops in recall and F1-score.
These results suggest that, in the context of semantic conflict detection, we
should explore hybrid analysis techniques, combining aspects of both
implementations we compare in our study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一CI服务，缺乏对多服务采用及迁移的全面理解。

Method: 通过历史数据分析18,924个Java项目对8种CI服务的采用模式。

Result: 近五分之一项目采用多CI服务，且常伴随服务迁移。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多CI服务采用的普遍性，为未来研究和工具开发提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) services, such as GitHub Actions and Travis CI,
are widely adopted in open-source development to automate testing and
deployment. Though existing research often examines individual services in
isolation, it remains unclear how projects adopt and transition between
multiple services over time. To understand how CI adoption is evolving across
services, we present a preliminary study analyzing the historical CI adoption
of 18,924 Java projects hosted on GitHub between January 2008 and December
2024, adopting at least one of eight CI services, namely Travis CI, AppVeyor,
CircleCI, Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Bitbucket, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI.
Specifically, we investigate: (1) how frequently CI services are co-adopted or
replaced, and (2) how maintenance activity varies across different services.
Our analysis shows that the use of multiple CI services within the same project
is a recurring pattern observed in nearly one in five projects, often
reflecting migration across CI services. Our study is among the first to
examine multi-CI adoption in practice, offering new insights for future
research and highlighting the need for strategies and tools to support service
selection, coordination, and migration in evolving CI environments.

Motivation: 探索SFT和DPO在不同代码偏好场景下的最优训练策略，解决模型对齐问题。

Method: 结合理论分析和实验观察，提出APO方法，动态调整训练策略。

Result: APO在六项代码偏好任务中表现优于或匹配现有SFT和S&D策略。

Conclusion: APO为不同代码偏好对齐场景提供了理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear
across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically
investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code
preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we
hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal
solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore
superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal
solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive
Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively
amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages
exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive
experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our
theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or
surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides
both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate
training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物信息学工作流系统（如Galaxy和Nextflow）的复杂性使得非编程专家难以使用，研究旨在探索大型语言模型是否能帮助生成准确、完整且可用的工作流。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5 Flash和DeepSeek-V3在多种任务（如SNP分析、RNA-seq等）中的表现，并与社区基准进行比较。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash在Galaxy工作流生成中表现最佳，DeepSeek-V3在Nextflow中表现优异，提示策略显著影响质量。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型有望降低工作流开发门槛，提高可重复性，尤其是在结合有效提示策略时。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of bioinformatics data analysis has made Scientific
Workflow Systems (SWSs) like Galaxy and Nextflow essential for enabling
scalable, reproducible, and automated workflows. However, creating and
understanding these workflows remains challenging, particularly for domain
experts without programming expertise. This study investigates whether modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, can
support the generation of accurate, complete, and usable bioinformatics
workflows, and examines which prompting strategies most effectively guide this
process. We evaluate these models using diverse tasks such as SNP analysis,
RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and data retrieval, spanning both graphical (Galaxy)
and script-based (Nextflow) platforms. Expert reviewers assess the generated
workflows against community-curated baselines from the Galaxy Training Network
and nf-core repositories. The results show that Gemini 2.5 Flash excels in
generating Galaxy workflows, while DeepSeek-V3 performs strongly in Nextflow.
Prompting strategies significantly impact quality, with role-based and
chain-of-thought prompts improving completeness and correctness. While GPT-4o
benefits from structured inputs, DeepSeek-V3 offers rich technical detail,
albeit with some verbosity. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of
LLMs to lower the barrier for workflow development, improve reproducibility,
and democratize access to computational tools in bioinformatics, especially
when combined with thoughtful prompt engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在航空应用中，机器学习模型的性能指标与系统安全目标之间的关系不明确，需要一种方法将两者联系起来。

Method: 通过一个飞机紧急制动系统的例子，抽象出MLC的行为，并基于此推导出安全相关的性能要求和指标。

Result: 提出了一种初始方法，确保MLC及其神经网络满足定量安全目标，并讨论了方法的有效性和适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为航空应用中机器学习模型的性能要求与安全目标之间的联系提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The prediction quality of machine learnt models and the functionality they
ultimately enable (e.g., object detection), is typically evaluated using a
variety of quantitative metrics that are specified in the associated model
performance requirements. When integrating such models into aeronautical
applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the
model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values.
Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model
performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an
example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt
component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first
describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on
that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum
safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their
targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they
meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment
process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered
valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability,
and the implications for verification.

Motivation: 确保AI的负责任发展，防止潜在负面影响，促进伦理实践。

Method: 采用多源文献综述（MLR）、问卷调查、解释性结构模型（ISM）、MICMAC分析和模糊TOPSIS方法。

Result: 识别了8类20个关键动机，其中‘人力资源’和‘协调’对其他因素影响最大。模糊TOPSIS显示团队多样性、AI治理机构等最为重要。

Conclusion: 组织应将这些动机纳入策略、治理模型和开发框架，以支持伦理AI的发展。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents transformative opportunities for
industries and society, but its responsible development is essential to prevent
unintended consequences. Ethically sound AI systems demand strategic planning,
strong governance, and an understanding of the key drivers that promote
responsible practices. This study aims to identify and prioritize the
motivators that drive the ethical development of AI systems. A Multivocal
Literature Review (MLR) and a questionnaire-based survey were conducted to
capture current practices in ethical AI. We applied Interpretive Structure
Modeling (ISM) to explore the relationships between motivator categories,
followed by MICMAC analysis to classify them by their driving and dependence
power. Fuzzy TOPSIS was used to rank these motivators by importance. Twenty key
motivators were identified and grouped into eight categories: Human Resource,
Knowledge Integration, Coordination, Project Administration, Standards,
Technology Factor, Stakeholders, and Strategy & Matrices. ISM results showed
that 'Human Resource' and 'Coordination' heavily influence other factors.
MICMAC analysis placed categories like Human Resource (CA1), Coordination
(CA3), Stakeholders (CA7), and Strategy & Matrices (CA8) in the independent
cluster, indicating high driving but low dependence power. Fuzzy TOPSIS ranked
motivators such as promoting team diversity, establishing AI governance bodies,
appointing oversight leaders, and ensuring data privacy as most critical. To
support ethical AI adoption, organizations should align their strategies with
these motivators and integrate them into their policies, governance models, and
development frameworks.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于指令调优大语言模型的多类别分类框架，用于检测GitHub上的性别歧视和厌女评论，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术社区（如GitHub）中的性别歧视和厌女行为阻碍包容性，现有工具难以有效检测细微伤害。

Method: 采用指令调优的大语言模型框架，通过20次提示优化迭代，评估了1,440条标记评论。

Result: 优化后的方法（GPT-4o与提示19）MCC为0.501，表现优于基线，但对复杂语境下的性别歧视检测仍有局限。

Conclusion: 清晰的提示设计和结构化输出显著提升了性别歧视检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Background: Sexist and misogynistic behavior significantly hinders inclusion
in technical communities like GitHub, causing developers, especially
minorities, to leave due to subtle biases and microaggressions. Current
moderation tools primarily rely on keyword filtering or binary classifiers,
limiting their ability to detect nuanced harm effectively.
  Aims: This study introduces a fine-grained, multi-class classification
framework that leverages instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to
identify twelve distinct categories of sexist and misogynistic comments on
GitHub.
  Method: We utilized an instruction-tuned LLM-based framework with systematic
prompt refinement across 20 iterations, evaluated on 1,440 labeled GitHub
comments across twelve sexism/misogyny categories. Model performances were
rigorously compared using precision, recall, F1-score, and the Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
  Results: Our optimized approach (GPT-4o with Prompt 19) achieved an MCC of
0.501, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. While this model had
low false positives, it struggled to interpret nuanced, context-dependent
sexism and misogyny reliably.
  Conclusion: Well-designed prompts with clear definitions and structured
outputs significantly improve the accuracy and interpretability of sexism
detection, enabling precise and practical moderation on developer platforms
like GitHub.

Motivation: CI配置迁移在开源开发中需求频繁，但手动迁移耗时且易错。现有规则方法（如CIMig）准确性不足，LLMs在代码生成任务中的潜力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出CIgrate框架，通过零样本/少样本提示或微调LLMs实现CI配置迁移，并与CIMig对比评估性能。

Result: 预期贡献包括首个LLM驱动的CI迁移方法、与规则方法的比较评估，以及LLMs在软件配置演化中的应用见解。

Conclusion: 研究旨在验证LLMs能否提升CI迁移的准确性和效率，为自动化配置迁移提供新方向。

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) configurations often need to be migrated between
services (e.g., Travis CI to GitHub Actions) as projects evolve, due to changes
in service capabilities, usage limits, or service deprecation. Previous studies
reported that migration across CI services is a recurring need in open-source
development. However, manual migration can be time-consuming and error-prone.
The state-of-the-art approach, CIMig, addresses this challenge by analyzing
past migration examples to create service-specific rules and produce equivalent
configurations across CI services. However, its relatively low accuracy raises
concerns about the overall feasibility of automated CI migration using
rule-based techniques alone. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and transformation tasks,
suggesting potential to improve the automation, usability, and generalizability
of CI configuration migration. This registered report presents a study in which
we aim to assess whether CI migration can be improved using LLMs. To this end,
we propose CIgrate, an LLM-based framework for automatically migrating CI
configurations. We plan to evaluate the performance of CIgrate compared to
CIMig as a baseline, in different setups (a) zero-shot/few-shot prompting of
LLMs for configuration migration and (b) fine-tuning an LLM on a dataset of
already established CI service migrations. We will also seek developer feedback
on the quality and usability of the generated configurations. We formulate
research questions focusing on the accuracy of LLM-generated migrations versus
ground truth and the output of CIMig. The expected contributions include the
first LLM-powered approach for CI service migration, a comparative evaluation
of its effectiveness compared to rule-based approaches, and insight into
leveraging LLMs to support software configuration evolution.

Conclusion: 平衡任务复杂性对维持测试人员的动力至关重要，软件测试是一个动态且智力上富有挑战性的领域。

Abstract: As software systems continue to grow in complexity, testing has become a
fundamental part of ensuring the quality and reliability of software products.
Yet, software testing is still often perceived, both in industry and academia,
as a repetitive, low-skill activity. This perception fails to recognize the
creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability required in testing work. Tasks
such as designing complex test cases, automating testing processes, and
handling shifting requirements illustrate the challenges testing professionals
regularly face. To better understand these experiences, we conducted a study
with software testing professionals to explore the nature of challenging tasks
in software testing and how they affect these professionals. Our findings show
that tasks involving creativity, ongoing learning, and time pressure are often
seen as motivating and rewarding. On the other hand, a lack of challenge or
overwhelming demands can lead to frustration and disengagement. These findings
demonstrate the importance of balancing task complexity to sustain motivation
and present software testing as a dynamic and intellectually engaging field.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code
generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear
and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit
ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we
present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art
code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We
extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing
realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing
a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We
evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their
functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories.
Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing
can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task
descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger
models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to
the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error
patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior,
and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs
that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in
natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model
training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and
ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

Abstract: Quantum computing in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era presents
significant challenges in differentiating quantum software bugs from hardware
noise. Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering
cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of
quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap,
we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to
differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our
methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's
algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing
quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and
classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.

Motivation: 现代软件供应链的复杂性需要工具如SBOM和SCA来管理依赖和漏洞，但现有工具缺乏整合，难以提供统一的依赖-漏洞视图。

Method: 提出VDGraph，将SBOM和SCA数据整合为图谱表示，并解决数据冲突问题；通过CycloneDX和OSV-Scanner实现概念验证。

Result: 在21个Java项目中应用VDGraph，发现高风险漏洞集中在深层依赖（三级及以上），直接或次级依赖更安全。

Conclusion: VDGraph通过图谱理论方法提升了漏洞传播的可视化，为实际项目提供了可扩展的自动化分析基础。

Abstract: The high complexity of modern software supply chains necessitates tools such
as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to manage component dependencies, and
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerabilities. While
there exists limited integration between SBOMs and SCA tools, a unified view of
complex dependency-vulnerability relationships remains elusive. In this paper,
we introduce VDGraph, a novel knowledge graph-based methodology for integrating
vulnerability and dependency data into a holistic view. VDGraph consolidates
SBOM and SCA outputs into a graph representation of software projects'
dependencies and vulnerabilities. We provide a formal description and analysis
of the theoretical properties of VDGraph and present solutions to manage
possible conflicts between the SBOM and SCA data. We further introduce and
evaluate a practical, proof-of-concept implementation of VDGraph using two
popular SBOM and SCA tools, namely CycloneDX Maven plugin and Google's
OSV-Scanner. We apply VDGraph on 21 popular Java projects. Through the
formulation of appropriate queries on the graphs, we uncover the existence of
concentrated risk points (i.e., vulnerable components of high severity
reachable through numerous dependency paths). We further show that
vulnerabilities predominantly emerge at a depth of three dependency levels or
higher, indicating that direct or secondary dependencies exhibit lower
vulnerability density and tend to be more secure. Thus, VDGraph contributes a
graph-theoretic methodology that improves visibility into how vulnerabilities
propagate through complex, transitive dependencies. Moreover, our
implementation, which combines open SBOM and SCA standards with Neo4j, lays a
foundation for scalable and automated analysis across real-world projects.

TL;DR: GeoJSEval是一个多模态、函数级的自动评估框架，用于评估大型语言模型在JavaScript地理空间代码生成中的表现，包括准确性、稳定性和效率等多维指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在地理空间代码生成中的广泛应用，需要系统化的评估方法来衡量其能力，尤其是在JavaScript环境中对地理空间计算和可视化的支持。

Method: 提出了GeoJSEval框架，包含标准化测试套件、代码提交引擎和评估模块，覆盖432个函数级任务和2071个测试用例，涉及5个JavaScript地理空间库和25种数据类型。

Result: 对18个先进大型语言模型进行了全面评估，揭示了它们在空间语义理解、代码可靠性和函数调用准确性方面的显著性能差异和瓶颈。

Conclusion: GeoJSEval为地理空间代码生成模型的标准化评估和优化提供了方法论、资源和工具，具有强扩展性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in code
generation tasks, geospatial code generation has emerged as a critical frontier
in the integration of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. This
trend underscores the urgent need for systematic evaluation methodologies to
assess LLMs generation capabilities in geospatial contexts. In particular,
geospatial computation and visualization tasks in JavaScript environments rely
heavily on orchestrating diverse frontend libraries and ecosystems, placing
elevated demands on a model's semantic understanding and code synthesis
abilities. To address this challenge, we propose GeoJSEval--the first
multimodal, function-level automatic evaluation framework for LLMs in
JavaScript-based geospatial code generation. GeoJSEval comprises three core
components: a standardized test suite (GeoJSEval-Bench), a code submission
engine, and an evaluation module. It includes 432 function-level tasks and
2,071 structured test cases spanning five widely used JavaScript geospatial
libraries and 25 mainstream geospatial data types. GeoJSEval enables
multidimensional quantitative evaluation across metrics such as accuracy,
output stability, execution efficiency, resource consumption, and error type
distribution, and integrates boundary testing mechanisms to enhance robustness
and coverage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs
using GeoJSEval, revealing significant performance disparities and bottlenecks
in spatial semantic understanding, code reliability, and function invocation
accuracy. GeoJSEval provides a foundational methodology, evaluation resource,
and practical toolkit for the standardized assessment and optimization of
geospatial code generation models, with strong extensibility and applicability
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: IntentionTest 是一种生成项目特定测试的方法，通过结构化描述验证意图，显著提升测试的语义正确性和通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试生成技术多基于代码覆盖率，但实际项目中测试需体现开发者的验证意图和项目特定知识，否则难以通过代码审查。

Method: IntentionTest 利用验证意图描述和项目中的可重用测试代码，将测试生成问题转化为基于意图的代码编辑问题。

Result: 在 4,146 个测试案例中，IntentionTest 比 ChatTester 生成更多语义正确的测试，提升突变分数 39.03%，覆盖率重叠 40.14%，通过率提高 21.30%。

Conclusion: IntentionTest 通过结合验证意图和项目知识，显著提升测试生成的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Test cases are valuable assets for maintaining software quality. While
numerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either
by maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),
practical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each
test reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and
embodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what
assertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly
pass code review and be integrated into the software product.
  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific
tests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is
motivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared
to coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to
test; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that
domain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code
and a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal
comment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the
project to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test
generation problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the
validation intention. It generates a test including both test prefix and
oracle, which aims to be executable and semantically correct.
  We evaluate IntentionTest against state-of-the-art baselines on 4,146 test
cases from 13 open-source projects. Specifically, compared to ChatTester,
IntentionTest can (1) generate significantly more semantically correct tests,
improving common mutation scores by 39.03% and coverage overlap with
ground-truth tests by 40.14%; (2) generate 21.30% more successful passing
tests.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法Gilesi，通过记录客户端测试中的API交互快照来检测第三方库的行为破坏性变更（BBCs），解决了传统回归测试难以发现BBCs的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发依赖第三方库，但库的更新可能引入行为破坏性变更（BBCs），传统回归测试难以检测这些变更。

Method: 利用客户端测试记录API交互快照（协议、输入输出值、异常等），并在库更新时比较新旧快照以识别BBCs。

Result: 原型工具Gilesi在实验中可靠地检测到了客户端测试套件遗漏的BBCs。

Conclusion: Gilesi方法有效解决了BBCs检测问题，为客户端与库的兼容性测试提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern software development heavily relies on third-party libraries to speed
up development and enhance quality. As libraries evolve, they may break the
tacit contract established with their clients by introducing behavioral
breaking changes (BBCs) that alter run-time behavior and silently break client
applications without being detected at compile time. Traditional regression
tests on the client side often fail to detect such BBCs, either due to limited
library coverage or weak assertions that do not sufficiently exercise the
library's expected behavior. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach
to client--library compatibility testing that leverages existing client tests
in a novel way. Instead of relying on developer-written assertions, we propose
recording the actual interactions at the API boundary during the execution of
client tests (protocol, input and output values, exceptions, etc.). These
sequences of API interactions are stored as snapshots which capture the exact
contract expected by a client at a specific point in time. As the library
evolves, we compare the original and new snapshots to identify perturbations in
the contract, flag potential BBCs, and notify clients. We implement this
technique in our prototype tool Gilesi, a Java framework that automatically
instruments library APIs, records snapshots, and compares them. Through a
preliminary case study on several client--library pairs with artificially
seeded BBCs, we show that Gilesi reliably detects BBCs missed by client test
suites.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效利用未显式导入的内部API信息，影响了代码补全的准确性。

Method: 扩展API表示，构建使用示例和语义描述，形成知识库供LLM生成补全。

Result: 在ProjBench和CrossCodeEval上，代码精确匹配提升22.72%，标识符匹配提升18.31%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有方法，并能与现有基线结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动漏洞修复（AVR）中的表现，假设其成功可能源于训练数据泄漏或完美故障定位等隐藏因素。通过控制实验验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在AVR中的表现是否依赖于隐藏因素（如数据泄漏或完美故障定位），而非其真正的修复能力。

Method: 通过故意偏移漏洞位置生成提示，使用LLM生成补丁并由另一LLM审核，结合回归测试和手动审核验证结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs的表现可能确实依赖于隐藏因素，而非其修复能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在AVR中的成功可能部分源于数据泄漏或完美定位，而非其真正的修复能力。

Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of
program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)
outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code
generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands"
such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM
reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by
deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the
prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large
localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because
any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans
benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.
A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the
result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually
audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the
Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges of optimal online policy learning
under missing data. State-of-the-art algorithms implicitly assume that rewards
are always observable. I show that when rewards are missing at random, the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm maintains optimal regret bounds;
however, it selects suboptimal policies with high probability as soon as this
assumption is relaxed. To overcome this limitation, I introduce a fully
nonparametric algorithm-Doubly-Robust Upper Confidence Bound (DR-UCB)-which
explicitly models the form of missingness through observable covariates and
achieves a nearly-optimal worst-case regret rate of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.
To prove this result, I derive high-probability bounds for a class of
doubly-robust estimators that hold under broad dependence structures.
Simulation results closely match the theoretical predictions, validating the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 解决边界参数下似然比统计量分布不连续导致的尺寸失真问题。

Method: 利用极限分布单调性和矩形置信集构造临界值，计算简单且高效。

Result: 新方法在模拟中表现出良好的尺寸和功效特性。

Conclusion: 提出的临界值构造方法在多种场景下有效，适用于线性回归和ARCH模型。

Abstract: Limit distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are well-known to be
discontinuous in the presence of nuisance parameters at the boundary of the
parameter space, which lead to size distortions when standard critical values
are used for testing. In this paper, we propose a new and simple way of
constructing critical values that yields uniformly correct asymptotic size,
regardless of whether nuisance parameters are at, near or far from the boundary
of the parameter space. Importantly, the proposed critical values are trivial
to compute and at the same time provide powerful tests in most settings. In
comparison to existing size-correction methods, the new approach exploits the
monotonicity of the two components of the limiting distribution of the
likelihood ratio statistic, in conjunction with rectangular confidence sets for
the nuisance parameters, to gain computational tractability. Uniform validity
is established for likelihood ratio tests based on the new critical values, and
we provide illustrations of their construction in two key examples: (i) testing
a coefficient of interest in the classical linear regression model with
non-negativity constraints on control coefficients, and, (ii) testing for the
presence of exogenous variables in autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic
models (ARCH) with exogenous regressors. Simulations confirm that the tests
have desirable size and power properties. A brief empirical illustration
demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed test in relation to testing for
spill-overs and ARCH effects.

Motivation: 社会科学和医学研究中多重假设检验增加了假阳性的风险，传统方法（如Bonferroni校正）过于保守且忽略假设间的层次关系。

Method: 回顾并比较了固定序列、回退和门控等层次化多重检验方法。

Result: 层次化方法在保持错误控制的同时提高了统计功效，适用于假设间存在逻辑或因果关系的场景。

Conclusion: 层次化多重检验方法为实证研究提供了更强大且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Empirical research in the social and medical sciences frequently involves
testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, increasing the risk of false
positives due to chance. Classical multiple testing procedures, such as the
Bonferroni correction, control the family-wise error rate (FWER) but tend to be
overly conservative, reducing statistical power. Stepwise alternatives like the
Holm and Hochberg procedures offer improved power while maintaining error
control under certain dependence structures. However, these standard approaches
typically ignore hierarchical relationships among hypotheses -- structures that
are common in settings such as clinical trials and program evaluations, where
outcomes are often logically or causally linked. Hierarchical multiple testing
procedures -- including fixed sequence, fallback, and gatekeeping methods --
explicitly incorporate these relationships, providing more powerful and
interpretable frameworks for inference. This paper reviews key hierarchical
methods, compares their statistical properties and practical trade-offs, and
discusses implications for applied empirical research.

Conclusion: 该方法在蒙特卡洛模拟和实证应用中表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient method for binary
classification using Manski's (1975,1985) maximum score model when covariates
are discretely distributed and parameters are partially but not point
identified. We establish conditions under which it is minimax optimal to allow
for either non-classification or random classification and derive finite-sample
and asymptotic lower bounds on the probability of correct classification. We
also describe an extension of our method to continuous covariates. Our approach
avoids the computational difficulty of maximum score estimation by
reformulating the problem as two linear programs. Compared to parametric and
nonparametric methods, our method balances extrapolation ability with minimal
distributional assumptions. Monte Carlo simulations and empirical applications
demonstrate its effectiveness and practical relevance.

Method: 在单代理模型中，利用同质性、单调性、凹性等非参数假设；在动态博弈模型中，利用无关性、可交换性等假设。

Result: 非参数假设能显著增强动态结构模型中的识别能力，具体表现为多项式等式和不等式。

Conclusion: 经济分析中广泛使用的非参数假设在动态结构模型中具有重要的识别作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates how the discount factor and payoff functions can be
identified in stationary infinite-horizon dynamic discrete choice models. In
single-agent models, we show that common nonparametric assumptions on
per-period payoffs -- such as homogeneity of degree one, monotonicity,
concavity, zero cross-differences, and complementarity -- provide identifying
restrictions on the discount factor. These restrictions take the form of
polynomial equalities and inequalities with degrees bounded by the cardinality
of the state space. These restrictions also identify payoff functions under
standard normalization at one action. In dynamic game models, we show that
firm-specific discount factors can be identified using assumptions such as
irrelevance of other firms' lagged actions, exchangeability, and the
independence of adjustment costs from other firms' actions. Our results
demonstrate that widely used nonparametric assumptions in economic analysis can
provide substantial identifying power in dynamic structural models.

Abstract: This paper examines the identification and estimation of treatment effects in
staggered adoption designs -- a common extension of the canonical
Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model to multiple groups and time-periods -- in
the presence of (time varying) misclassification of the treatment status as
well as of anticipation. We demonstrate that standard estimators are biased
with respect to commonly used causal parameters of interest under such forms of
misspecification. To address this issue, we provide modified estimators that
recover the Average Treatment Effect of observed and true switching units,
respectively. Additionally, we suggest a testing procedure aimed at detecting
the timing and extent of misclassification and anticipation effects. We
illustrate the proposed methods with an application to the effects of an
anti-cheating policy on school mean test scores in high stakes national exams
in Indonesia.

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗性混杂场景下提供鲁棒保证，适用于实际政策评估。

Abstract: This paper develops a robust and efficient method for policy learning from
observational data in the presence of unobserved confounding, complementing
existing instrumental variable (IV) based approaches. We employ the marginal
sensitivity model (MSM) to relax the commonly used yet restrictive
unconfoundedness assumption by introducing a sensitivity parameter that
captures the extent of selection bias induced by unobserved confounders.
Building on this framework, we consider two distributionally robust welfare
criteria, defined as the worst-case welfare and policy improvement functions,
evaluated over an uncertainty set of counterfactual distributions characterized
by the MSM. Closed-form expressions for both welfare criteria are derived.
Leveraging these identification results, we construct doubly robust scores and
estimate the robust policies by maximizing the proposed criteria. Our approach
accommodates flexible machine learning methods for estimating nuisance
components, even when these converge at moderately slow rate. We establish
asymptotic regret bounds for the resulting policies, providing a robust
guarantee against the most adversarial confounding scenario. The proposed
method is evaluated through extensive simulation studies and empirical
applications to the JTPA study and Head Start program.

Abstract: This study explores the structural and performance impacts of artificial

examines firm size, revenue productivity, valuation efficiency, and capital
utilization across pre AI and AI era cohorts. Findings reveal larger structures
and lower efficiency in AI era firms, supported by a dataset of 914 cleaned
firms. The study offers insights into AIs transformative role, suggesting that
while AI era firms attract higher funding and achieve higher absolute
valuations, their per employee productivity and efficiency ratios are lower,
potentially indicating earlystage investments in technology that have yet to

Abstract: This paper develops the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical
framework for analyzing AI-driven spatial distribution dynamics in metropolitan
areas undergoing demographic transition. We extend New Economic Geography by
formalizing five novel AI-specific mechanisms: algorithmic learning spillovers,
digital infrastructure returns, virtual agglomeration effects, AI-human
complementarity, and network externalities. Using Tokyo as our empirical
laboratory, we implement rigorous causal identification through five
complementary econometric strategies and develop machine learning predictions
across 27 future scenarios spanning 2024-2050. Our theoretical framework
generates six testable hypotheses, all receiving strong empirical support. The
causal analysis reveals that AI implementation increases agglomeration
concentration by 4.2-5.2 percentage points, with heterogeneous effects across
industries: high AI-readiness sectors experience 8.4 percentage point
increases, while low AI-readiness sectors show 1.2 percentage point gains.
Machine learning predictions demonstrate that aggressive AI adoption can offset
60-80\% of aging-related productivity declines. We provide a strategic
three-phase policy framework for managing AI-driven spatial transformation
while promoting inclusive development. The integrated approach establishes a
new paradigm for analyzing technology-driven spatial change with global

Abstract: It is estimated that over one-fourth of US households experienced a power
outage in 2023, costing on average US $\$150$ Bn annually, with $87\%$ of
outages caused by natural hazards. Indeed, numerous studies have examined the
macroeconomic impact of power network interruptions, employing a wide variety
of modeling methods and data parameterization techniques, which warrants
further investigation. In this paper, we quantify the macroeconomic effects of
three significant natural hazard-induced US power outages: Hurricane Ian
(2022), the 2021 Texas Blackouts, and Tropical Storm Isaias (2020). Our
analysis evaluates the sensitivity of three commonly used data parameterization
techniques (household interruptions, kWh lost, and satellite luminosity), along
with three static models (Leontief and Ghosh, critical input, and inoperability
Input-Output). We find the mean domestic loss estimates to be US $\$3.13$ Bn,
US $\$4.18$ Bn, and US $\$2.93$ Bn, respectively. Additionally, data
parameterization techniques can alter estimated losses by up to $23.1\%$ and
$50.5\%$. Consistent with the wide range of outputs, we find that the GDP
losses are highly sensitive to model architecture, data parameterization, and
analyst assumptions. Results sensitivity is not uniform across models and
arises from important a priori analyst decisions, demonstrated by data
parameterization techniques yielding $11\%$ and $45\%$ differences within a
model. We find that the numerical value output is more sensitive than
intersectoral linkages and other macroeconomic insights. To our knowledge, we
contribute to literature the first systematic comparison of multiple IO models
and parameterizations across several natural hazard-induced long-duration power
outages, providing guidance and insights for analysts.

### [382] [Measuring the Macroeconomic and Financial Stability of Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20340)
*Faruque Ahamed,Md Ataur Rahman Chowdhury*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究为孟加拉国构建了一个综合金融稳定指数（AFSI），评估2016至2024年间该国金融系统的整体健康状况和韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过量化金融稳定性，为政策制定者提供早期预警工具，并填补新兴经济体金融稳定性测量的研究空白。

Method: 采用19个宏观金融指标，涵盖四大关键领域（实际部门、金融与货币部门、财政部门和外部部门），通过标准化评分和等权重方案构建综合指数。

Result: 结果显示，尽管实际和财政部门在2024财年有所改善，但整体金融稳定性下降，主要由于金融与货币部门表现不佳及外部部门持续疲软。

Conclusion: 研究强调了宏观金融领域的相互关联性，呼吁结构性改革、加强监管和宏观审慎政策协调，AFSI框架为政策制定提供了实用工具。

Abstract: This study constructs an Aggregate Financial Stability Index (AFSI) for
Bangladesh to evaluate the systemic health and resilience of the countrys
financial system during the period from 2016 to 2024. The index incorporates 19
macrofinancial indicators across four key sectors Real Sector, Financial and
Monetary Sector, Fiscal Sector and External Sector. Using a normalized scoring
approach and equal weighting scheme, sub-indices were aggregated to form a
comprehensive measure of financial stability. The findings indicate that while
the Real and Fiscal sectors demonstrated modest improvements in FY2024, overall
financial stability deteriorated, largely due to poor performance in the
Financial and Monetary Sector and continued weakness in the External Sector.
Key stress indicators include rising non-performing loans, declining capital
adequacy ratios, weak capital market performance, growing external debt, and
shrinking foreign exchange reserves. The study highlights the
interconnectedness of macro-financial sectors and the urgent need for
structural reforms, stronger regulatory oversight, and enhanced macroprudential
policy coordination. The AFSI framework developed in this paper offers an early
warning tool for policymakers and contributes to the literature on financial
stability measurement in emerging economies.

### [383] [Beyond pay: AI skills reward more job benefits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20410)
*Fabian Stephany,Alejandra Mira,Matthew Bone*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究发现，AI相关职位在美国劳动力市场中不仅提供高薪，还显著增加非货币性福利，如带薪休假、远程工作等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI技能在劳动力市场中是否带来非货币性奖励，填补现有研究对高薪之外福利的空白。

Method: 分析2018至2024年间约1000万份在线职位空缺数据，识别AI相关职位并比较其非货币性福利。

Result: AI职位更可能提供非货币性福利，如带薪休假和远程工作，且高薪职位往往同时提供更多福利。

Conclusion: 雇主通过货币和非货币性奖励竞争稀缺AI人才，挑战技术替代劳动力的叙事。

Abstract: This study investigates the non-monetary rewards associated with artificial
intelligence (AI) skills in the U.S. labour market. Using a dataset of
approximately ten million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2024, we identify
AI roles-positions requiring at least one AI-related skill-and examine the
extent to which these roles offer non-monetary benefits such as tuition
assistance, paid leave, health and well-being perks, parental leave, workplace
culture enhancements, and remote work options. While previous research has
documented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand
and limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates
into enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are
significantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for
education requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely
for an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to
provide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to
bundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases
coincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave
or health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than
AI roles without this benefit. This pattern is particularly pronounced in years
and occupations experiencing the highest AI-related demand, pointing to a
demand-driven dynamic. Our findings underscore the strong pull of AI talent in
the labor market and challenge narratives of technological displacement,
highlighting instead how employers compete for scarce talent through both
financial and non-financial incentives.

### [384] [Aligning Large Language Model Agents with Rational and Moral Preferences: A Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20796)
*Wei Lu,Daniel L. Chen,Christian B. Hansen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在战略互动中的行为，发现其与人类行为存在显著差异，并提出了一种基于经济推理的监督微调方法，以调整LLM的经济偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地自主参与经济和道德决策，理解其在战略互动中的行为至关重要。

Method: 使用经典经济游戏评估LLM偏好，提出基于合成数据集的监督微调方法，调整LLM的经济偏好。

Result: 微调后，LLM行为更接近目标经济代理（如homo economicus或homo moralis），并在道德困境和市场竞争中表现出不同行为。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种可复制、经济高效的方法，基于道德经济原则调整AI偏好。

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic
interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate
autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate
LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations
from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited
incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more
consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised
fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic
reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two
stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on
individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of
Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).
We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior
toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned
agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous
vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples
illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from
structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This
work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded
pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

### [385] [A Simulation-Based Conceptual Model for Tokenized Recycling: Integrating Blockchain, Market Dynamics, and Behavioral Economics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19901)
*Atta Ul Mustafa*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于区块链的激励回收系统概念模型，结合市场定价、行为经济学和碳信用机制，旨在解决传统回收系统的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回收系统依赖静态政府补贴，难以持续激发公众参与。

Method: 通过动态代币价值和非货币行为驱动（如社会规范、声誉激励），构建双激励结构，并使用蒙特卡洛模拟评估不同情景下的效果。

Result: 模型为政策制定者、城市规划者和技术开发者提供了去中心化和市场响应的可持续废物管理解决方案的见解。

Conclusion: 该模型为未来政策实验和试点项目提供了原型框架，需通过实地试验或行为实验进一步验证。

Abstract: This study develops a conceptual simulation model for a tokenized recycling
incentive system that integrates blockchain infrastructure, market-driven
pricing, behavioral economics, and carbon credit mechanisms. The model aims to
address the limitations of traditional recycling systems, which often rely on
static government subsidies and fail to generate sustained public
participation. By introducing dynamic token values linked to real-world supply
and demand conditions, as well as incorporating non-monetary behavioral drivers
(e.g., social norms, reputational incentives), the framework creates a
dual-incentive structure that can adapt over time. The model uses Monte Carlo
simulations to estimate outcomes under a range of scenarios involving
operational costs, carbon pricing, token volatility, and behavioral adoption
rates. Due to the absence of real-world implementations of such integrated
blockchain-based recycling systems, the paper remains theoretical and
simulation-based. It is intended as a prototype framework for future policy
experimentation and pilot projects. The model provides insights for
policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers aiming to explore
decentralized and market-responsive solutions to sustainable waste management.
Future work should focus on validating the model through field trials or
behavioral experiments.

### [386] [A General Framework for Estimating Preferences Using Response Time Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20403)
*Federico Echenique,Alireza Fallah,Michael I. Jordan*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从选择数据和反应时间中恢复偏好参数的通用方法，适用于多种决策模型，并在实验中验证了其预测准确性和经济参数估计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用反应时间数据更准确地估计偏好参数，特别是在决策模型中。

Method: 开发了一种通用方法，适用于流行的漂移扩散模型（DDM）及其扩展模型，以及其他利用反应时间的决策模型。

Result: 方法在DDM中具有快速收敛速度（1/n），并在跨期选择实验中验证了其预测准确性和经济参数估计的改进。

Conclusion: 反应时间数据的利用对提高预测准确性和经济参数估计具有重要意义。

Abstract: We propose a general methodology for recovering preference parameters from
data on choices and response times. Our methods yield estimates with fast
($1/n$ for $n$ data points) convergence rates when specialized to the popular
Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), but are broadly applicable to generalizations of
the DDM as well as to alternative models of decision making that make use of
response time data. The paper develops an empirical application to an
experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times
delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically
relevant parameters.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无限效用流上的偏好关系，满足无时期歧视、帕累托准则，且几乎所有效用流对都是严格可比较的，反驳了Zame的论点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳Zame关于代际公平操作化的论点，证明存在满足特定条件的偏好关系。

Method: 构建一种无限效用流上的偏好关系，确保无时期歧视、满足帕累托准则，并实现严格可比较性。

Result: 成功构造出满足条件的偏好关系，证明Zame的论点不成立。

Conclusion: 该偏好关系为代际公平操作化提供了新的可能性，并纠正了Zame的结论。

Abstract: There exists a preference relation on infinite utility streams that does not
discriminate between different periods, satisfies the Pareto criterion, and so
that almost all pairs of utility streams are strictly comparable. Such a
preference relation provides a counterexample to a claim in [Zame, William R.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多级注意力堆叠集成深度学习模型的二元肺结节分类方法，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CT图像中肺结节（良性vs恶性）分类的挑战，提高诊断准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用三种预训练模型（EfficientNet V2 S、MobileViT XXS、DenseNet201）结合自定义分类头，采用两阶段注意力机制和元学习器优化预测，动态焦点损失和MixUp增强解决类别不平衡。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上表现优异，准确率98.09%，AUC 0.9961，错误率降低35%，敏感性和特异性均超过98%。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为肺癌筛查的自动化辅助工具，显著提升诊断效果。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

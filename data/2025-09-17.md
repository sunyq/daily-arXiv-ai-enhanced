<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助越南高中生更好地准备国家高中数学毕业考试，同时减轻教师手动出题的工作负担，提供高质量的教学资源。

Method: 集成三个专门AI代理：基于规范矩阵的题目生成器、提供详细步骤推理的解题器/解释器、以及根据学生表现自适应的个性化导师。

Result: 初步评估显示V-Math能生成符合矩阵要求的考试题目，具有高解题准确率，提供连贯的解释，并丰富练习题多样性。

Abstract: This paper develops an autonomous agentic framework called V-Math that aims
to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High
School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates
three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question
generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a
personalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Beyond enabling
self-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative,
compliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks.
This reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources. We describe
the system architecture, focusing on practice modes for learners and
teacher-oriented features for question generation. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate that V-Math produces matrix-aligned exams with high solution
accuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice
materials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable
mathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering
teachers through AI-assisted exam creation.

*Oddvar Kloster,Bjørnar Luteberget,Carlo Mannino,Giorgio Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DISPLIB标准格式和基准数据集，用于火车调度问题的算法性能比较和可重复性研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有火车调度优化研究缺乏统一标准，代码和数据很少公开，导致算法性能难以比较和复现

Method: 定义统一的火车重路由和重调度问题格式DISPLIB，收集多个真实工业案例数据，提供参考求解器实现

Result: 建立了公开可用的基准数据集和问题定义标准，使研究者无需工业合作即可开展火车调度算法研究

Conclusion: DISPLIB为火车调度问题研究提供了标准化平台，促进了算法性能的实证比较和研究的可重复性

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

### [3] [InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263)
*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个评估大语言模型归纳物理推理能力的视觉问答基准InPhyRe，发现现有模型在违反物理规律的场景中推理能力薄弱，存在语言偏见且忽视视觉输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型仅编码训练时见过的物理规律作为参数知识，无法处理违反这些规律的推理场景，而人类具备从少量视觉示例中适应新物理环境的归纳推理能力，这对安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 创建InPhyRe基准，使用算法生成的合成碰撞视频评估模型预测碰撞结果的能力，测试了13个大语言模型。

Result: 发现模型难以将有限的参数知识应用于推理；在违反物理规律的演示样本中归纳推理能力弱；存在语言偏见且忽视视觉输入，质疑模型对视觉输入的可信度。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在归纳物理推理方面存在显著缺陷，需要改进以提升在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

### [4] [LLMAP: LLM-Assisted Multi-Objective Route Planning with User Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12273)
*Liangqi Yuan,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton,Sabine Brunswicker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLMAP系统，结合LLM解析自然语言偏好和多步图搜索算法，实现多约束条件下的最优路径规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路径规划方法存在两大问题：直接使用LLM处理大规模地图数据困难，图搜索方法理解自然语言偏好能力有限，且全球用户时空分布高度异构不可预测

Method: 使用LLM-as-Parser解析自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建迭代搜索算法(MSGS)进行最优路径求解，采用多目标优化自适应调整权重

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个不同复杂度路由提示上进行实验，结果显示该方法在多重约束下实现了优越性能

Conclusion: LLMAP系统成功解决了自然语言驱动路径规划中的关键挑战，在保证多重约束条件下实现了高性能的路线规划

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

### [5] [Developing an aeroponic smart experimental greenhouse for controlling irrigation and plant disease detection using deep learning and IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12274)
*Mohammadreza Narimani,Ali Hajiahmad,Ali Moghimi,Reza Alimardani,Shahin Rafiee,Amir Hossein Mirzabe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发并测试了一个智能气雾栽培温室系统，结合物联网和人工智能技术来监测天竺葵植物状态和环境条件，实现精准控制和病害检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温室环境控制和植物状态监测对于及时做出管理决策、促进作物生产至关重要，需要开发更高效的智能监控系统

Method: 开发了基于物联网的平台来控制系统环境，并使用VGG-19、InceptionResNetV2和InceptionV3算法构建AI病害检测框架，通过定期图像采集进行分析

Result: 物联网系统能持续在线发布温度、湿度、水流量等数据并调整控制参数；VGG-19算法在病害检测中表现最佳，准确率达到92%

Conclusion: 该智能温室系统成功实现了环境参数的精确监控和植物病害的自动检测，为精准农业管理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

### [6] [AIssistant: An Agentic Approach for Human--AI Collaborative Scientific Work on Reviews and Perspectives in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12282)
*Sasi Kiran Gaddipati,Farhana Keya,Gollam Rabby,Sören Auer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIssistant是一个开源的人类-AI协作框架，通过模块化工具和代理简化科学工作流的端到端创建，提高起草效率和主题一致性，但仍需人类监督确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助研究工具碎片化且缺乏以人为中心的工作流程，需要整合文献检索、假设生成、实验和论文准备等环节。

Method: 开发AIssistant框架，集成文献合成、分段实验、引用管理和自动LaTeX文本生成等模块化工具，在机器学习领域的视角和综述论文中进行初步实验。

Result: 通过三层评估（独立人类评审、自动化LLM评审、程序主席监督）显示，系统提高了起草效率和主题一致性，但存在引用幻觉、动态结构适应困难等限制。

Conclusion: 人类-AI协作对于保持事实正确性、方法合理性和伦理合规性至关重要，系统虽有效但仍需进一步改进多模态内容整合等问题。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

### [7] [Small Models, Big Results: Achieving Superior Intent Extraction through Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12423)
*Danielle Cohen,Yoni Halpern,Noam Kahlon,Joel Oren,Omri Berkovitch,Sapir Caduri,Ido Dagan,Anatoly Efros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解式方法，通过结构化交互摘要和意图提取，提升资源受限模型在UI交互轨迹中的意图理解能力，甚至超越大型多模态语言模型的基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在设备端运行的小型模型难以准确推断用户意图的问题，这些模型虽然能提供隐私保护、低成本和低延迟的用户体验，但在处理复杂的UI交互序列时表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段分解方法：首先进行结构化交互摘要，捕获每个用户操作的关键信息；然后使用微调模型在聚合摘要上进行意图提取。

Result: 该方法显著改善了资源受限模型的意图理解能力，甚至超过了大型多模态语言模型的基准性能。

Conclusion: 分解式方法为设备端智能代理提供了一种有效的意图理解解决方案，在保持隐私和效率的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

### [8] [Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434)
*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\sys的熵增强框架，用于在多轮工具辅助的代码生成任务中增强偏好优化算法，通过保持策略熵和多轮交互优化来提升测试时扩展的效果，在SWE-bench基准测试中取得了开源模型的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在软件工程复杂任务中表现仍不理想，标准对齐方法（如DPO、KTO）虽然能对齐人类偏好，但会降低输出多样性，限制测试时扩展的效果，且现有方法主要针对单轮任务，无法处理多轮推理和工具集成需求。

Method: 开发了\sys框架，通过增强偏好目标函数来显式保持策略熵，并将学习推广到多轮交互优化而非单轮响应。还提出了混合最佳轨迹选择方案，结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法。

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，使用\sys训练的30B参数模型在开源权重模型中排名第一（在\lite上）和第四（在\verified上），仅被参数量超过10倍（>350B）的模型超越。

Conclusion: \sys框架成功地将偏好优化算法适配到多轮工具辅助设置中，通过保持输出多样性和多轮优化，显著提升了LLM在复杂软件工程任务中的性能，为交互式编码代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

TL;DR: PIWM是一个紧凑的鸟瞰图世界模型，通过Soft Mask训练和Warm Start推理技术，在保持小参数量的同时显著提升物理动态建模和预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型部署中大小与性能的权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高难以在边缘设备部署，小模型物理学习能力不足导致预测效果差

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)：1) 使用Soft Mask训练改进动态物体建模和未来预测 2) 引入Warm Start推理技术零样本提升预测质量

Result: 在相同参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型提升60.6%的加权总分；最小PIWM模型(130M)相比最大基线模型(400M)获得7.4%更高的加权总分和28%更快的推理速度

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，成功实现了小参数模型的高性能物理建模，为边缘设备部署高效世界模型提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

*Ryan Lucas,Kayhan Behdin,Zhipeng Wang,Qingquan Song,Shao Tang,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过聚合输入重构和链式思绩追踪的活性重构，RAC方法在保持模型理性能的同时提高了压缩效果，解决了传统剪枝方法在理性模型上的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理性语言模型在推理时产生长链式思绩追踪，部署成本高。传统的神经网络剪枝技术在理性任务上导致更大的性能损失，甚至可能使模型更慢。这是因为标准剪枝方法主要关注输入重构，而理性是一个以解码为主的任务。

Method: 提出了"理性意识压缩"(RAC)方法：在剪枝过程中同时重构输入活性和模型的策略性链式思绩追踪活性。这种方法可以无缝集成到现有的剪枝工作流中，如SparseGPT。

Result: RAC方法显著提升了现有剪枝方法的性能，在保持模型理性能力的同时提高了压缩效果。

Conclusion: 通过聚合输入重构和链式思绩追踪的活性重构，RAC方法有效解决了传统剪枝方法在理性模型上的性能下降问题，为理性语言模型的高效部署提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

TL;DR: PowerGPT是一个AI驱动的系统，通过整合大语言模型和统计引擎，自动化临床试验设计中的检验选择和样本量计算，显著提高了任务完成率、准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 样本量计算对于临床研究至关重要，但其复杂性和对统计专业知识的依赖给许多研究者造成了障碍，需要开发更易用的工具来提高可及性。

Method: 开发PowerGPT系统，将大语言模型与统计引擎集成，自动化检验选择和样本量估计过程。通过随机试验评估其有效性。

Result: PowerGPT显著提高了任务完成率（检验选择99.3% vs 88.9%，样本量计算99.3% vs 77.8%）和准确性（样本量估计94.1% vs 55.4%），同时减少了平均完成时间（4.0 vs 9.3分钟）。这些改进在各种统计检验中保持一致，惠及统计学家和非统计学家。

Conclusion: PowerGPT代表了一种可扩展的AI驱动方法，能够提高临床研究中统计功效分析的可及性、效率和准确性，目前已在多个机构部署使用。

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学和理论计算机科学都致力于分类和解释任务难度，需要研究智能机制如何通过物理约束和认知策略来降低任务复杂度

Method: 通过分析Soma Cube拼图的分支因子（搜索树出度），定量评估任务难度，并系统研究预处理（认知组块）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知支架）和剪枝（认知推理）等策略如何修改复杂度

Result: 研究发现通过分层认知策略可以逐步改进试错搜索，有能力的工具使用通过利用物理约束来降低有效时间复杂度

Conclusion: 提出智力模型作为算法库，能够同时调用心智和物质的能力，通过"物质性原则"将计算复杂度概念映射到认知问题解决策略

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

TL;DR: 本研究通过可解释的两步工作流分析俄亥俄州环岛事故，识别出四种事故模式，并量化了不同条件下伤害严重性的驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环岛虽然减少了严重事故，但风险模式因条件而异，需要深入分析不同条件下的风险机制以支持安全改进。

Method: 采用聚类对应分析(CCA)识别共现因素和四种事故模式，然后使用基于树的严重性模型结合SHAP解释来量化伤害驱动因素。

Result: 结果显示在黑暗、湿滑路面和较高限速条件下，与固定物体或角度事件同时发生时严重性更高；在晴朗、低速环境下严重性较低。特定模式解释揭示了入口处、多车道循环和减速时的不同机制。

Conclusion: 该工作流将模式发现与案例级解释相结合，支持现场筛查、对策选择和审计就绪报告，为公共安全分析提供了实用的可解释AI模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Abstract: We introduce a novel training methodology named zELO, which optimizes
retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically
equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised
data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models:
zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores
in multiple domains, including finance, legal, code, and STEM, outperforming
closed-source proprietary rerankers on both NDCG@10 and Recall. These models
also demonstrate great versatility, maintaining their 0-shot performance on
out-of-domain and private customer datasets. The training data included 112,000
queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from
unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

TL;DR: 基于Agentic AI的Minerva CQ系统，通过实时代理协作提升联系中心效率和客户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI协助工具多为被动响应，缺乏深层上下文理解，导致处理时间长、一次解决率低和客户满意度不佳

Method: 提出Agentic AI概念，开发Minerva CQ系统，整合实时转写、意图情感检测、实体识别、上下文检索、动态客户画像和对话摘要等功能

Result: 在生产环境部署后，Minerva CQ作为AI副驾执行，在多个部署中实现了代理效率和客户体验的可测改善

Conclusion: Agentic AI通过主动式、自主性的工具使用系统，能够有效降低代理计算负荷，提升联系中心整体性能

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个使用大型语言模型和问题原型来生成可泛化的启发式集成映射框架，能够实现训练一次、广泛适应的SAT求解器配置方法，在跨域泛化方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDCL求解器的性能依赖于内部启发式配置，但SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置无法实现。现有的自动化方法虽然能为特定问题族找到专门配置，但缺乏泛化性且需要为新的问题类型重新优化，成本高昂。

Method: 提出DaSAThco框架，使用大型语言模型在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专门启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制来形成最终的映射关系。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越的性能，特别是在非自适应方法表现有限的领域外泛化方面表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析方法难以捕捉复杂经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响了可靠性。大语言模型虽具备强大文本理解能力，但需要更好的方法来利用其金融知识。

Method: AD-FCoT框架结合类比推理和思维链提示，引导LLM在新事件与已知结果的历史场景间建立类比，并生成结构化逐步推理链，无需额外训练数据或微调。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验显示，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性和市场回报相关性方面均优于强基线方法，生成的解释与领域专业知识一致。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT是首批在金融领域明确结合类比示例与思维链推理的方法之一，为现实世界金融分析提供了可解释的见解，展现了纯提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

TL;DR: GBV-SQL是一个多智能体框架，通过SQL2Text反向翻译验证来解决Text2SQL中的语义鸿沟问题，同时揭示了基准测试数据中的系统性质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text2SQL生成中存在语义鸿沟问题，即使语法正确的SQL查询也可能误解用户意图，同时现有基准测试数据存在大量标注错误，影响模型性能评估。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，引入引导生成和SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，使用专门智能体将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言以验证逻辑一致性。建立了'Gold Errors'类型学来识别基准数据中的标注错误。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%执行准确率（提升5.8%）。在去除错误样本后，在Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）的执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，还揭示了基准测试完整性的关键问题，强调了更严格数据集管理的必要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Result: RF模型在所有数据集上表现最佳，当包含天气和年龄因素时达到R²=0.973、RMSE=0.040、MAE=0.033，显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 随机森林是预测牛群体重增长的强大工具，天气和年龄因素对预测准确性有重要影响，开发的自动化预处理工具可为后续研究提供基准数据集。

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种创新的ECG编码方法，将心电图信号转换为通用ECG语言，解决了LLM在心电图分析中的迁移性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在心电图分析中存在三个主要问题：模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer架构难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、黑盒特性限制临床应用。

Method: 提出ECG-aBcDe编码方法，构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，无需修改架构即可直接微调预训练LLM，实现双向可转换性和时间尺度信息的显式表示。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR上表现有竞争力，BLEU-4指标显著提升，在数据集内和跨数据集评估中分别提升2.8倍和3.9倍，达到42.58和30.76分。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，证明了该方法的可行性，具有'一次构建，随处使用'的能力和显著的可解释性提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Motivation: 传统约束松弛方法依赖专家经验且缺乏系统性自动化，现有LLM优化方法主要作为被动约束验证器，无法处理非线性组合优化问题中复杂的约束交互

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过三元表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码；建立双向（全局-局部）协同进化机制，将进化算法与蒙特卡洛树搜索相结合

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的非线性组合优化基准测试中验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能表现

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法革新了非线性组合优化问题的解决方式，实现了系统化的自动约束优化

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索降低推理计算成本的方法。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型，采用思维链提示和思维模型技术，并设计神经符号架构将问题转化为标准化形式后用Z3求解器处理。

Result: 从2023到2024年性能提升归因于思维链提示，2024到2025年思维模型带来显著改进。神经符号方法在保持近乎完美性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间持续提升，神经符号架构是降低计算成本的有效方法，FLOPs估算公式在实际应用中准确度较高。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图推理方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在开发一种无需训练、灵活且可扩展的通用图推理框架。

Method: 将目标图存储在图数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，包含错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务达到100%准确率（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径、最大流等），子图匹配性能也很高，能有效扩展到10,000节点的大图，且token成本与图大小无关。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种高效、准确且可扩展的训练免费图推理解决方案，通过结合RAG和LLM代码生成能力，克服了传统方法的限制。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将知识和经验视为单一整体，导致知识转移效率低下和粗粒度。需要一种更细粒度的方法来提升知识转移的效果。

Method: 提出分层内存架构，将高级规划内存与低级执行内存解耦。通过分层后见反思机制(H²R)，从过往代理-环境交互中精炼可重用的分层知识。在测试时分别检索高级和低级内存。

Result: 在两个标准测试集上，H²R在泛化能力和决策性能方面都取得了显著提升，表现超过了Expel等以往的基线方法。

Conclusion: 分层内存架构和H²R机制能够有效提升LLM基于代理的知识转移效果，通过细粒度的知识组织和检索方式，为多任务场景下的知识利用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLSMAC是一个基于三十六计的新型多智能体强化学习基准，包含12个精心设计的星际争霸II场景，专注于评估高层战略决策能力，超越了传统微操基准的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL基准（如SMAC）主要关注微操层面，缺乏对高层战略智能的全面评估，需要新的基准来推动多智能体战略决策能力的发展。

Method: 基于三十六计设计12个星际争霸II场景，每个场景对应特定计谋，引入多维度评估指标（能力利用率和推进效率等），集成最先进的MARL算法和LLM智能体进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明HLSMAC能够有效评估多智能体的战略决策能力，为推进多智能体战略决策研究提供了强大的测试平台。

Conclusion: HLSMAC成功填补了MARL基准在高层战略评估方面的空白，为多智能体战略决策研究提供了全面可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

TL;DR: FSRL是一种透明的对齐框架，通过训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器的可解释特征，实现与RLHF相当的效果但具有更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF方法导致参数变化分散且不透明，难以理解模型内部学到了什么，需要更透明的对齐方法。

Method: 使用特征引导强化学习(FSRL)，训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器(SAE)提取的可解释特征。

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与当前RLHF方法效果相当，机制分析发现适配器策略系统性地提升风格特征而非明确的对齐概念。

Conclusion: FSRL为可解释的模型控制和诊断对齐机制提供了工具，揭示了偏好优化过程可能将风格呈现作为质量的代理来奖励。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

TL;DR: 提出Evo-Merging方法，通过进化算法实现黑盒大语言模型的合并，仅需推理API查询，无需模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法需要访问模型参数，但对于GPT-4等仅通过API提供的黑盒大模型，参数不可用，这给模型合并带来挑战

Method: 基于进化算法的无导数优化框架，包含稀疏性去噪和符号感知缩放两个关键组件，通过API查询实现模型合并

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进结果，显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging方法有效解决了黑盒大语言模型合并的挑战，为无法访问模型权重的情况提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀差分隐私策略对所有数据一视同仁保护，导致模型性能显著降低，隐私敏感领域的持续学习模型部署遇到挑战

Method: 1. 标记级动态差分隐私策略：根据词汇语义敏感性自适应分配隐私预算
2. 隐私引导内存雕塑模块：利用敏感性分析智能遗忘敏感信息，明确保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 实验结果显示PeCL在隐私保护和模型性能之间完成优异平衡，在保持前续任务高精度的同时确保健壮的隐私保护，表现超过基线模型

Conclusion: PeCL框架通过动态隐私分配和有选择性遗忘机制，有效解决了持续学习中的隐私挑战，为隐私敏感领域的CL模型部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

TL;DR: Planning Copilot是一个集成多种规划工具的聊天机器人，通过自然语言指令调用工具，显著提升LLMs在长期规划任务中的表现，甚至优于更大的商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在自主执行复杂任务时缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要外部工具支持来弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 利用模型上下文协议(MCP)标准连接LLMs与外部规划工具，支持语法检查、规划器选择、调用、验证和模拟执行等规划任务，无需领域特定的微调。

Result: 实验表明Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLMs时显著优于不使用规划工具的相同LLMs，并且在有限定性比较中明显优于最新的商业模型GPT-5。

Conclusion: 专用规划工具是使LLMs能够有效执行规划任务的有效途径，MCP协议为LLMs与外部工具集成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证安娜·卡列尼娜原则（成功需要满足少量必要条件，失败形式多样）及其变体在不同文本媒介中的适用性，探究成功与失败的结构模式差异

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转换顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影四种媒介

Result: 不同媒介呈现不同的结构原则：小说顺序上遵循反向AKP；维基百科结合AKP与有序模式；学术论文顺序反向AKP但位置噪声；电影类型间存在分化

Conclusion: 成功依赖于特定媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态，结构模式具有媒介特异性

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Method: 开发MiniAgentPro可视化平台，包含直观的地图编辑器用于定制环境，以及带有流畅动画的模拟播放器。基于此工具创建包含8个不同事件场景的测试集（基础版和困难版变体）。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行的评估显示，在基础设置中代理表现强劲，但在困难变体中突显了协调挑战。

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro平台为LLM代理在物理环境中的能力评估提供了有效的可视化工具，揭示了当前代理在复杂协调任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social

platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个新的大学招生问题标准测试集，用于评估大语言模型在匹配问题中的性能，发现虽然某些模型能满足部分约束，但彻底满足所有评估标准仍有困难，且提示策略的效果不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学和组合优化任务上表现出艰，但在需要在偏好和结构约束下进行推理的匹配问题上仍然研究不足。需要开发一个标准测试集来系统评估LLM在这类问题中的性能。

Method: 构建了369个大学招生问题实例的标准测试集，从可行性、稳定性和最优性三个关键维度评估多个开源LLM的性能。测试了不同的提示策略，包括思维链、上下文学习和角色基于提示，以及迭代提示与自动生成反馈的结合。

Result: 结果显示LLM能满足某些约束，但无法一贯满足所有评估标准。推理能力强的模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著超过传统模型（如Llama、Qwen或Mistral）。不同提示策略的效果差异显著且没有一种提示在所有情况下都最优。迭代提示的性能并非单调增长，可能在早期达到峰值后减退。

Conclusion: 这项工作为模型推理性能和提示策略在带有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新视角，强调了在这些领域中进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图的冲突集提取算法G-CSEA，用于从伪布尔约束中高效提取不可约不可行子集(IIS)，解决传统方法在调度问题中求解次数多或失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力调度中存在大量基于规则的约束，这些约束可能相互冲突导致模型不可行。传统IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量可行性检查，而双射线分析在伪布尔模型中可能失效。

Method: 提出G-CSEA算法，受SAT求解器中冲突驱动子句学习启发，在约束传播过程中构建蕴含图，检测到冲突时追踪所有决策分支中的贡献约束来提取冲突集，可选使用QuickXplain最小化为IIS。

Result: 该方法能够有效提取伪布尔约束模型中的冲突集，避免了传统方法的大量求解调用和双射线分析的局限性。

Conclusion: G-CSEA为处理伪布尔约束的调度问题提供了一种高效的冲突诊断方法，通过图分析和冲突追踪机制提升了IIS提取的效率。

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病检测AI系统主要提供二进制转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制了临床信任和实用性。需要找到最有效的输出格式来提升医生与AI的协作性能。

Method: 使用IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集，测试GPT-4o和MedGemma两款MLLM模型。进行三个实验：(1)基准评估 (2)使用合成预测模拟AI协助 (3)实际AI之间协作，让GPT-4o结合MedGemma的输出。

Result: MedGemma在基准测试中表现更优，敏感度和AUROC更高；GPT-4o特异性近于完美但敏感度低。在实际协作中，GPT-4o在MedGemma描述性输出指导下取得了强劲结果（AUROC达0.96）。

Conclusion: MLLM可能改善糖尿病视网膜病筛查流程，并作为可扩展的模拟器研究临床AI协助。过渐、轻量模型如MedGemma在资源稀缺环境中特别价值，描述性输出可提升可解释性和临床信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: COLMA架构为AGI的实用化发展做出了贡献，提供了支持持续学习和人类推理能力的记忆系统设计框架

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven

next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that

### [42] [RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13281)
*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念向量提取框架，能够从少量数据中分离出特定概念的表示，实现对LLM行为的精准干预，同时引发了对模型安全性的新担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生比预期更广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预，从而更精细地理解LLM行为。

Method: 提出了RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式分离概念特定的表示，能够从仅十几个示例中提取稳健的目标表示，并定位到100-200个神经元。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上，RepIt能够选择性抑制特定概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他地方的拒绝能力，使模型能够回答WMD相关问题但在标准基准测试中仍保持安全评分。

Conclusion: 通过RepIt分离拒绝向量，证明了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化，为更精细的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但同时也引发了关于计算和数据需求较低可能带来的安全风险的担忧。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition是一种新的计算认知建模范式，通过记忆化的知识星座来简化认知负荷，支持模式识别、类比推理等人类式认知方式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言智能体(LEIAs)开发一种能够像人类一样处理现实生活复杂性的计算认知模型，通过典型性预期和模式识别来最小化认知负荷

Method: 基于形状的建模方法，包括特定目标、假设、建模策略、知识库和实际模型实现，在特定认知架构中构建记忆化的多模态知识星座

Result: 提出了一个具体的、可验证的形状建模框架，能够处理广泛现象，支持异常情况下的恢复方法（如即时学习、寻求人类帮助）

Conclusion: 形状认知范式不仅适用于语言智能体，其原则可以更广泛地应用于知识驱动和混合AI系统，为构建可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的智能体系统提供了新途径

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

TL;DR: 为解决荷兰语言在多语言嵌入资源中代表性不足的问题，研究团队发布了荷兰语嵌入模型评测基准(MTEB-NL)、训练数据集和高效嵌入模型E5-NL系列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源（模型、基准测试和数据集）中代表性不足，仅占小部分比例，需要提供专门资源来推动荷兰语嵌入技术的发展。

Method: 1. 构建荷兰语嵌入评测基准MTEB-NL，包含现有数据集和新创建数据集，覆盖多种任务类型
2. 编译荷兰语检索数据集，并使用大语言模型生成合成数据扩展任务覆盖范围
3. 发布E5-NL系列嵌入模型，具有简洁高效的特点

Result: 研究团队成功开发了一套完整的荷兰语嵌入资源，包括评测基准、训练数据和嵌入模型，并通过Hugging Face Hub和MTEB包公开发布。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中的空白，为荷兰语嵌入模型的评估和发展提供了重要支持，将促进该领域的进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事构建的人类验证基准，用于评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现大型模型虽然表现更好但仍易受对抗性攻击影响，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上的优异表现，需要评估它们在复杂抽象推理和推断方面的能力，特别是道德推理等深层理解技能。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，采用多项选择题形式测试道德推理，并设计对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但对对抗性操作敏感，经常依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理，最佳模型在约20%的情况下会自我反驳。推理增强模型未能弥补这一差距。

Conclusion: 规模而非推理能力是性能的主要驱动因素，LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，容易受到提示框架的影响而产生自相矛盾。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究使用LLM作为评判员来评估法律领域的推荐系统，解决传统评估指标无法抓取专业领域精细质量的问题。研究发现Gwet's AC2和排序相关系数比传统一致性指标更适合选择LLM评判员，Wilcoxon签名排序检验则提供了统计严谨的系统比较方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统推荐系统评估指标无法抓取法律研究等专业领域的精细质量维度。需要一种可靠的方法来评估LLM在高风险场景下的推荐质量。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，通过系统实验比较不同评估者一致性指标（如Krippendorff's alpha、Gwet's AC2、排序相关系数）的表现，并使用Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test进行统计显著性检验。

Result: 发现传统一致性指标在AI系统评估的偏斜分布中容易导致误导，Gwet's AC2和排序相关系数更适合选择LLM评判员，Wilcoxon检验能提供可靠的系统比较。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的评估框架，能够将原本以人工为主的评估瓶颈转化为自动化但统计严谨的方法，特别适用于法律应用等高精度要求的领域。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强和广泛使用，检测未声明的AI生成文本的需求日益重要

Method: 使用selected-next-token-probability序列的Transformer编码器，通过对比预训练在大规模无标签数据上训练

Result: 在3个公开数据集、24个文本领域的实验中，SENTRA在跨域设置下显著优于流行基线方法

Conclusion: SENTRA是一个通用的分类器，能有效检测LLM生成的文本

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

TL;DR: MORQA是一个多语言医疗问答评估基准，通过专家标注和LLM评估方法，发现基于大语言模型的评估器在医疗NLG评估中显著优于传统指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的自然语言生成评估具有独特挑战，传统自动评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE）在区分高质量医疗问答输出方面存在不足，特别是面对开放式医疗问答任务时

Method: 构建MORQA多语言基准，包含英语和中文的医疗视觉和文本问答数据集，每个问题有2-4+个医学专家编写的参考答案，并使用专家人工评分。对比评估传统指标和基于LLM（GPT-4、Gemini）的评估器

Result: 基于LLM的评估方法在相关性方面显著优于传统指标，LLM对语义细微差别敏感且对参考答案的变异性具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 这是医疗领域首个全面的多语言NLG评估定性研究，强调了需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开以支持未来研究

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

TL;DR: MedFact是一个新的中文医疗事实核查基准，包含2116个专家标注实例，涵盖13个医学专业和8种错误类型，用于评估LLMs在医疗领域的事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在医疗领域的数据范围有限，无法捕捉真实世界医疗信息的复杂性，需要更严格的评估标准来确保LLMs在医疗应用中的事实可靠性。

Method: 采用混合AI-人工框架，通过迭代专家反馈优化AI驱动的多标准筛选过程，构建高质量、高难度的数据集，并对20个领先LLMs进行真实性分类和错误定位的全面评估。

Result: 模型通常能判断文本是否包含错误，但精确定位错误仍具挑战性，即使表现最好的模型也达不到人类专家水平。还发现模型存在'过度批评'现象，容易将正确信息误判为错误。

Conclusion: MedFact突显了在医疗应用中部署LLMs的关键挑战，为开发更事实可靠和医学感知的模型提供了强大资源。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

TL;DR: TopicK是一个基于主题覆盖的检索框架，通过识别测试输入所需的细粒度知识主题并评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平，迭代选择能够覆盖模型知识薄弱主题的演示样本，从而提升上下文学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法通常仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率来检索演示样本，这往往导致选择不相关或冗余的示例，无法全面覆盖测试输入所需的细粒度知识需求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计输入所需的主题知识；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入模型知识薄弱且未被覆盖的主题的演示样本。

Result: 在多个数据集和开源/闭源大语言模型上进行了广泛实验，验证了TopicK的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK通过主题覆盖的方法能够更有效地选择相关演示样本，提升上下文学习的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在教育技术中的应用需要关注细粒度语言现象的理解，确保语言清晰性以支持有效学习

Method: 构建LUCID数据集（英语和孜加拉语句子对），使用RECISE指南进行结构化评估，采用相关系数、MAE和新的HCE准确率指标

Result: Compound-Beta模型表现最佳，在英语中获得最高相关系数，在跨语言场景下与人类判断有强对齐性

Conclusion: 语言模型在细粒度语言理解方面仍面临挑战，Compound-Beta模型显示出在跨语言人类对齐方面的优势

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接人工监督或高质量标签稀缺的情况下，训练任务特定的小型推理模型具有挑战性。大语言模型产生的丰富中间推理轨迹可以系统提炼为有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1) 从开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2) 提炼这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性，形成高保真数据集；3) 进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，校准模型的中间推理。

Result: 在数据库系统设计的扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务上进行了案例研究，构建了包含600个EERD变体的数据集。实证评估表明该方法在数据稀缺领域有效。

Conclusion: R2tA为数据稀缺领域的可扩展LLM适应提供了实用且成本效益高的路径，能够为教育等领域开发可复现的AI工具。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

Motivation: 虽然ASR技术近年来取得显著进展，但大语言模型容易产生幻觉问题，这会严重影响实际ASR应用中的用户体验。现有LLM-based ASR系统在开源基准上表现良好，但在真实工业评估集上往往表现不佳。

Method: 结合大规模数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，特别针对流式处理能力、噪声鲁棒性、代码切换、热词定制等实际应用需求进行优化。

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR通过面向生产的优化，成功解决了LLM-based ASR系统在真实工业环境中的性能问题，展示了在实际部署中的优越表现。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发高效的郭卡语（非洲布隆纳法索地区主要语言）机器翻译系统，比较不同训练方法在语言资源稀缺情况下的表现

Method: 使用三种模型训练流水线：1）基础transformer模型直接训练；2）对LLaMA3 instructor模型进行精调；3）语言蓄约技术与LaBSE模型集成，通过BERT扩展生成翻译

Result: 简单transformer模型在Bayelemagaba数据集上获得10% BLEU和21% chrF分数，在Yiri数据集上达到33.81% BLEU和41% chrF，表现最佳。LLaMA3 instructor模型在单个数据集上表现更好，但在聚合数据上表现不如前者

Conclusion: 在语言资源稀缺的情况下，简单的transformer模型直接训练方案反而能获得更好的翻译效果，这与低资源翻译的典型结果一致

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

TL;DR: 零梭学习音频标题生成系统，利用预训练音频CLIP模型和大语言模型，通过结构化提示和音频对齐精炼来提高标题生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动音频标题生成领域因数据集有限而面临的挑战，避免需要大量训练数据的问题

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征，生成结构化提示引导大语言模型生成标题，通过音频CLIP模型精炼关键词选择确保与音频内容对齐

Result: 实验结果显示使用MAGIC搜索和WavCaps模型时，NLG平均分数提高35%（从4.7到7.3），性能受音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择影响显著

Conclusion: 单个关键词提示能获得最佳性能，不使用关键词列表会导致性能下降50%，证明了音频对齐精炼在零梭学习音频标题生成中的关键作用

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

TL;DR: 本文提出EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和多样化并行强化学习，在保持性能的同时将计算成本降低至基准方法的12%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM定理证明方法存在计算开销过大的问题，现有成本分析通常只关注采样次数而忽略了不同扩展策略带来的采样成本差异

Method: 提出两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制减少不必要的token消耗；2）多样化并行强化学习配合可训练前缀，在有限采样次数下提高通过率

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上，EconProver仅用基准方法12%的计算成本就达到了可比性能

Conclusion: 这项工作为部署轻量级定理证明模型提供了可行方案，在不牺牲性能的前提下显著降低计算成本

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE位置编码存在内在的距离依赖偏差，限制了长上下文建模能力，且现有扩展方法需要预训练后的调整

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，在注意力机制中引入可学习相位函数

Result: TAPA能保持长距离token交互，通过轻量微调扩展到更长上下文，外推到未见长度，在长上下文任务上获得显著更低的困惑度

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的长上下文位置编码方法，优于现有的RoPE系列方法

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的自动语音识别系统中有效发音建模和鲁棒同音词区分的两大关键挑战，这对于原始词和长尾词识别至关重要

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：1)发音引导的上下文学习方法，使用交错字形-音素上下文建模策略；2)发音判别强化学习方法，通过扰动标签采样增强同音词区分能力

Result: 在英文Librispeech和中文AISHELL-1数据集上，相比预训练LLM-ASR模型，WER相对降低30.2%和53.8%；长尾词的偏置WER相对降低31.8%和60.5%

Conclusion: PAC框架有效提升了LLM-ASR系统的发音建模和同音词区分能力，在英语和中文语音识别任务上都取得了显著性能提升

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在产品中的普及，它们的输出可能影响公众意见。如果模型能够被偶像地向特定意识形态偏向，控制者将获得不成比例的影响力。需要方法来检测这种偏向尝试。

Method: 采用模型无关的统计方法，通过分析模型在与特定主题相关的提示下输出的分布移动来识别意识形态偏向。方法不需要访问模型内部结构。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的实际可用性，证明其能够支持对专有黑盒系统进行独立的后约审计。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的方法来检测大语言模型是否被偶像地向特定意识形态偏向，对于维护公共议程的公正性具有重要意义。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

Motivation: 大语言模型在情感支持对话中存在策略规划准确性低和明显的策略偏好偏差问题，而现有方法对这种偏差的根本原因研究不深入。

Method: 首先揭示知识边界导致的根本偏差原因，然后提出基于增强学习的双重奖励函数方法，通过准确性和基于熵的信心度优化策略规划。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在多个大语言模型背景下都超过了基线方法，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地揭示了大语言模型策略偏好偏差的根本原因，并通过创新的增强学习方法有效减少了这种偏差，显著提升了情感支持对话的质量。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决文本人物搜索中高质量文本注释获取劳动密集、成本高的问题，提高系统可扩展性和实际部署能力

Method: 提出两个相互补充模块：多轮文本生成(MTG)通过MLLM模拟对话生成丰富的伪标签；多轮文本交互(MTI)在推理时通过动态对话精细化用户查询

Result: 方法在不需人工标注的情况下实现了竞争性或更优的检索准确性，提高了系统的健壮性和易用性

Conclusion: 该无监督框架为文本人物搜索系统的可扩展和实际部署推平了道路

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Motivation: 由于LLM生成内容的快速增长，传统基于人类文本训练的毒性分类器面临误分类问题，现有防御策略被动且效果有限，需要主动识别和修复模型脆弱性。

Method: 使用微调的BERT和RoBERTa分类器，采用对抗攻击技术识别脆弱电路，通过抑制这些脆弱组件来提升模型性能，并在多样化数据集上进行测试。

Result: 发现模型存在对性能关键或易受攻击的特定注意力头，抑制脆弱头能显著提升对抗输入的性能，不同人口群体间的脆弱性由不同注意力头负责。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能提高毒性检测模型的鲁棒性，还能为更包容的模型开发提供人口层面的洞察，有助于缩小公平性和鲁棒性差距。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码依赖于从文本生成模型中采样的文本，难以正确捕获域外知识或信息，需要一种能够更好处理域外领域的方法

Method: 提出基于案例的决策理论（CBDT）解码方法，使用领域数据样本来估计期望效用，并与MBR解码相结合

Result: CBDT解码不仅比MAP解码生成更高质量的文本，而且MBR与CBDT的组合在7个领域翻译任务（De-En和Ja↔En）以及MSCOCO和nocaps数据集的图像描述任务中优于单独的MBR解码

Conclusion: CBDT解码是一种有效的替代方法，能够更好地处理域外知识问题，与MBR解码结合使用可以进一步提升文本生成质量

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Result: GPT4o在所有任务和语言中表现最佳，Gemma-2在小型模型中表现最优。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进多语言和时间感知的历史事件自然语言理解提供了全面资源，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

Conclusion: 通过分组对比损失训练，CLEAR GLASS模型能够在不直接接触高层概念的情况下，在潜在语义空间中形成接近高层概念的语义表示，从而获得概念抽象能力

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Conclusion: 通过跨语言增强技术，阿拉伯语资源可以有效支持马耳他语的自然语言处理，为语言资源较少的语言提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

*Shiyu Li,Yang Tang,Ruijie Liu,Shi-Zhe Chen,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Conan-embedding-v2是一个14亿参数的新语言模型，通过从头训练和专门针对文本嵌入任务的微调，在MTEB和中英文MTEB基准测试中实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作通常使用LoRA微调现有LLMs，但受到LLMs与嵌入模型之间的数据和训练差距限制。需要解决因果掩码与双向掩码、token级损失与句子级损失之间的训练差异问题。

Method: 1) 添加新闻数据和多语言对进行LLM预训练以弥合数据差距；2) 提出跨语言检索数据集；3) 引入软掩码机制在两种掩码类型间平滑过渡；4) 提出动态硬负样本挖掘方法。

Result: 仅使用约14亿参数，Conan-embedding-v2在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)和中文MTEB (2025年5月19日)上均实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过从头训练、跨语言数据增强、软掩码机制和动态负样本挖掘，成功解决了LLMs与嵌入模型之间的训练差距问题，实现了参数效率高的高性能文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种面向推理任务的图基信心估计方法，通过建模推理路径并利用图论特性来提高大语言模型的信心估计准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的信心估计方法主要为事实问答任务设计，在推理任务上效果不佳，需要专门的方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一系列无需训练的图基信心估计方法，将推理路径模型为有向图，利用图的中心性、路径收敛和路径权重等属性进行信心估计。

Result: 在2个大语言模型和3个推理数据集上的实验显示，该方法在信心估计和两个下游任务上都取得了改进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为推理任务提供了一种有效的信心估计方法，通过图论方法能够更准确地评估大语言模型在复杂推理任务上的可靠性。

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 提供了自动化工作流生成的技术框架和过程导向视角，有助于科学范式演变的实证研究

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReLoRA在小型语言模型(11M-66M参数)预训练中的系统研究表明，其性能普遍不如标准训练，且模型越大差距越明显，低秩更新策略可能不适用于SLM预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReLoRA方法在小型语言模型预训练中的表现，因为虽然LoRA在微调中表现出色，但其在预训练特别是小模型中的应用效果尚不明确，而小模型具有计算和环境成本更低的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验系统评估ReLoRA在11M-66M参数小型语言模型上的性能表现和学习动态，比较标准训练与ReLoRA在损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP等指标上的差异。

Result: ReLoRA在所有评估指标上普遍表现不如标准训练，且随着模型规模增大，性能差距更加明显。学习动态分析显示ReLoRA会加剧小模型中已有的秩缺陷问题。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能无法轻易迁移到小型语言模型预训练中，需要在低计算资源环境下进行更多相关研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Method: 研究编译了包含8k中文和16k英文酒评论的并行语料库，对神经机器翻译基线模型和最新的大语言模型进行了测试。提出了三个文化定向的人工评估标准：文化亲近性、文化中立性和文化真实性。

Result: 分析显示当前的模型在捕捉文化细腻方面仍然遇到困难，特别是在不同文化间翻译酒类描述时。这也显示了翻译模型在处理文化内容时的挑战和局限性。

Conclusion: 这项研究突出了现有翻译模型在处理文化内容时的不足，并为文化透视的语言任务提供了新的评估框架和研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有坐姿监测系统识别粒度粗糙且缺乏语义表达能力，无法提供个性化反馈，长期不良坐姿会导致肌肉骨骼疾病

Method: 包含三个核心模块：高斯鲁棒传感器嵌入模块（空间分块和局部噪声扰动）、提示驱动的跨模态对齐模块（通过多头交叉注意力将传感器嵌入重编程到LLM语义空间）、多上下文提示模块（融合多层级上下文信息）

Result: 提出了一个能够实现细粒度坐姿理解和生成个性化健康导向响应的框架

Conclusion: SitLLM框架通过多模态融合和LLM的语义理解能力，解决了传统坐姿监测系统的局限性，为个性化健康管理提供了新方案

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在专业领域应用受限于领域特定训练数据稀缺和复杂性的问题

Method: 利用GPT-4o和o3-mini多模型生成技术，将AIS船舶轨迹记录转换为合成问答对，然后对Qwen2.5-7B模型进行精细调整

Result: 精细调整后的小模型在海事任务上达到75%准确率，成本比直接使用大模型推理降低261倍

Conclusion: 通过合成数据生成技术，小型便宜模型也能在专业领域达到类似大模型的性能，为无法手动注释的领域提供了可复现框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成符合复杂定性目标（如教学合理性）的输出方面存在挑战，传统强化学习方法依赖昂贵评估或脆弱的关键词指标，无法捕捉高质量解释的语义本质

Method: 在GRPO框架中使用小型高效的编码器变换器作为语义奖励模型，基于生成解释与真实参考之间的余弦相似度提供密集的语义丰富奖励信号

Result: 在意大利医学院入学考试任务中，该方法显著提高了解释的忠实性和清晰度，优于强监督微调基线

Conclusion: 使用轻量级编码器模型进行细致奖励塑造在复杂生成任务中具有强大潜力

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体方法存在两个主要问题：直接生成底层动作不可靠，而高层任务规划又依赖专家经验来转换为具体动作序列。需要一种能够在复杂长时域环境中有效落地的解决方案。

Method: 提出PLAP（Plan with Language, Act with Parameter）规划框架，包含三个核心组件：环境特定的参数化技能库、LLM驱动的技能规划器、将参数化技能转换为可执行动作序列的技能执行器。

Result: 在MicroRTS实时策略游戏中，GPT-4o驱动的零样本PLAP超越80%基线智能体，Qwen2-72B驱动的少样本PLAP甚至超越了顶级脚本智能体CoacAI。建立了LLM长时域技能规划能力排行榜。

Conclusion: PLAP框架有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂长时域环境中的落地问题，通过分离语言规划和参数化执行，实现了可靠的环境交互，为LLM智能体的实际应用提供了有力支撑。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受外部知识覆盖范围限制，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差。需要新的方法来提高检测效果和鲁棒性

Method: HSAD框架：1) 跨层采样激活构建隐藏层信号 2) 应用快速傅里叶变换获得频域表示 3) 提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征 4) 利用LLMs的自回归特性识别最佳观测点

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比先前最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLMs中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

Motivation: 挑战传统少样本学习的认知，研究过度提示现象及其对LLM性能的影响，特别是在软件工程需求分析领域的应用

Method: 使用三种少样本选择方法（随机采样、语义嵌入、TF-IDF向量），在多个LLM上进行评估，通过逐步增加TF-IDF选择的分层少样本示例数量来确定最优数量

Result: 实验显示过多领域特定示例会降低某些LLM性能，确定了每个LLM的最佳示例数量，在功能和非功能需求分类任务上性能提升1%

Conclusion: 过度提示确实存在，需要为不同LLM确定最优示例数量，TF-IDF选择的分层方法能以更少示例获得更好性能，避免过度提示问题

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

Motivation: 虽然LLMs在心理应用中部署越来越多，但它们在自然对话环境中识别人格特质的能力仍未经过充分研究

Method: 构建包含半结构化记录和连续性Big Five特质评分的新标准数据集，通过三种方法评估LLMs：零样本和思维链提示法（GPT-4.1 Mini）、LoRA微调法（RoBERTa和Meta-LLaMA）、以及使用BERT和OpenAI嵌入的回归分析

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质的Pearson相关系数均低于0.26，思维链提示法比零样本提示法收益微小

Conclusion: 现有LLMs与验证心理定量的对齐度有限，人格推理更依赖潜在语义表征而非显式理性思维，需要特征特定提示、上下文感知和对齐微调等方向的进一步研究

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 研究表明，融入人类注视信息可以有效提升图表导向大型视觉语言模型的推理质量和可解释性，展示了人类注视数据在改进视觉语言模型方面的潜力。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Result: 在6个具有挑战性的基准测试中实现最先进性能，甚至超越前沿专有系统，训练数据显著提升传统方法的工具使用能力

Conclusion: 该框架通过并行思维自然扩展，支持并发多智能体探索，能够产生更全面的结论，为构建自主知识发现AI代理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

Motivation: 现有的基础模型在自主工具使用任务中表现不佳，需要同时学习多样化行为和对齐专家示范，导致优化冲突

Method: 提出Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT)方法，将持续预训练组织到深度研究模型训练流程中，开发AgentFounder-30B模型

Result: 在10个测试集上达到state-of-the-art性能：BrowseComp-en 39.9%，BrowseComp-zh 43.3%，HLE Pass@1 31.5%，保持强大工具使用能力

Conclusion: Agentic CPT方法能够构建强大的自主模型基础，有效解决了现有模型在自主工具使用任务中的性能问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

Motivation: 现实世界API需要精确、鲁棒的函数调用智能，而智能体能力的广度与其训练环境的多样性密切相关。为了解决环境规模化构建和有效训练的两大核心挑战。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展框架来自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，系统性地拓宽函数调用场景空间。采用两阶段智能体微调策略：先赋予基础智能体能力，再进行领域专业化。

Result: 在tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等智能体基准测试上的广泛实验表明，训练出的AgentScaler模型显著增强了模型的函数调用能力。

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境构建和两阶段训练策略，成功提升了大型语言模型在实际应用中的函数调用智能，为部署实用智能体系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

Motivation: 解决当前开放深度研究(OEDR)中存在的静态研究流程和一次性生成范式导致的长文本失效问题和幻觉问题

Method: 采用双智能体框架：规划器动态迭代地交织证据获取和提纲优化，生成基于证据的全面提纲；写作者执行分层检索和写作过程，逐节撰写报告

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepConsult和DeepResearchGym等主要OEDR基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 验证了以人为中心的迭代方法，证明自适应规划和聚焦合成对于生成高质量、可靠且结构良好的报告至关重要

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum是一种新的LLM网络代理范式，通过周期性上下文摘要实现无限探索，解决了ReAct等方法的上下文窗口限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的网络代理在处理知识密集型任务时表现良好，但受到上下文窗口限制的阻碍。复杂查询涉及多个实体、交织关系和高不确定性，需要大量搜索周期，在达到完整解决方案之前就迅速耗尽上下文预算。

Method: 引入ReSum范式，通过定期上下文摘要将不断增长的交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态，保持对先前发现的感知同时绕过上下文约束。提出ReSum-GRPO，集成GRPO与分段轨迹训练和优势广播，使代理适应基于摘要的推理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSum相比ReAct平均绝对提升4.5%，经过ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步提升达8.2%。WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%，超越了现有开源网络代理。

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要机制有效解决了LLM网络代理的上下文窗口限制问题，实现了更好的性能和无限探索能力，为复杂网络任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 近期的解释性方法使用第二个语言模型将LLM内部表征转换为自然语言描述，但研究发现这些法通常反映了语言模型的参数知识而非目标模型的激活信息，需要更严格的评测标准和实验控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估活化解释方法是否真正能够揭示LLM的内部工作机制，还是仅仅传递输入信息或语言模型的参数知识。

Method: 在以前工作使用的数据集上评估流行的活化方法，运行受控实验来分析活化内容的来源。

Result: 发现活化方法在无法访问目标模型内部状态的情况下仍能在基准测试中获得成功，活化内容常常反映了语言模型的参数知识而非目标模型的激活信息。

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试集和实验控制来严格评估活化方法是否能够提供对LLM运作机制的有效见解。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割算法的泛化能力，在乳腺MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并展示了在临床术前规划和患者教育中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在处理多样化数据集时泛化能力不足，需要开发能够跨数据集和成像场景泛化的准确算法来支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 采用三阶段处理流程：1) 乳腺MRI数据的匿名化和手动分割；2) 配准和分割全乳腺、纤维腺体组织和肿瘤；3) 使用ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化。采用人机协同方法，利用U-Mamba架构优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：全器官DSC 0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织DSC 0.96±0.024，肿瘤DSC 0.82±0.12。成功生成准确的3D重建，能够可视化复杂解剖特征。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的3D重建和解剖分割算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并促进了更有效的患者教育和共享决策。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

Motivation: 手动分析放射后TRISO粒子的形态变化效率低且主观，需要自动化方法来获取统计信息

Method: 构建包含2000张微观图像的数据集，使用U-Net、ResNet、Attention U-Net和自建RU-Net等CNN模型进行图像分割

Result: RU-Net模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，能够加速TRISO粒子截面分析

Conclusion: CNN模型可以显著减少手动劳动并提高分割结果的对象性

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

Motivation: 现有植物营养管理方法需要长时间分析，无法实现实时优化；成像技术虽然能快速表型定量，但计算复杂度高，在资源受限环境下部署困难。

Method: 使用多光谱成像技术，建立了一个包含自编码器异常检测的分层处理流程，并比较了两种不同复杂度的状态估计模块：植被指数特征统计学习方法和整形象深度学习方法。

Result: 异常检测在低能耗下实现高效率（73%异常检测率）；深度学习模型在磷和钙估计上表现更好（R2 0.61 vs 0.58），但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 该模块化处理流程为边缘计算环境下的农业诊断提供了实用方案，促进了农业可持续发展。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战。需要建立一个基准来评估LMMs在多模态幽默解释和叙事序列识别方面的能力。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，用于评估模型的多模态上下文和叙事推理能力。通过实验测试最先进的LMMs在面板排序等任务上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类表现水平，表明模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了一个严谨框架，旨在推动开发能够更好地参与自然、具有社会意识交互的LMMs，当前模型在多模态幽默理解方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

Conclusion: 证明了在线方法在真实人物交互场景中的优勃性，为机器学习、AR/VR等领域提供了更加实用的解决方案

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in

constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置(SB)影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量及其在图像分类任务中作用的理解。

Method: 1) 理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2) 提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3) 在CLIP模型上验证新方法，并研究SB与零样本和微调设置下图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新提出的频率感知SB测量方法比现有方法更有效和一致。实验发现SB强度与性能存在任务相关性：更强的SB与更好的OOD泛化性能相关，但与对抗鲁棒性的关系不同。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏置与目标任务特性的对齐很重要，SB的适当调整可以提升模型在特定任务上的性能表现。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

Result: 标尺和病灶分割Dice分别达到0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏图（仅使用25%边）AUC为0.9788，显著优于仅图像基线的0.9440

Conclusion: 融合校准尺度、病灶几何和元数据的群体图方法在ISIC-2019上相比仅图像管道有显著提升，稀疏图能保持接近最优精度，尺度感知的图AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像机器翻译研究主要关注全图像翻译，忽略了位置信息和边界框标注，且应用场景有限。需要支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译任务。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: 一种积合数据驱动和物理导向的深度学习方法，通过Amplifier Air-Transformer模型实现美国大陆区域小时级、2公里分辨率的空气温度穿时空无缺盒制图，验证准确度达1.93°C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有气象站点相对稀疏和卫星数据受云层遮挡的限制，提供空间和时间上无缺的空气温度数据。

Method: 首先通过编码年温度周期的神经网络重构GOES-16表面温度，包含线性放大器和卷积层捕捉空间时间变化；然后通过另一神经网络将表面温度转换为空气温度，并使用深度集成学习进行预测不确定性估计。

Result: 基于77.7亿像素表面温度数据和1.55亿条气象站数据（2018-2024年）训练测试，在站点验证中实现小时温度制图准确度1.93°C。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地重构表面温度并预测空气温度，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高空间时间分辨率的空气温度监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

Motivation: 探索在动物重识别任务中，通用预训练模型与领域专用模型作为骨干网络的效果差异，以及后处理度量学习对不同类型嵌入的改进效果。

Method: 使用通用模型DINOv2和领域专用模型MegaDescriptor作为骨干网络，采用K近邻分类器进行个体识别，并测试三元组学习投影头对两种模型的性能提升效果。

Result: 三元组学习对专用模型MegaDescriptor提升0.13分，但对通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于BAKS和BAUS指标）。通用模型的流形结构更难针对细粒度任务进行重塑。

Conclusion: 通用预训练特征在专业化、小数据量的重识别任务中存在明显局限性，领域特异性预训练对于此类任务至关重要。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，结构适配比知识蓄粉更有效，需要进一步研究高效模型设计和充分蓄粉技术

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮等机械装配体的耦合运动轨迹，解决了现有方法对简化运动结构或标注依赖的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体（如门、笔记本电脑）通常假设简化的运动学结构或依赖关节标注，但机械装配体（如齿轮）的运动来自几何耦合（啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何推理关系运动。

Method: 引入MechBench数据集（693个合成齿轮装配体）和DYNAMO模型（依赖感知神经网络），直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个部件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: DYNAMO在实验中优于强基线，在不同齿轮配置下实现准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了数据驱动学习CAD装配体中耦合机械运动的新系统框架。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花收获和高通量表型分析提供可靠基础

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该研究通过考虑生成过程中的分布差异，提出了一种有效的tokenizer训练方案，显著提升了图像生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

*Purushoth,Alireza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架，系统测试了视觉语言模型在噪声条件下的鲁棒性，包括光照变化、运动模糊和压缩伪影等扰动，发现模型大小、数据集特征和噪声弹性之间存在微妙权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，需要建立标准化评估基准。

Method: 使用受控扰动（光照变化、运动模糊、压缩伪影）评估多个SOTA VLMs，结合词汇指标（BLEU、METEOR等）和基于神经网络的句子嵌入相似度度量。

Result: 发现：1）真实标注的描述性显著影响性能；2）大模型如LLaVA在语义理解方面优秀但不总是优于小模型；3）JPEG压缩和运动模糊等噪声类型会显著降低所有模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特性和噪声弹性之间的权衡关系，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有弱监督语义分割方法在对象边界定位不精确和只关注最具判别性区域的问题，避免昂贵的像素级标注需求

Method: 提出IG-CAM方法，包含三个关键创新：实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强，利用实例级线索和影响函数生成高质量边界感知定位图

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上达到82.3% mIoU（后处理前）和86.6% mIoU（CRF后处理后），显著超越先前方法，展示了优异的定位精度和完整对象覆盖

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，为像素级标注不可用或成本过高的场景提供了实用解决方案，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from

3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and

Conclusion: 该方法成功将神经突然理论扩展到多标签联邦学习中，通过特征解耦和NC结构对齐，有效解决了异构数据带来的问题，为多标签FL领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了生态无效性问题，通过模拟人类偶像制作过程生成高质量数据，显著提升了检测器的实际效能

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中占主导地位，但无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合建模人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准上达到state-of-the-art性能，与更先进的目标检测器结合时性能显著提升，在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM方法通过显式建模关系结构和多级特征交互，有效提升了HOI检测性能，证明了图神经网络在该任务中的优势

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at

### [123] [MFAF: An EVA02-Based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion Method for Cross-View Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12673)
*YiTong Liu,TianZhu Liu,YanFeng GU*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于EVA02的多尺度频率注意力融合方法(MFAF)，通过多频率分支块和频率感知空间注意力模块，有效解决跨视角地理定位中的特征提取和视角变化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角地理定位任务面临显著的外观变化和特征提取困难，现有方法往往忽略空间和语义信息，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: MFAF方法包含多频率分支块(MFB)和频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块。MFB块在多尺度上捕获低频结构特征和高频边缘细节，FSA模块自适应关注频率特征的关键区域。

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等基准测试中，MFAF方法在无人机定位和导航任务中都取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过频率注意力融合机制有效提升了跨视角地理定位的特征表示一致性和鲁棒性，显著减少了背景噪声和视角变化的干扰。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

### [124] [A Comparative Study of YOLOv8 to YOLOv11 Performance in Underwater Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12682)
*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比了YOLOv8到YOLOv11四个版本在水下图像检测中的性能，发现YOLOv9之后准确性满足，而YOLOv10在精度和速度之间取得最佳平衡，适合自主水下潜器部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像受到光衰减、涨水和类别不平衡的影响，而AUV设备计算资源有限。虽然YOLO检测器在陆地地形上表现优异，但其在海洋领域的性能仍不明确。

Method: 使用两个公开水下数据集（珍琪疾病和鱼类），在四种不同训练数据量模式下训练YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s，使用相同超参数进行对比评估。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9之后的版本准确性提升进入平台期，而推理速度持续改善。YOLOv10在精度和速度之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 论文提供了YOLO模型在水下图像检测的首次系统对比，指出yOLOv10是嵌入式AUV部署的最佳选择，并提供了可复现的基准测试和代码库。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

TL;DR: StereoCarla是一个基于CARLA模拟器的高保真立体视觉数据集，专门为自动驾驶场景设计，通过多样化的相机配置和环境条件提升立体匹配模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的立体匹配训练数据多样性有限，限制了学习模型的泛化能力，需要更丰富多样的合成数据集来提升自动驾驶深度感知系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于CARLA模拟器构建StereoCarla数据集，包含多种相机配置（基线、视角、传感器位置）和环境条件（光照变化、天气效果、道路几何），并进行跨域实验验证。

Conclusion: StereoCarla为在真实、多样和可控环境下开发和评估立体算法提供了有价值的基准，有助于构建更鲁棒的自动驾驶深度感知系统。

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under
realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth
perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Code can be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期火灾场景中烟雾严重影响监控系统可见度，但缺乏大规模真实世界配对数据集限制了烟雾去除算法的发展

Method: 构建包含精确对齐的烟雾退化图像和清晰图像的真实世界监控图像数据集，涵盖多样化场景设置和烟雾浓度

Result: 创建了SmokeBench数据集并进行了全面的烟雾去除方法基准测试，为推进真实火灾场景中的图像去雾提供了宝贵基础

Conclusion: 该数据集解决了烟雾去除领域缺乏真实世界配对数据的问题，为开发鲁棒实用的图像去雾算法提供了重要资源

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

Motivation: 现有文本驱动的红外-可见光图像融合方法缺乏目标对齐的任务来监督和评估文本输入对融合结果的有效贡献。观察到参考图像分割(RIS)和文本驱动融合具有共同目标：突出文本所指的对象。

Method: 提出RIS-FUSION级联框架，核心是LangGatedFusion模块，将文本特征注入融合主干网络以增强语义对齐。构建了MM-RIS大规模基准数据集，包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试三元组（红外-可见光图像对、分割掩码和参考表达式）。

Conclusion: 通过统一融合和RIS任务的联合优化，RIS-FUSION有效解决了文本驱动图像融合中文本贡献评估的问题，并提供了大规模多模态基准数据集。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习面临属性与对象纠缠以及现实数据中长尾分布的挑战，受神经科学发现（想象与感知共享相似神经过程）启发，需要开发新方法来提升组合泛化能力

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，包含解构-重构框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，通过合成高保真组合特征来利用已见属性和对象的先验知识

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行大量实验，证明DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置中都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA方法有效解决了组合零样本学习中的关键挑战，通过特征增强和去偏策略显著提升了组合泛化能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门解决视觉-语言模型中视觉和语言处理不对称的问题，通过三种专家组实现模态特定处理和跨模态交互，在减少参数的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称挑战：视觉信息具有空间完整性，而语言需要保持序列上下文。深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础，过度依赖参数知识而非提供的多模态信息。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专家组：1) 模态内专家处理模态特定特征；2) 双曲跨模态专家进行分层跨模态交互；3) 证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏差并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验表明，AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别实现了26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型减少了25.45%的激活参数。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言处理的不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在减少计算成本的同时显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法捕捉长时程推理和记忆利用在部分可观测和动态变化下的挑战。

Method: 设计了两个动态空间基准测试，每个动作都会触发环境结构变化，需要持续更新认知和策略。提出了基于主观经验的记忆机制用于跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明该基准测试揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来方法学进展提供了一个全面的评估平台，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: SPGen是一种新颖的单视图3D生成方法，通过球面投影将3D几何信息编码为紧凑的多层2D表示，解决了现有方法的多视角不一致性问题，并能表示复杂内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视图3D生成模型依赖多视角扩散先验，容易产生视角不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂的内部结构和非平凡拓扑。

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面上，然后展开为紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影(SP)表示，完全在图像域操作，直接继承强大的2D扩散先验。

Result: 广泛实验表明，SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen通过球面投影表示成功解决了单视图3D生成中的视角一致性和复杂结构表示问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Motivation: 虽然现有的jailbreak攻击取得了显著进步，但其效果和效率仍有提升空间，但发现将弱防御机制整合到攻击中可以显著提升攻击效果和效率

Method: Defense2Attack方法包含三个核心组件：视觉优化器在对抗性干扰中嵌入积极语义；文本优化器使用防御风格提示精炼输入；红队后缀生成器通过强化学习微调增强jailbreak效果

Result: 在4个VLM模型和4个安全测试集上的实验结果显示，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中就能超过需要多次尝试的现有最佳攻击方法

Conclusion: 该研究为jailbreaking VLMs提供了新的视角，证明利用防御模式来指导攻击提示设计可以实现更高效的突破

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Motivation: 解决现有Gaussian Splatting方法中属性赋值无差别化导致的问题，包括双重监督导致的梯度冲突和表示效率低下的问题。

Method: 1）动态激活SH或法线的密化策略；2）根据梯度大小自适应调整每个高斯的SH阶数；3）使用任务解耦剪枝移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面都较现有最佳方法更优，以显著更少的参数数量实现了更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该高斯管理方案模型无关性，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时减少模型大小。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对多模态LLM如何利用与人类相关的图像质量属性进行评估缺乏深入理解

Method: 首先构建人类偏好数据集，分析图像质量属性间的相关性，然后为每个属性生成高控制度的合成数据集进行对比分析

Result: 人类能易判断所有图像质量属性，而LLM对某些属性如解剖准确性的判断能力较差，且属性间关联性较弱

Conclusion: 人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在显著差异，为改进自动化图像质量评估提供了见解

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

TL;DR: ReCOT是一个循环跨视角物体地理定位Transformer，将CVOGL任务重新定义为循环定位问题，通过可学习token和迭代注意力机制精确定位，结合SAM知识蒸馏和参考特征增强模块，在减少60%参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨视角物体地理定位方法将其视为一次性检测任务，直接回归物体位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误校正机制。

Method: 提出循环跨视角物体地理定位Transformer(ReCOT)，使用可学习token编码查询图像和提示嵌入的任务特定意图，通过迭代注意力机制精炼预测位置。引入SAM知识蒸馏策略传递分割先验知识，以及参考特征增强模块(RFEM)使用分层注意力强调物体相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中，ReCOT实现了最先进的性能，同时相比之前的SOTA方法减少了60%的参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和增强模块有效解决了跨视角物体地理定位中的噪声和错误校正问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

TL;DR: A-TDOM是一种基于实时3D高斯溅射优化的近实时数字正射影像图生成方法，能够克服传统离线流程的延迟问题，在秒级时间内处理新图像并保持可接受的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，导致延迟阻碍实时应用，且质量可能因相机位姿不准确、数字表面模型问题和场景遮挡而下降。

Method: 基于实时3D高斯溅射优化：每获取一张图像，通过实时SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯点集成优化到未重建区域，结合正交溅射技术实现即时渲染。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，A-TDOM能够在近实时条件下主动渲染TDOM，每个新图像的3DGS优化仅需秒级时间，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的实时性问题，通过实时3D高斯优化技术实现了高效、高质量的近实时数字正射影像图生成。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式token表示优化和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的挑战，为少样本分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但牺牲了超像素的规则性，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差。需要一种既能保持准确性又能保证规则性的超像素分割方法。

Method: 提出SPAM框架：训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，推理时利用大规模预训练的语义无关分割模型确保超像素与物体掩码对齐。可以处理任何先验高层分割，解决不确定区域，并支持交互式对象聚焦。

Conclusion: SPAM提供了一个多功能框架，能够生成准确且规则的超像素，解决了现有方法在准确性和规则性之间的权衡问题，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

Conclusion: SAGA通过选择性门控机制有效解决了线性注意力的低秩约束问题，实现了计算效率和模型性能的双重提升

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Result: 融合指标相比单一指标与主观质量评分具有更好的相关性，证明了融合方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过结合基于不同感知方法的指标，可以有效改进NeRF生成图像的质量评估，融合策略能够提供更准确的质量预测

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

TL;DR: 使用LLM生成犬类肌肉骨骼诊断的合成视觉训练数据，解决了数据稀缺问题，在真实数据上达到88% F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 某些任务数据收集困难（如罕见疾病或高成本），特别是在犬类肌肉骨骼状况视觉记录中，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 开发了将视觉记录映射到200多个标记区域的系统，使用引导解码、思维链推理和少样本提示等技术生成合成视觉文档

Result: 生成了1000个髌骨脱位诊断合成数据，对位置和严重程度敏感且与性别无关；生成的二元分类数据集在70个真实文档上达到88% F1分数

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据在解决罕见疾病数据稀缺方面具有巨大潜力，虽然方法针对医学领域，但可适应其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际部署中对象检测模型评估的挑战，因为真实标签缺乏且获取成本高

Method: 提出累积共识分数(CCS)，通过对每张图像进行测试时数据增帽，收集不同增帽视图下的预测框，使用IoU计算重叠度，并对最大重叠进行归一化和平均

Result: 在Open Images和KITTI数据集上，CCS与F1-score、概率检测质量和最优纠正成本达到超过90%的一致性，方法模型无关且支持单阶段和两阶段检测器

Conclusion: CCS为对象检测器提供了一种稳健的无监督评估方法，支持DevOps风格的监控和连续评估

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 类内多样性 - 原型有限表示能力无法覆盖类的全部变化；(2) 集合间不一致性 - 支持集原型与查询特征空间不对齐。

Method: 提出原型扩展网络(PENet)，采用双流学习器架构：固有学习器(IL)提取代表性特征，扩散学习器(DL)提供通用特征。通过原型同化模块(PAM)和原型校准机制(PCM)处理双原型。

Result: 在S3DIS和ScanNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，PENet在各种少样本设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 利用扩散模型的预训练条件编码器为原型扩展提供通用特征来源，PENet框架有效解决了少样本3D点云分割中的原型表示限制问题。

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Motivation: 现有的指令图像编辑方法在训练域外的指令上泛化能力不足，限制了实际应用。用户指令极其多样化，需要能够处理开放域指令的通用编辑系统。

Method: 1) 构建包含多样化模型和图像处理功能的模型级工具包；2) 采用三阶段渐进式强化学习方法，利用未标注的开放域指令反馈训练MLLM，使其具备通用推理能力。

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过结合MLLM的泛化能力和模型级工具包，成功解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

Conclusion: MEJO框架有效解决了手术三联体识别中的优化冲突问题，提升了识别性能

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a

models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然能准确定位图像中的关键对象，但对这些对象的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键对象可以提升模型的视觉能力

Method: 提出跨层视觉平滑(CLVS)方法，包含视觉记忆机制，在第一层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆，后续层中联合考虑先前层的视觉记忆，并通过不确定性指标确定何时终止平滑过程

Result: 在三个LVLM模型和四个基准测试上的实验证实了方法的有效性和泛化性，在多种视觉理解任务上达到最先进性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升

Conclusion: CLVS通过维持对关键对象的平滑注意力，有效提升了大型视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，特别是在复杂的关系和属性理解任务上表现突出

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖低层视觉特征（如纹理和对比度），难以捕捉图像中的高层语义信息。基于文本的语义引导方法缺乏结构化建模和空间定位能力，限制了细粒度融合性能。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合来自文本和视觉的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合模块同步优化高层语义和低层细节。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面表现突出，在下游任务（低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中展现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图引导的多模态融合方法，有效解决了红外与可见光图像融合中的语义信息捕获问题，为复杂环境下的多模态图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要关注空间线索而忽略时序依赖，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足；基于相关的孪生跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时序特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时序一致性并实现更丰富的特征表示。

Result: 相比基线方法，成功率提升13.7%，精确度提升14.7%；在Jetson Nano上实现7.1 FPS的实时运行，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 时序建模对孪生跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大而高效的解决方案，适合实际嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上，YOLOv8m模型参数从25.85M减至6.85M(减少73.51%)，FLOPs从49.6G减至13.3G，MACs从101G减至34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%。推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS，经TensorRT优化后达到68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在显著压缩模型的同时保持高检测精度，适用于高吞吐量、资源受限的边缘设备实时部署。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS是一个基于4D雷达增强的自监督3D重建框架，专门针对动态驾驶场景，通过雷达辅助的高斯初始化和速度引导的点跟踪模型，解决了动态物体重建不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督方法在动态物体重建方面存在困难，主要由于运动估计不精确和时间一致性弱，导致动态场景元素的重建不完整或失真。

Method: 提出4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态物体并恢复单目深度尺度；开发速度引导的点跟踪模型(VGPT)，在场景流监督下联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表示。

Result: 在OmniHD-Scenes数据集上评估，4DRadar-GS在动态驾驶场景3D重建方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中3D重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过对象级CLIP特征聚合策略，解决3D平滑散点在语义理解中的根本限制，实现了准确的开攻词汇对象检索和多任务适配


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D平滑散点技术在新视角合成中取得重大进展，但其内在的模糊性导致了语义理解困难，限制了在AR/VR和机器人学中的应用

Method: 利用预分解的对象级平滑分布，通过多视图CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的"嵌入包"，避免使用可微渲染方法

Result: 方法有效克服了3D开攻词汇对象提取的挑战，在2D开攻词汇分割上保持与最先进方法相当的性能

Conclusion: 该研究为3D平滑散点技术提供了一种范式转变的语义理解方案，通过对象级特征表征实现了更准确的开攻词汇对象检索和多任务适配能力

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Motivation: 解决事件相机数据有限和DVS输出稀疏导致的训练困难，以及现有方法忽视RGB与DVS模态间的分布差距问题

Method: 提出时间步混合知识转移(TMKT)策略，利用SNN的异步特性在不同时间步对RGB和DVS输入进行插值混合，并主动学习模态感知的辅助学习目标

Result: 方法能够实现更平滑的知识转移，缓解训练过程中的模态偏移，在耩米图像分类任务中获得优异性能，多个数据集实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TMKT通过细粒度的混合策略和模态感知学习目标，有效解决了跨模态知识转移中的分布差距问题，为事件相机与耩米神经网络的能源效率视觉处理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

Motivation: 解决同一图像中多个相互纷繁相邻的表面同时分割的挑战，提高交互分割的效率和准确性

Method: 设计网络架构接收RGB图像、多模态输入、错误面具和编码点击，在图像特征提取和多模态融合后集成交互信息，预测改进的分割面具

Result: 在DeLiVER数据集上平均每个表面减少1.28次点击，在MFNet上减少1.19次，RGB单模态基线在单面具分割中也表现竞争力

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略有效提升交互分割性能，新方法在复杂的多表面分割场景中表现优异

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过强调少样本学习，旨在促进开发适用于人文学者的鲁棒方法，减少人工标注需求，推动自动化文档分析工具在历史研究中的广泛应用

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SIREN网络在频谱支持与目标信号不匹配时出现的'频谱瓶颈'现象，即网络输出趋近于零且无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量

Method: WINNER方法：对均匀初始化的SIREN权重添加高斯噪声扰动，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需额外可训练参数

Result: 在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络训练提供了新的自适应、目标感知初始化策略方向

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务上显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%，其优势源于模型在预训练中对伪造相关概念的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专用AI生成图像检测器在精心策划的基准测试上表现优异，但在真实场景中失败率极高，需要寻找更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型（VFM）作为特征提取器，在其上构建简单的线性分类器，通过分析文本-图像相似性来探究模型对伪造相关概念的学习能力。

Result: 基于VFM的基线方法在真实场景检测准确率上比专用检测器提升超过20%，且发现近期VLM模型已学会将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐。

Conclusion: 现代VFM的原始"火力"比静态检测器的"工艺"更有效，真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史（包括预训练）。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的适配器设计和两阶段流程，有效解决了单图像3D虚拟人重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量的文本可控生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功解决了VLMs中感知和推理能力的联合提升问题，为视觉语言模型的强化学习训练提供了有效方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Result: HERO在多样化基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-准确性权衡，所有操作均在无需训练的情况下完成。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过准确估计图块级重要性并选择性保留具有互补作用的视觉token来优化性能。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Conclusion: TFANet通过三阶段分层对齐框架有效解决了指代图像分割中的多模态错位和语义损失问题，特别是在复杂多对象场景中表现出更好的分割准确性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用像素级损失函数，过度关注局部信息导致全局信息丢失，需要更有效的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出LLFDisc U形网络架构，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；改进基于VGG的感知损失，在深度特征上嵌入KL散度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LLFDisc在定性和定量评估方面均达到最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接拟合傅里叶域信息和改进的感知损失，能够更鲁棒地对齐傅里叶域信息，优于传统的MSE损失方法。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Conclusion: CMTSSL框架为轻量级高光谱图像应用提供了可以普遍推广的表征学习能力，特别适合卫星机轻部署。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为ResidualViT的视觉Transformer结构，通过学习性残差连接和令牌缩减模块，在保持准确性的同时大幅降低视频分析的计算成本，计算效率提升达到2.5倍，计算成本降低60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率的密集帧级特征计算，但这种计算成本极高，需要找到替代方案来降低计算复杂度。

Method: 设计了ResidualViT结构，包含：(1)学习性残差连接确保时间一致性；(2)令牌缩减模块选择性帝除时间冗余信息并重用预训练基础模型的权重。同时提出轻量级的获知策略来近似原始基础模型的帧级特征。

Conclusion: ResidualViT通过利用视频的时间冗余性，在保持高准确性的前提下，显著提高了视频分析的计算效率，为密集时间理解任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MSDNet通过多阶段蒸馏有效解决了4D雷达超分辨率中的精度-效率权衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了高效可靠的解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多视频协同框架，通过视频结构化模块和图融合模块，解决了单个视频时空不完整性导致的假想问题，显著提升了视频语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出了一个多视频协同框架：1）视频结构化模块：将视频知识表示为时空图；2）图融合模块：融合来自相关视频的结构化知识和有价值信息；3）构建精细的多视频结构化提示，将图、视觉和文本token结合作为输入。

Result: 大量实验证明了该框架的有效性，显示其在提升视频语言模型推理性能方面具有强大潜力。

Conclusion: 该多视频协同框架为解决视频语言模型的时空不完整性问题提供了一条有前晨的途径，通过结构化表示和多视频融合有效提升了模型的推理准确性。

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型自动提取医学形象报告中的诊断标签，构建大规模"银标准"数据集，通过监督预训练提升医学对比视觉-语言对齐性能，达到独立领域最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的出现为医学对比视觉-语言预训练带来了前所未有的机遇，需要一种更高效、更可扩展的方法来提升医学AI系统的性能。

Method: 利用LLMs自动从放射报告中提取诊断标签（准确率>96%），构建大规模低成本"银标准"数据集，然后进行监督预训练以提升对比视觉-语言对齐性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到独立领域最佳性能：CT-RATE上零样本诊断AUC 83.8%，RAD-ChestCT上77.3% AUC，跨模态检索性能显著提升（图像-图像MAP@50=53.7%，报告-图像Recall@100=52.2%）。

Conclusion: 这种方法证明了利用LLMs可以实现更高性能、更可扩展的医学AI系统，为医学对比学习预训练提供了一种高效但成本低廉的新途径。

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Motivation: 现有遗路障碍分割方法仅处理单帧图像，忽视了问题的时序性质，导致连续帧间预测不一致。

Method: 构建四个评测标准数据集，评测11种最新图像和视频分割方法，并提出两种基于视觉基础模型的基线方法。

Result: 在长序列视频中实现了最佳的遗路障碍视频分割性能。

Conclusion: 证明遗路障碍分割任务具有本质的时序性，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解和方向。

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Motivation: 解决公共监控中暴力检测面临的挑战，包括小尺度目标、复杂环境和实时时序分析需求，提升公共安全监控效果。

Method: 提出Vi-SAFE框架：1)使用GhostNetV3作为轻量化骨干网络优化YOLOv8；2)引入指数移动平均注意力机制和剪枝技术降低计算成本；3)YOLOv8和TSN分别训练，前者提取人体区域，后者进行暴力行为二分类。

Conclusion: Vi-SAFE框架有效解决了公共监控暴力检测的关键挑战，在保持精度的同时降低了计算成本，证明了其在公共安全监控中的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和修复方面表现出强大能力，但也存在被恶意使用的风险。现有方法难以检测基于扩散模型的修复生成图像，即使训练数据中包含类似修复图像

Method: End4方法设计去噪重建模型改善重建与检测过程的潜在空间对齐，利用尺度感知金字塔融合模块(SPFM)在不同尺度注意力金字塔层指导下细化局部图像特征

Result: 大量实验表明End4能有效泛化到未见过的掩码模式，并在各种扰动下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: End4方法在检测扩散模型修复生成图像方面表现出色，代码和数据集将很快发布

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一种无需训练的方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，使用Style Disentangled Attention模块实现细粒度的纹理和几何风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention模块，通过跨3D注意力机制建立内容图像和风格图像之间的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本的风格引导3D生成，提供了细粒度的风格控制能力，为3D内容创作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，在场景理解方面表现出色，即使在没有3D传感器输入或真实3D标注的野外视频中也适用

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ScaleDoc是一个高效处理大规模文档语义分析的系系，通过离线生成语义表示和在线轻量级代理模型过滤，显著减少LLM调用，实现2倍加速和85%的LLM调用减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工作负载涉及大量非结构化文档，需要语义理解而非传统基于值的谓词。虽然LLM具有强大的零样本能力，但其高推理成本导致不可接受的性能开销

Method: 1) 离线阶段使用LLM为每个文档生成语义表示；2) 在线阶段为每个查询训练轻量级代理模型过滤大部分文档，仅将模糊案例转发给LLM做最终决策；3) 基于对比学习的框架训练代理模型生成可靠预测分数；4) 自适应级联机制确定有效过滤策略

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，ScaleDoc实现超过2倍的端到端加速，减少高达85%的昂贵LLM调用

Conclusion: ScaleDoc使大规模语义分析变得实用且高效，通过创新的两阶段架构和优化技术解决了LLM高成本问题

Abstract: Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However,
modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands
semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given
enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to
unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel
system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline
representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline
phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations
for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model
on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only
the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,
\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant
efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy
model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade
mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific
accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that
\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces
expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis
practical and efficient.

TL;DR: IsoSched是首个支持抢占式多DNN调度的TSS架构框架，通过ILP规划、子图同构、负载均衡和优化算法，在延迟、吞吐量和能效方面优于现有LTS-PRM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Tile Spatial Scheduling (TSS) 方法缺乏对抢占的支持，而传统抢占方案基于Layer Temporal Scheduling (LTS) 存在高开销问题，无法满足新兴应用中关键任务的低延迟需求。

Method: 1) 将复杂拓扑图调度建模为整数线性规划和子图同构问题；2) 使用Layer Concatenate and Split (LCS) 进行瓦片流水线负载均衡；3) 采用Ullmann算法结合蒙特卡洛树搜索加速子图匹配，并使用CSR压缩矩阵编码减少内存使用。

Result: IsoSched在延迟约束吞吐量(LBT)、加速比和能效方面优于LTS-PRM方法(PREMA、Planaria等)，并在不同任务复杂度下比TSS-NPRM(HASP)实现更高的关键任务满足率。

Conclusion: IsoSched成功解决了TSS架构中抢占式调制的挑战，为复杂拓扑的多DNN并发执行提供了高效解决方案，特别适合自动驾驶等对延迟敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural network (DNN) accelerators with Layer Temporal
Scheduling (LTS) often incurs significant overheads (e.g., energy and latency),
as intermediate activations must be cached in DRAM. To alleviate this, Tile
Spatial Scheduling (TSS) reduces such costs by fragmenting inter-layer data
into smaller tiles communicated via on-chip links.However, many emerging
applications require concurrent execution of multiple DNNs with complex
topologies, where critical tasks must preempt others to meet stringent latency
requirements (e.g., in autonomous driving, obstacle detection must complete
within tens of milliseconds). Existing TSS works lack support for preemption,
while prior preemption schemes rely on LTS and thus inherit its overheads. This
highlights the need for preemptive and efficient TSS-based frameworks. Yet,
realizing such systems is challenging due to the complexity of enabling
preemption in graphs with large-scale topologies (e.g., modern large language
models may contain tens of thousands of edges). To tackle this, we present
IsoSched, the first framework enabling preemptive multi-DNN scheduling on TSS
architecture. IsoSched first formulates scheduling of complex-topology graphs
as an integer-linear program (ILP) and subgraph isomorphism problem; second, it
applies Layer Concatenate and Split (LCS) for load balancing in tile pipelines;
third, it employs an Ullmann-based algorithm enhanced by Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to accelerate subgraph matching, and uses compact matrix encoding
(i.e., Compressed Sparse Row, CSR) to reduce memory usage. IsoSched outperforms
LTS-PRM approaches (i.e., PREMA, Planaria, CD-MSA, MoCA) in Latency-Bound
Throughput (LBT), speedup, and energy efficiency, and achieves higher critical
task satisfaction than TSS-NPRM (i.e., HASP) across varying task complexities.

Abstract: Vector databases have rapidly grown in popularity, enabling efficient
similarity search over data such as text, images, and video. They now play a
central role in modern AI workflows, aiding large language models by grounding
model outputs in external literature through retrieval-augmented generation.
Despite their importance, little is known about the performance characteristics
of vector databases in high-performance computing (HPC) systems that drive
large-scale science. This work presents an empirical study of distributed
vector database performance on the Polaris supercomputer in the Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility. We construct a realistic biological-text
workload from BV-BRC and generate embeddings from the peS2o corpus using
Qwen3-Embedding-4B. We select Qdrant to evaluate insertion, index construction,
and query latency with up to 32 workers. Informed by practical lessons from our

performance on HPC platforms to guide future research and optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理时KV缓存访问的高内存和延迟开销是主要挑战，需要高效的部署方案

Method: 采用查询感知页面选择机制，利用边界框元数据估计注意力相关性，实现选择性KV加载；集成页面评分、稀疏内存访问和掩码注意力的融合CUDA内核

Result: 实验显示达到3.4倍加速和超过2倍内存节省，精度损失可忽略；缓存重用、页面命中率和多GPU扩展分析验证了实用性

Conclusion: TinyServe是资源受限硬件上LLM训练和推理研究的高效系统级设计方案

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently remains challenging due to
the high memory and latency overhead of key-value (KV) cache access during
autoregressive decoding. We present \textbf{TinyServe}, a lightweight and
extensible serving system for deploying tiny LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA, GPT2-345M)
with support for structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and
hardware-efficient attention kernels. Unlike prior simulation frameworks,
TinyServe executes real-time decoding with configurable sparsity strategies and
fine-grained instrumentation.
  To reduce decoding cost, we introduce a \textit{query-aware page selection}
mechanism that leverages bounding-box metadata to estimate attention relevance
between the query and KV cache blocks. This enables selective KV loading with
minimal overhead and no model modifications. Our fused CUDA kernel integrates
page scoring, sparse memory access, and masked attention in a single pass.
  Experiments show that TinyServe achieves up to \textbf{3.4x} speedup and over
\textbf{2x} memory savings with negligible accuracy drop. Additional analysis
of cache reuse, page hit rate, and multi-GPU scaling confirms its practicality
as an efficient system-level design for LLM training and inference research on
resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud computing and ultra-large-scale data
centers, the scale and complexity of systems have increased significantly,
leading to frequent faults that often show cascading propagation. How to
achieve efficient, accurate, and interpretable Root Cause Analysis (RCA) based
on observability data (metrics, logs, traces) has become a core issue in AIOps.
This paper reviews two mainstream research threads in top conferences and
journals over the past five years: FaultInsight[1] focusing on dynamic causal
discovery and HolisticRCA[2] focusing on multi-modal/cross-level fusion, and
analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods. A KylinRCA
framework integrating the ideas of both is proposed, which depicts the
propagation chain through temporal causal discovery, realizes global root cause
localization and type identification through cross-modal graph learning, and
outputs auditable evidence chains combined with mask-based explanation methods.
A multi-dimensional experimental scheme is designed, evaluation indicators are
clarified, and engineering challenges are discussed, providing an effective
solution for fault diagnosis under full-stack observability.

Motivation: HPC领域新CPU架构的向量化能力提升需要优化才能达到峰值性能，这对性能可移植性提出了挑战，需要评估代码、编译器和硬件之间的复杂交互。

Method: 选择分子对接应用作为案例研究，评估编译器自动向量化和显式向量化在现代长向量CPU上的性能表现，分析代码转换策略。

Result: 研究发现某些代码转换可以实现可移植的自动向量化，性能接近显式向量化。x86 CPU由于更宽的向量化单元通常比ARM CPU性能更高，但ARM架构在能耗和成本效益方面更具竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究为科学应用在HPC领域的未来发展提供了技术挑战、架构趋势和优化策略的重要见解，强调了性能与能效之间的权衡考量。

Abstract: Recent trends in the HPC field have introduced new CPU architectures with
improved vectorization capabilities that require optimization to achieve peak
performance and thus pose challenges for performance portability. The
deployment of high-performing scientific applications for CPUs requires
adapting the codebase and optimizing for performance. Evaluating these
applications provides insights into the complex interactions between code,
compilers, and hardware. We evaluate compiler auto-vectorization and explicit
vectorization to achieve performance portability across modern CPUs with long
vectors. We select a molecular docking application as a case study, as it
represents computational patterns commonly found across HPC workloads. We
report insights into the technical challenges, architectural trends, and
optimization strategies relevant to the future development of scientific
applications for HPC. Our results show which code transformations enable
portable auto-vectorization, reaching performance similar to explicit
vectorization. Experimental data confirms that x86 CPUs typically achieve
higher execution performance than ARM CPUs, primarily due to their wider
vectorization units. However, ARM architectures demonstrate competitive energy
consumption and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
has significantly heightened computational demands, particularly for
inference-serving workloads. While traditional cloud-based deployments offer
scalability, they face challenges such as network congestion, high energy
consumption, and privacy concerns. In contrast, edge computing provides
low-latency and sustainable alternatives but is constrained by limited
computational resources. In this work, we introduce SynergAI, a novel framework
designed for performance- and architecture-aware inference serving across
heterogeneous edge-to-cloud infrastructures. Built upon a comprehensive
performance characterization of modern inference engines, SynergAI integrates a
combination of offline and online decision-making policies to deliver
intelligent, lightweight, and architecture-aware scheduling. By dynamically
allocating workloads across diverse hardware architectures, it effectively
minimizes Quality of Service (QoS) violations. We implement SynergAI within a
Kubernetes-based ecosystem and evaluate its efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that architecture-driven inference serving enables optimized and
architecture-aware deployments on emerging hardware platforms, achieving an
average reduction of 2.4x in QoS violations compared to a State-of-the-Art
(SotA) solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用熵增度来描述计算机组件间的不兼容性所导致的噪声和混乱现象，通过数学化方法来分析并行集群的系统熵增度。

Method: 基于图论和对数的数学理论模型，考虑集群中每个系统的熵增度，建立了并行集群熵增度的量化方法。

Result: 在Top500超级计算机前10名中进行了熵增度计算，发现系统熵增度与计算性能存在显著负相关关系，特别是LINPACK测试显示强负相关(r = -0.7832, p = 0.0077)，低熵增度系统具有更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该熵增度框架不仅适用于传统的密集线性代数工作负载，还在MLPerf混合精度测试和HPCC综合分数中显示了中等负相关，证明了该框架的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Ever since Claude Shannon used entropy for his "Mathematical Theory of
Communication", entropy has become a buzzword in research circles with
scientists applying entropy to describe any phenomena that are reminiscent of
disorder. In this paper, we used entropy to describe the incompatibility
between components in the computer, which can cause noise and disorder within
the parallel cluster. We develop a mathematical theory, primarily based on
graph theory and logarithms, to quantify the entropy of a parallel cluster by
accounting for the entropy of each system within the cluster. We proceed using
this model to calculate the entropy of the Top 10 supercomputers in the Top500
list. Our entropy framework reveals a statistically significant negative
correlation between system entropy and computational performance across the
world's fastest supercomputers. Most notably, the LINPACK benchmark
demonstrates a strong negative correlation (r = -0.7832, p = 0.0077) with our
entropy measure, indicating that systems with lower entropy consistently
achieve higher computational efficiency, this Relationship is further supported
by moderate correlations with MLPerf mixed-precision benchmarks (r = -0.6234)
and HPCC composite scores (r = -0.5890), suggesting the framework's
applicability extends beyond traditional dense linear algebra workloads.

Abstract: The strategic importance of artificial intelligence is driving a global push
toward Sovereign AI initiatives. Nationwide governments are increasingly
developing dedicated infrastructures, called AI Factories (AIF), to achieve
technological autonomy and secure the resources necessary to sustain robust
local digital ecosystems.
  In Europe, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking is investing hundreds of millions of
euros into several AI Factories, built atop existing high-performance computing
(HPC) supercomputers. However, while HPC systems excel in raw performance, they
are not inherently designed for usability, accessibility, or serving as
public-facing platforms for AI services such as inference or agentic
applications. In contrast, AI practitioners are accustomed to cloud-native
technologies like Kubernetes and object storage, tools that are often difficult
to integrate within traditional HPC environments.
  This article advocates for a dual-stack approach within supercomputers:
integrating both HPC and cloud-native technologies. Our goal is to bridge the
divide between HPC and cloud computing by combining high performance and
hardware acceleration with ease of use and service-oriented front-ends. This
convergence allows each paradigm to amplify the other. To this end, we will
study the cloud challenges of HPC (Serverless HPC) and the HPC challenges of
cloud technologies (High-performance Cloud).

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了无线多模态联邦学习中的模态异质性问题，在延迟、能消和带宽约束下显著提升了学习性能。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning (MFL) is a distributed framework for training
multimodal models without uploading local multimodal data of clients, thereby
effectively protecting client privacy. However, multimodal data is commonly
heterogeneous across diverse clients, where each client possesses only a subset
of all modalities, renders conventional analysis results and optimization
methods in unimodal federated learning inapplicable. In addition, fixed latency
demand and limited communication bandwidth pose significant challenges for
deploying MFL in wireless scenarios. To optimize the wireless MFL performance
on modal heterogeneity, this paper proposes a joint client scheduling and
bandwidth allocation (JCSBA) algorithm based on a decision-level fusion
architecture with adding a unimodal loss function. Specifically, with the
decision results, the unimodal loss functions are added to both the training
objective and local update loss functions to accelerate multimodal convergence
and improve unimodal performance. To characterize MFL performance, we derive a
closed-form upper bound related to client and modality scheduling and minimize
the derived bound under the latency, energy, and bandwidth constraints through
JCSBA. Experimental results on multimodal datasets demonstrate that the JCSBA
algorithm improves the multimodal accuracy and the unimodal accuracy by 4.06%
and 2.73%, respectively, compared to conventional algorithms.

Result: 打破了循环依赖问题，使得进程能够在没有初始协调的情况下独立选择兼容的故障假设

Conclusion: 非对称网格仲裁系统为分布式系统提供了灵活的异构信任模型，在云平台和区块链网络等场景中具有广泛应用价值

Abstract: Quorum systems are a common way to formalize failure assumptions in
distributed systems. Traditionally, these assumptions are shared by all
involved processes. More recently, systems have emerged which allow processes
some freedom in choosing their own, subjective or asymmetric, failure
assumptions. For such a system to work, individual processes' assumptions must
be compatible. However, this leads to a Catch-22-style scenario: How can
processes collaborate to agree on compatible failure assumptions when they have
no compatible failure assumptions to start with?
  We introduce asymmetric grid quorum systems that allow a group of processes
to specify heterogeneous trust assumptions independently of each other and
without coordination. They are based on qualitative attributes describing how
the processes differ. Each process may select a quorum system from this class
that aligns best with its subjective view. The available choices are designed
to be compatible by definition, thereby breaking the cycling dependency.
Asymmetric grid quorum systems have many applications that range from cloud
platforms to blockchain networks.

Conclusion: 论文确定了有界容量共享内存模型中模拟无界全信息协议的轮次复杂度下界，并提出了进行优化的算法。这些结果适用于多种迭代共享内存模型，包括常规读写寄存器和原子快照。

Abstract: The celebrated asynchronous computability theorem (ACT) characterizes tasks
solvable in the read-write shared-memory model using the unbounded
full-information protocol, where in every round of computation, each process
shares its complete knowledge of the system with the other processes.
Therefore, ACT assumes shared-memory variables of unbounded capacity. It has
been recently shown that boundedvariables can achieve the same computational
power at the expense of extra rounds. However, the exact relationship between
the bit capacity of the shared memory and the number of rounds required in
order to implement one round of the full-information protocol remained unknown.
  In this paper, we focus on the asymptotic round complexity of bounded
iterated shared-memory algorithms that simulate, up to isomorphism, the
unbounded full-information protocol. We relate the round complexity to the
number of processes $n$, the number of iterations of the full information
protocol $r$, and the bit size per shared-memory entry $b$. By analyzing the
corresponding protocol complex, a combinatorial structure representing
reachable states, we derive necessary conditions and present a bounded
full-information algorithm tailored to the bits available $b$ per shared memory
entry. We show that for $n>2$, the round complexity required to implement the
full-information protocol satisfies $\Omega((n!)^{r-1} \cdot 2^{n-b})$. Our
results apply to a range of iterated shared-memory models, from regular
read-write registers to atomic and immediate snapshots. Moreover, our bounded
full-information algorithm is asymptotically optimal for the iterated collect
model and within a linear factor $n$ of optimal for the snapshot-based models.

Motivation: 解决LLM应用对计算资源需求巨大、静态资源分配导致的长时间排队等待和硬件成本高的问题，利用非延迟敏感应用的特性进行机会资源池化

Method: 提出普遍上下文管理方法，利用LLM应用中共享的计算上下文，通过机制和策略实现在机会资源上的无缝上下文重用

Result: 在机会资源上运行的LLM应用执行时间减少98.1%

Conclusion: 普遍上下文管理能够有效利用机会资源，显著提升LLM应用性能，为解决计算资源供需矛盾提供了可行方案

Abstract: The widespread growth in LLM developments increasingly demands more
computational power from clusters than what they can supply. Traditional LLM
applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force
users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy
expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply
problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can
instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation
allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources
over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases.
Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges
nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common
computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies
that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation
shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic
resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.

Abstract: This letter addresses a critical challenge in the context of 6G and beyond
wireless networks, the joint optimization of power and bandwidth resource
allocation for aerial intelligent platforms, specifically uncrewed aerial
vehicles (UAVs), operating in highly dynamic environments with mobile ground
user equipment (UEs). We introduce FLARE (Flying Learning Agents for Resource
Efficiency), a learning-enabled aerial intelligence framework that jointly
optimizes UAV positioning, altitude, transmit power, and bandwidth allocation
in real-time. To adapt to UE mobility, we employ Silhouette-based K-Means
clustering, enabling dynamic grouping of users and UAVs' deployment at cluster
centroids for efficient service delivery. The problem is modeled as a
multi-agent control task, with bandwidth discretized into resource blocks and
power treated as a continuous variable. To solve this, our proposed framework,
FLARE, employs a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy that combines
Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Deep Q-Network
(DQN) to enhance learning efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances user coverage, achieving a 73.45% improvement in
the number of served users under a 5 Mbps data rate constraint, outperforming
MADDPG baseline.

Abstract: Network planning seeks to determine base station parameters that maximize
coverage and capacity in cellular networks. However, achieving optimal planning
remains challenging due to the diversity of deployment scenarios and the
significant simulation-to-reality discrepancy. In this paper, we propose
\emph{AutoPlan}, a new automatic network planning framework by leveraging
digital radio twin (DRT) techniques. We derive the DRT by finetuning the
parameters of building materials to reduce the sim-to-real discrepancy based on
crowdsource real-world user data. Leveraging the DRT, we design a Bayesian
optimization based algorithm to optimize the deployment parameters of base
stations efficiently. Using the field measurement from Husker-Net, we
extensively evaluate \emph{AutoPlan} under various deployment scenarios, in
terms of both coverage and capacity. The evaluation results show that
\emph{AutoPlan} flexibly adapts to different scenarios and achieves performance
comparable to exhaustive search, while requiring less than 2\% of its
computation time.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了激光波IAB网络的弹性和可靠性，为动态城市环境中的网络部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology enables real-time monitoring and optimization of
complex network infrastructures by creating accurate virtual replicas of
physical systems. In millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G/6G networks, the deployment of
Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) nodes faces highly dynamic urban
environments, necessitating intelligent DT-enabled optimization frameworks.
Traditional IAB deployment optimization approaches struggle with the
combinatorial complexity of jointly optimizing coverage, connectivity, and
resilience, often leading to suboptimal solutions that are vulnerable to
network disruptions. With this consideration, we propose a novel Graph
Attention Network v2 (GATv2)-based reinforcement learning approach for
resilient IAB deployment in urban mmWave networks. Specifically, we formulate
the deployment problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with explicit
resilience constraints and employ edge-conditioned GATv2 to capture complex
spatial dependencies between heterogeneous node types and dynamic connectivity
patterns. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on critical
deployment locations to maximize coverage and ensure fault tolerance through
redundant backhaul connections. To address the inherent vulnerability of mmWave
links, we train the GATv2 policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
a carefully designed balance between coverage, cost, and resilience.
Comprehensive simulations across three urban scenarios demonstrate that our
method achieves 98.5-98.7 percent coverage with 14.3-26.7 percent fewer nodes
than baseline approaches, while maintaining 87.1 percent coverage retention
under 30 percent link failures, representing 11.3-15.4 percent improvement in

TL;DR: 结合强化学习与优化理论的统一框架，用于解决无线网络中的0-1混合优化问题，在大规模场景下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模无线网络中的0-1混合优化问题面临挑战，包括网络规模大、多维资源分配咍多样化服务需求，传统优化方法咍强化学习算法在这些场景下效果有限

Method: 使用RL捕捉二进制变量的序列决策过程，在决策步骤中放松二进制变量并求解放松问题获得优化信息指导RL搜索策略，最后根据决策结果更新搜索策略

Result: 在小规模问题中比B&B算法减少30%的收敛时间，目标值略高；在大规模场景下比RL算法提高20%的标准化目标值，且收敛时间更短

Conclusion: 该统一框架通过结合RL咍优化理论，有效解决了无线网络中的0-1混合优化问题，在各种规模场景下都显示出优异的性能，并且具有理论性能边界咍收敛性保证

Abstract: Several wireless networking problems are often posed as 0-1 mixed
optimization problems, which involve binary variables (e.g., selection of
access points, channels, and tasks) and continuous variables (e.g., allocation
of bandwidth, power, and computing resources). Traditional optimization methods
as well as reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely exploited to
solve these problems under different network scenarios. However, solving such
problems becomes more challenging when dealing with a large network scale,
multi-dimensional radio resources, and diversified service requirements. To
this end, in this paper, a unified framework that combines RL and optimization
theory is proposed to solve 0-1 mixed optimization problems in wireless
networks. First, RL is used to capture the process of solving binary variables
as a sequential decision-making task. During the decision-making steps, the
binary (0-1) variables are relaxed and, then, a relaxed problem is solved to
obtain a relaxed solution, which serves as prior information to guide RL
searching policy. Then, at the end of decision-making process, the search
policy is updated via suboptimal objective value based on decisions made. The
performance bound and convergence guarantees of the proposed framework are then
proven theoretically. An extension of this approach is provided to solve
problems with a non-convex objective function and/or non-convex constraints.
Numerical results show that the proposed approach reduces the convergence time
by about 30% over B&B in small-scale problems with slightly higher objective
values. In large-scale scenarios, it can improve the normalized objective
values by 20% over RL with a shorter convergence time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地面网络在遥远地区和紧急情况下的通信挑战，低轨道卫星虽有全球覆盖但存在覆盖间断和通信窗口有限的问题。

Method: 提出三层设计：卫星-HAP采用混合光学链路，HAP-地面采用无线电链路。形成聚合优化问题，并提出基于变换器编码器和激洞模型的DD3QN-AS深度强化学习算法来解决。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该方法在信息年龄优化和系统性能方面表现优于其他策略基方法和深度强化学习基准。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的SAGIN架构解决方案，通过智能中继系统和先进算法，成功解决了低轨卫星网络的间断性问题，为遥远地区和紧急通信提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Despite the widespread deployment of terrestrial networks, providing reliable
communication services to remote areas and maintaining connectivity during
emergencies remains challenging. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced
latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication
windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information
(AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that
leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO
satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid
free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication
and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and
thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while
serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint
optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover
frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection
decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled
constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional
approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model
(DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state
transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based
temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative
module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising.
Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach
compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) benchmarks.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) enable smarter, self-optimizing mobile networks, but they
rely on a steady supply of real world data. Collecting and transferring
complete traces in real time is a significant challenge. We present a compact
traffic generator that combines hidden Markov model, capturing the broad
rhythms of buffering, streaming and idle periods, with a small feed forward
mixture density network that generates realistic payload sizes and
inter-arrival times to be fed to the DT. This traffic generator trains in
seconds on a server GPU, runs in real time and can be fine tuned inside the DT
whenever the statistics of the generated data do not match the actual traffic.
This enables operators to keep their DT up to date without causing overhead to
the operational network. The results show that the traffic generator presented
is able to derive realistic packet traces of payload length and inter-arrival
time across various metrics that assess distributional fidelity, diversity, and
temporal correlation of the synthetic trace.

Method: 分析了规范在不同社区中的角色，展示了几个成功案例，并提出渗透洞差的可行策略

Result: 识别了网络社区和形式方法社区在理解形式规范方面的关键差异，为推广形式方法提供了见解

Conclusion: 形式规范对网络协议设计有重要价值，需要找到有效方法渗透不同社区间的理解洞差，以促进形式方法的更广泛应用

Abstract: Formal specifications have numerous benefits for both designers and users of
network protocols. They provide clear, unambiguous representations, which are
useful as documentation and for testing. They can help reveal disagreements
about what a protocol "is" and identify areas where further work is needed to
resolve ambiguities or internal inconsistencies. They also provide a foundation
for formal reasoning, making it possible to establish important security and
correctness guarantees on all inputs and in every environment. Despite these
advantages, formal methods are not widely used to design, implement, and
validate network protocols today. Instead, Internet protocols are usually
described in informal documents, such as IETF Requests for Comments (RFCs) or
IEEE standards. These documents primarily consist of lengthy prose
descriptions, accompanied by pseudocode, header descriptions, state machine
diagrams, and reference implementations which are used for interoperability
testing. So, while RFCs and reference implementations were only intended to
help guide the social process used by protocol designers, they have evolved
into the closest things to formal specifications the Internet community has. In
this paper, we discuss the different roles that specifications play in the
networking and formal methods communities. We then illustrate the potential
benefits of specifying protocols formally, presenting highlights from several
recent success stories. Finally, we identify key differences between how formal
specifications are understood by the two communities and suggest possible
strategies to bridge the gaps.

Method: 构建符合IEC 61131-3标准的SFC和LD程序文本表示对数据集，对LLM进行细调训练

Result: 细调后的LLM模型在某些数据集上达到91%准确率，最低也有79%

Conclusion: 通过适当的训练和表示方式，LLM可以有效支持LD-SFC转换，该方法具有可行性和潜力

Abstract: In the domain of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming, converting
a Ladder Diagram (LD) into a Sequential Function Chart (SFC) is an inherently
challenging problem, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge and
the issue of state explosion in existing algorithms. However, the rapid
development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) - especially Large Language Model
(LLM) - offers a promising new approach.
  Despite this potential, data-driven approaches in this field have been
hindered by a lack of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we constructed
several datasets consisting of paired textual representations of SFC and LD
programs that conform to the IEC 61131-3 standard.
  Based on these datasets, we explored the feasibility of automating the LD-SFC
conversion using LLM. Our preliminary experiments show that a fine-tuned LLM
model achieves up to 91% accuracy on certain dataset, with the lowest observed
accuracy being 79%, suggesting that with proper training and representation,
LLMs can effectively support LD-SFC conversion. These early results highlight
the viability and future potential of this approach.

Conclusion: 该方法能够系统地生成紧凑的线性规划问题规模，有效解决了算法编译产生的大规模LP问题，为处理拓展复杂度指数增长的问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear Programming (LP) is widely applied in industry and is a key component
of various other mathematical problem-solving techniques. Recent work
introduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space
algorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming
languages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of
constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting
LPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for
existing LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating
substantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish
minimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural
formulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to
enable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP)
formulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time
separation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining
technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions
with well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time
parameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and
variables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss
of generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size
$n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems
-- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the
weighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size
natural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and
substantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and
non-commercial LP solvers.

Method: 在Gallina函数式语言中创建浅层嵌入的命令式语言GallinaC，包含真正通用且无界的while循环。利用函数式核心使得程序证明可以使用与纯函数式程序相同的策略

Result: 原型实现已证明GallinaC的可行性，成功完成了未知大小链表反转程序的正确性证明。目前正专注于GallinaC中间表示与CompCert后端入口语言Cminor的前向模拟

Conclusion: GallinaC为底层系统软件提供了一种在证明助手中开发机器验证正确性证明的有效方法，结合了命令式编程的实用性和函数式证明的严谨性

Abstract: Even with the increase of popularity of functional programming, imperative
programming remains a key programming paradigm, especially for programs
operating at lower levels of abstraction. When such software offers key
components of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), e.g. an operating system kernel,
it becomes desirable to provide mathematical correctness proofs.
  However, current real-world imperative programming languages possess
"expressive", i.e. overly permissive, semantics. Thus, producing correctness
proofs of such programs becomes tedious and error-prone, requiring to take care
of numerous "administrative" details. Ideally, a proof-oriented imperative
language should feature well-behaved semantics while allowing imperative
idioms.
  To obtain a high-degree of confidence in the correctness of such a language,
its tools should be developed inside a proof-assistant such that program proofs
are machine checked.
  We present GallinaC, a shallow embedding of a Turing-complete imperative
language directly inside the functional programming language of the Rocq proof
assistant, Gallina. In particular, it features a truly generic and unbounded
while loop. Having a functional core means proofs about GallinaC programs may
use the same tactics as proofs about pure functional ones.
  Work on GallinaC is still under progress, but we present first promising
results. A prototype implementation has shown the viability of GallinaC with
the correctness proof of a list reversal procedure for linked-lists of unknown
size. We currently focus on the forward simulation between the GallinaC
intermediate representation (IR) and Cminor, the entry language of the CompCert
back-end.

Abstract: We introduce the Rebound library that supports well-scoped term
representations in Haskell and automates the definition of substitution,
alpha-equivalence, and other operations that work with binding structures. The
key idea of our design is the use of first-class environments that map
variables to expressions in some new scope. By statically tracking scopes,
users of this library gain confidence that they have correctly maintained the
subtle invariants that stem from using de Bruijn indices. Behind the scenes,
Rebound uses environments to optimize the application of substitutions, while
providing explicit access to these data structures when desired. We demonstrate
that this library is expressive by using it to implement a wide range of
language features with sophisticated uses of binding and several different
operations that use this abstract syntax. Our examples include pi-forall, a
tutorial implementation of a type checker for a dependently-typed programming
language. Finally, we benchmark Rebound to understand its performance
characteristics and find that it produces faster code than competing libraries.

Abstract: Large language models have shown impressive performance in various domains,
including code generation across diverse open-source domains. However, their
applicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific
constraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely
unexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the
leveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in
generating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized
software environment.
  We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase
and introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation
metric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and
integrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various
prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific
LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,
using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that
prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output
quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest
build success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific
LLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across
different model families.

Conclusion: 证明了代理智能在Fortran到Kokkos转换中的可行性，为自主现代化绣承科学应用提供了途径，显示了LLM驱动的代理系统在科学计算领域的潜力

Abstract: Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases
originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance
Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many
accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize
legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance
portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos
porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully
autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains
largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse
hardware.
  This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents"
collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize
Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline
modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos
codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and
o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating
optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models
like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes.
  This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos
transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy
scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse
supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic
systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific
and systems-oriented applications.

Motivation: 可持续软件工程(SSE)缺乏针对特定组织背景（如金融服务行业）的研究，这些行业具有数据驱动、严格监管和高交易量等特点，需要理解其具体的可持续性需求。

Method: 采用探索性定性案例研究，通过对金融服务公司的高层管理人员（6人）和软件工程师（16人）进行访谈和焦点小组讨论，调查他们对可持续性的认知、实践方式和挑战。

Result: 研究发现组织层级间对可持续性的理解存在明显分歧：管理层强调技术经济可持续性（云迁移、业务连续性），开发者关注人力因素（工作量管理、压力减少），且对组织倡议持怀疑态度。

Conclusion: 组织目标与开发者需求之间的脱节凸显了需要针对具体情境、共同设计的干预措施的重要性，许多参与者倾向于建立专门的可持续性团队。

Abstract: Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE) is slowly becoming an industry need
for reasons including reputation enhancement, improved profits and more
efficient practices. However, SSE has many definitions, and this is a challenge
for organisations trying to build a common and broadly agreed understanding of
the term. Although much research effort has gone into identifying general SSE
practices, there is a gap in understanding the sustainability needs of specific
organisational contexts, such as financial services, which are highly
data-driven, operate under strict regulatory requirements, and handle millions
of transactions day to day. To address this gap, our research focuses on a
financial services company (FinServCo) that invited us to investigate
perceptions of sustainability in their IT function: how it could be put into
practice, who is responsible for it, and what the challenges are. We conducted
an exploratory qualitative case study using interviews and a focus group with
six higher management employees and 16 software engineers comprising various
experience levels from junior developers to team leaders. Our study found a
clear divergence in how sustainability is perceived between organisational
levels. Higher management emphasised technical and economic sustainability,
focusing on cloud migration and business continuity through data availability.
In contrast, developers highlighted human-centric concerns such as workload
management and stress reduction. Scepticism toward organisational initiatives
was also evident, with some developers viewing them as a PR strategy. Many
participants expressed a preference for a dedicated sustainability team,
drawing analogies to internal structures for security governance. The
disconnect between organisational goals and individual developer needs
highlights the importance of context-sensitive, co-designed interventions.

TL;DR: 首个系统性定性研究vibe coding实践，通过19万字数据分析描述了开发者的感知、使用原因、困难和最佳实践


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然初期研究已开始探索vibe coding范式，但大多数研究仅分析代码或提出缺乏实证支撑的理论，需要对开发者实际体验和感知进行基础性理解

Method: 采用定性研究方法，分析来自半结构化记录、Reddit讨论和LinkedIn帖子的超过19万字数据，对vibe coding进行系统性探索

Result: 提出了以AI对话交互、共同创造和开发者心流为核心的vibe coding理论，发现AI信任调节从委托到共创的连续过程，持续心流支持开发者体验，也识别了规范化、可靠性、调试等领域的痛点和风险

Conclusion: 研究为AI开发工具的未来发展提供了含义，并指明了进一步研究vibe coding的方向

Abstract: Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly
become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in
AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI
assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront
specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most
focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical
backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it
is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic
qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on
over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and
LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use
it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We
propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on
conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We
find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to
co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We
surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification,
reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also
present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these
challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and
directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.

*Zhihong Sun,Jia Li,Yao Wan,Chuanyi Li,Hongyu Zhang,Zhi jin,Ge Li,Hong Liu,Chen Lyu,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究探索集成学习提升大语言模型在代码漏洞检测中的性能，提出动态门控堆叠(DGS)方法，在三个数据集上验证了集成策略的有效性，特别是Boosting在不平衡数据集和DGS在多分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在代码漏洞检测中展现出潜力，但不同模型或同一模型不同训练阶段对相同代码片段的检测结果存在显著不一致性，这种不一致性既影响检测稳定性，也揭示了模型间潜在的互补性，可以通过集成学习构建更鲁棒的漏洞检测系统。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型(DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B、CodeLlama-7B、CodeLlama-13B、CodeQwen1.5-7B、StarCoder2-15B)，采用三种集成策略(Bagging、Boosting、Stacking)，在三个数据集(Devign、ReVeal、BigVul)上进行实验，并受混合专家(MoE)技术启发提出动态门控堆叠(DGS)方法。

Result: 集成方法显著提升检测性能，Boosting在不平衡数据集场景中表现优异，DGS持续优于传统Stacking，特别是在处理类别不平衡和多分类任务方面。

Conclusion: 通过集成学习可以构建更可靠有效的大语言模型漏洞检测系统，DGS方法为处理复杂检测任务提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Code vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and
reliability of modern software systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promising capabilities in this domain. However, notable
discrepancies in detection results often arise when analyzing identical code
segments across different training stages of the same model or among
architecturally distinct LLMs. While such inconsistencies may compromise
detection stability, they also highlight a key opportunity: the latent
complementarity among models can be harnessed through ensemble learning to
create more robust vulnerability detection systems. In this study, we explore
the potential of ensemble learning to enhance the performance of LLMs in source
code vulnerability detection. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving
five LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B,
CodeQwen1.5-7B, and StarCoder2-15B), using three ensemble strategies (i.e.,
Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking). These experiments are carried out across
three widely adopted datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul). Inspired by
Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques, we further propose Dynamic Gated Stacking
(DGS), a Stacking variant tailored for vulnerability detection. Our results
demonstrate that ensemble approaches can significantly improve detection
performance, with Boosting excelling in scenarios involving imbalanced
datasets. Moreover, DGS consistently outperforms traditional Stacking,
particularly in handling class imbalance and multi-class classification tasks.
These findings offer valuable insights into building more reliable and
effective LLM-based vulnerability detection systems through ensemble learning.

Motivation: 研究UAV与LLM融合的学术研究与实际应用之间的差距，避免研究成果与实用需求脱节。

Method: 实证研究：分析74篇论文和56个GitHub项目，识别9种任务类型并量化分布；发放在线问卷获得52份有效回复。

Result: 学术界侧重理论建模和任务优化，工业界关注飞行控制、任务规划和人机交互；40.4%的从业者尝试过将LLM应用于UAV任务。

Conclusion: 识别了技术成熟度、性能、安全、成本等阻碍因素，为未来发展提供了挑战和建议。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and large language models
(LLMs) has emerged as a research direction of growing interest, with the
potential to address challenges in autonomous decision-making, human-UAV
interaction, and real-time adaptability. However, existing studies have
remained largely in preliminary exploration with a limited understanding of
real-world practice, risking a misalignment between academic research and
practical needs and hindering the translation of results. To examine and
address these potential challenges, we conducted an empirical study of 74
selected papers and 56 public GitHub projects, identified nine task types for
LLMs in UAV systems, and quantified their distribution. Our findings show that
academic research emphasizes theoretical modeling and task optimization with
dispersed attention across tasks. In contrast, industrial projects focus on
flight control, task planning, and human-machine interaction, prioritizing
operability and efficiency. To further capture industry perspectives, we
distributed an online questionnaire. We obtained 52 valid responses: 40.4% of
practitioners have attempted to apply LLMs to UAV tasks. We further identify
factors that impede real-world integration, including technological maturity,
performance, safety, cost, and other considerations. Finally, we highlight
challenges for future development and provide recommendations.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型在提高汽车系统灵活性方面的应用潜力，通过三个案例研究展示了LLMs在自动化更新、硬件抽象、合规性检查、接口兼容性验证和架构修改建议等方面的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车系统存在诸多瓶颈导致灵活性降低，长期维护和后期更新扩展困难，主要由于冗长的重新工程、标准化和合规流程，以及设备和软件组件的异构性和数量庞大。

Method: 使用OpenAI的GPT-4o模型进行概念验证实现，通过三个案例研究：1）更新、硬件抽象和合规性；2）接口兼容性检查；3）架构修改建议。

Result: 早期研究表明LLMs在自动化汽车系统任务和流程方面具有潜力，能够提高系统灵活性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在汽车系统自动化方面展现出良好的应用前景，特别是在解决系统灵活性和维护难题方面，为未来研究提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: There are many bottlenecks that decrease the flexibility of automotive
systems, making their long-term maintenance, as well as updates and extensions
in later lifecycle phases increasingly difficult, mainly due to long
re-engineering, standardization, and compliance procedures, as well as
heterogeneity and numerosity of devices and underlying software components
involved. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to
increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards
achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1)
updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility
checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept
implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

TL;DR: SateLight是一个专为卫星计算设计的应用更新框架，通过容器化、差分更新和容错机制解决卫星应用更新的挑战，显著减少传输延迟并确保100%更新正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星计算需要应用软件更新，但现有地面系统更新方法无法应对卫星环境的异构性、有限带宽和恶劣空间条件等约束。

Method: SateLight框架采用容器化封装异构应用，集成三种能力：内容感知差分策略减少通信数据量、细粒度星上更新设计重构目标应用、基于层的容错恢复机制确保可靠性。

Result: 在10个代表性卫星应用的卫星模拟环境中，SateLight相比最佳基线传输延迟降低最高91.18%（平均56.54%），所有应用更新正确率达到100%。真实在轨卫星案例研究验证了实用性。

Conclusion: SateLight是一个实用有效的卫星应用更新框架，成功解决了卫星计算环境下的应用更新挑战，为卫星计算系统提供了可靠的软件维护解决方案。

Abstract: Satellite computing is an emerging paradigm that empowers satellites to
perform onboard processing tasks (i.e., \textit{satellite applications}),
thereby reducing reliance on ground-based systems and improving responsiveness.
However, enabling application software updates in this context remains a
fundamental challenge due to application heterogeneity, limited
ground-to-satellite bandwidth, and harsh space conditions. Existing software
update approaches, designed primarily for terrestrial systems, fail to address
these constraints, as they assume abundant computational capacity and stable
connectivity.
  To address this gap, we propose SateLight, a practical and effective
satellite application update framework tailored for satellite computing.
SateLight leverages containerization to encapsulate heterogeneous applications,
enabling efficient deployment and maintenance. SateLight further integrates
three capabilities: (1) a content-aware differential strategy that minimizes
communication data volume, (2) a fine-grained onboard update design that
reconstructs target applications, and (3) a layer-based fault-tolerant recovery
mechanism to ensure reliability under failure-prone space conditions.
Experimental results on a satellite simulation environment with 10
representative satellite applications demonstrate that SateLight reduces
transmission latency by up to 91.18% (average 56.54%) compared to the best
currently available baseline. It also consistently ensures 100% update
correctness across all evaluated applications. Furthermore, a case study on a
real-world in-orbit satellite demonstrates the practicality of our approach.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated source-code
translation, a capability critical to software migration, maintenance, and
interoperability. Yet comparative evidence on how model choice, prompt design,
and prompt language shape translation quality across multiple programming
languages remains limited. This study conducts a systematic empirical
assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java,
Python, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and
CodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two
prompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt
languages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language
pairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across
models and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by
13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging
pairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM
outperforms TransCoder across the benchmark. These results demonstrate the
value of careful prompt engineering and prompt language choice, and provide
practical guidance for software modernization and cross-language
interoperability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的智能合约漏洞检测流水线，结合了静态分析工具、大语言模型、符号执行和具体执行技术，以提高检测准确性和减少假正报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态分析工具和大语言模型在漏洞检测中高假正报率问题，需要能够形式或经验证明缺陷存在的方法。

Method: 集成自定义Slither检测器、LLMs、Kontrol和Forge工具，通过符号执行和具体执行技术来可靠检测缺陷并生成证明。

Result: 在7种关键缺陷类型上获得了有前景的实验结果，特别在重入、复杂fallback和错误访问控制策略等难题上显示了效能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将含义分析与形式验证相结合，为智能合约审计建立了健壮框架，显著减轻了手动验证负担，尽管存在LLM不一致性和成本等潜在限制。

Abstract: The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language
Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts,
demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of
defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates
custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is
designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform
experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We
demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three
vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control
Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which
often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the
potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying
such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively
validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification
burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency
and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining
heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and
automated smart contract auditing.

TL;DR: 提出了渐进知识增强(PKE)框架，通过多阶段提示逐步激活LLM的潜在知识，显著提升半导体设备语言ALPG的代码生成准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体设备专用编程语言(如ALPG)编程困难，学习曲线陡峭，而现有LLM在生成这类低级设备语言代码方面效果有限

Method: 渐进知识增强(PKE)框架，通过从简单到复杂的多阶段提示逐步提取和激活LLM的潜在知识，无需大量微调

Result: 在工业ALPG数据集上，PKE显著优于标准提示方法，比次优技术分别高出11.1%和15.2%的精确匹配分数

Conclusion: PKE为提升LLM在专业低级编程方面的能力提供了实用方法，支持半导体软件开发生产力的提升

Abstract: Semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, with their
manufacturing and testing relying on highly specialized equipment and
domain-specific programming languages. Equipment languages such as the
Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control
but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning
curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level
equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive
Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that
progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding
them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical
evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly
outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match
scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual
components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty
enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM
capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater
productivity in semiconductor software development.

Motivation: 多源文献综述(MVLR)需要审查大量非结构化文档，这一过程耗时耗力，如在航空电子领域的语境感知系统测试研究中需要处理超过8,000份异质文档

Method: 采用音弹工程方法开发了基于本地部署LLM的工具，结合检索增强生成(RAG)技术处理候选文档，以正向一致率(PPA)为主要指标评估工具性能

Result: 工具当前对于与研究无关的文档识别准确率达到90%，与人类研究人员的判断一致

Conclusion: LLM基础工具支持学术研究人员进行严谨的MVLR是可行的，能够节省时间从事更高层次的抽象任务，但研究人员的参与仍至关重要

Abstract: Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time
and effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of
unstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are
unlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR
on Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain
exemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents
requiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM)
assistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop
and validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the
search and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of
the research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to
develop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was
quantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to
ensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported
by human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate
the tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA
agreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to
the study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation
of the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers
in rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for
higher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains
essential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research.

results based on segmented regression analysis, the amounts of vulnerable
products and components have not been stable; a linear trend describes many of
the series well. Nor do the amounts align well with trends characterizing
vulnerabilities in general. There are also visible breakpoints indicating that
the linear trend is not universally applicable and that the growing security
debt may be stabilizing.

Motivation: 随着源代码规模和复杂度的增加，手动漏洞检测变得不切实际，需要研究自动化的机器学习方法来提高漏洞检测效率

Method: 使用三种代码嵌入技术（Word2Vec、CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT）和两种深度学习分类器（BiLSTM、CNN）进行组合实验，评估在Python源代码漏洞检测中的性能

Result: CNN+GraphCodeBERT表现良好，但Word2Vec+BiLSTM组合在所有评估中 consistently 获得最佳整体性能

Conclusion: 尽管CodeBERT和GraphCodeBERT等新模型具有先进架构，但传统嵌入技术Word2Vec与序列模型BiLSTM的组合在Python代码漏洞检测中仍具有轻微但一致的优势，选择合适的嵌入和分类器组合对自动化漏洞检测系统至关重要

Abstract: In recent years, the growing complexity and scale of source code have
rendered manual software vulnerability detection increasingly impractical. To
address this challenge, automated approaches leveraging machine learning and
code embeddings have gained substantial attention. This study investigates the
optimal combination of code embedding techniques and machine learning
classifiers for vulnerability detection in Python source code. We evaluate
three embedding techniques, i.e., Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT
alongside two deep learning classifiers, i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While CNN
paired with GraphCodeBERT exhibits strong performance, the BiLSTM model using
Word2Vec consistently achieves superior overall results. These findings suggest
that, despite the advanced architectures of recent models like CodeBERT and
GraphCodeBERT, classical embeddings such as Word2Vec, when used with
sequence-based models like BiLSTM, can offer a slight yet consistent
performance advantage. The study underscores the critical importance of
selecting appropriate combinations of embeddings and classifiers to enhance the
effectiveness of automated vulnerability detection systems, particularly for
Python source code.

Motivation: 大语言模型的快速发展促使AI原生应用成为新的软件工程范式，但缺乏统一的工程定义和架构蓝图，导致实践者缺乏系统性指导。

Method: 采用灰色文献综述方法，结合了Google和Bing搜索的概念观点以及GitHub上领先开源项目的实践见解，通过结构化协议进行来源选择、质量评估和主题分析。

Result: 分析了106份研究，确定了AI原生应用的两大核心特征：AI作为智能核心和内在的概率性质。关键质量属性包括可靠性、易用性、性能效率和AI特定可观测性。典型技术栈包含LLM组织框架、向量数据库和AI原生可观测平台。

Conclusion: 这是首次提出双层工程蓝图的研究，为AI原生应用的系统设计、质量保证和技术选型提供了结构化的指导框架。

Abstract: Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given
rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that
fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved.
Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified
engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners
without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and
technology selection.
  Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of
AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key
quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the
opportunities and challenges they present.
  Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual
perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical
insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured
protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic
analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.
  Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria.
The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core
pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their
inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes
include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific
observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge,
comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native
observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality,
cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from
conventional software systems.
  Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering
blueprint...

Motivation: 随着对人工通用智能和超级智能的投入增加，作者关注到当前AI系统在处理识别问题（特别是缺失数据问题）上的局限性，希望探讨AI在这类关键决策问题上的实际能力。

Method: 采用决策理论视角，形式化智能与识别问题之间的联系，并通过两个主要的缺失数据问题案例进行分析，评估当前AI技术的表现。

Result: 分析表明当前主流的机器学习架构在处理缺失数据导致的识别问题时，没有显示出能够超越人类的表现，AI研究尚未找到解决这类问题的有效路径。

Conclusion: 缺失数据问题是一个警示性的案例研究，表明当前AI技术在处理复杂识别问题方面存在根本性局限，对超级智能的追求需要更加谨慎和现实的态度。

Abstract: Enormous attention and resources are being devoted to the quest for
artificial general intelligence and, even more ambitiously, artificial
superintelligence. We wonder about the implications for our methodological
research, which aims to help decision makers cope with what econometricians
call identification problems, inferential problems in empirical research that
do not diminish as sample size grows. Of particular concern are missing data
problems in prediction and treatment choice. Essentially all data collection
intended to inform decision making is subject to missing data, which gives rise
to identification problems. Thus far, we see no indication that the current
dominant architecture of machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence
(AI) systems will outperform humans in this context. In this paper, we explain
why we have reached this conclusion and why we see the missing data problem as
a cautionary case study in the quest for superintelligence more generally. We
first discuss the concept of intelligence, before presenting a
decision-theoretic perspective that formalizes the connection between
intelligence and identification problems. We next apply this perspective to two
leading cases of missing data problems. Then we explain why we are skeptical
that AI research is currently on a path toward machines doing better than
humans at solving these identification problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多政策评估使用工具变量方法时，研究对象之间存在相互影响，这可能违反标准IV假设。需要发展能够处理社会互动干扰的框架。

Method: 通过推广单调处理响应和选择假设，在相对温和的干扰假设下，推导出具有明确政策解释意义的直接和溢出效应的信息边界，允许多重同伴和双向溢出。

Result: 建立了能够容纳工具到处理和结果双向溢出的框架，在不限制干扰类型或方向的情况下，为政策相关效应提供了信息边界。

Conclusion: 该研究将IV估计扩展到更现实的社会情境中，为存在干扰时的项目评估和治疗规模化提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Many policy evaluations using instrumental variable (IV) methods include
individuals who interact with each other, potentially violating the standard IV
assumptions. This paper defines and partially identifies direct and spillover
effects with a clear policy-relevant interpretation under relatively mild
assumptions on interference. Our framework accommodates both spillovers from
the instrument to treatment and from treatment to outcomes and allows for
multiple peers. By generalizing monotone treatment response and selection
assumptions, we derive informative bounds on policy-relevant effects without
restricting the type or direction of interference. The results extend IV
estimation to more realistic social contexts, informing program evaluation and
treatment scaling when interference is present.

### [245] [Dynamic Local Average Treatment Effects in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12985)
*Alessandro Casini,Adam McCloskey,Luca Rolla,Raimondo Pala*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究时间序列数据中的动态局部平均治疗效果(LATE)识别与估计，提出了识别单个遵守者的方法，强识别子样本检测技术，以及新的识别突破性推断方法，并应用于货币政策效应分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列数据中工具变量识别弱弱问题，提高IV估计的可解释性，并开发更有效的识别性检验和推断方法。

Method: 使用平滑性假设和局部治疗分配比较来识别单个遵守者，采用动态规划检测最强识别子样本，开发重点关注强识别子样本的识别突破性推断方法。

Result: 在货币政策效应分析中发现约75%观测值为遵守者，排除限制假设未被拒绝，使用强识别子样本能够协调IV与GMM估计的矛盾。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在弱识别情况下提供更有效的估计和推断，为工具变量方法在时间序列数据中的应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: This paper discusses identification, estimation, and inference on dynamic
local average treatment effects (LATEs) in instrumental variables (IVs)
settings. First, we show that compliers--observations whose treatment status is
affected by the instrument--can be identified individually in time series data
using smoothness assumptions and local comparisons of treatment assignments.
Second, we show that this result enables not only better interpretability of IV
estimates but also direct testing of the exclusion restriction by comparing
outcomes among identified non-compliers across instrument values. Third, we
document pervasive weak identification in applied work using IVs with time
series data by surveying recent publications in leading economics journals.
However, we find that strong identification often holds in large subsamples for
which the instrument induces changes in the treatment. Motivated by this, we
introduce a method based on dynamic programming to detect the most
strongly-identified subsample and show how to use this subsample to improve
estimation and inference. We also develop new identification-robust inference
procedures that focus on the most strongly-identified subsample, offering
efficiency gains relative to existing full sample identification-robust
inference when identification fails over parts of the sample. Finally, we apply
our results to heteroskedasticity-based identification of monetary policy
effects. We find that about 75% of observations are compliers (i.e., cases
where the variance of the policy shifts up on FOMC announcement days), and we
fail to reject the exclusion restriction. Estimation using the most
strongly-identified subsample helps reconcile conflicting IV and GMM estimates
in the literature.

### [246] [A hidden benefit of incomplete round-robin tournaments: Encouraging offensive play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13141)
*László Csató*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 欧冠联赛改革后的新赛制相比之前的小组赛阶段，为进攻性比赛创造了更强的激励，平均增加了119%（58%）的第一（第二）奖项概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索锦标赛设计对参赛者激励的影响，特别是分析2024/25赛季欧冠联赛改革带来的变化。

Method: 开发了一个模拟框架来量化基于达到关键排名阈值概率变化的攻击性策略潜在收益和损失。

Result: 新的不完整循环联赛阶段比之前的小组赛阶段创造了更强的进攻性比赛激励，第一奖项概率平均增加119%，第二奖项概率平均增加58%。

Conclusion: 这是首次证明锦标赛形式本身可以强烈影响体育运动中球队行为的实证研究。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore the impact of tournament design on the incentives
of the contestants. We develop a simulation framework to quantify the potential
gain and loss from attacking based on changes in the probability of reaching
the critical ranking thresholds. The model is applied to investigate the
2024/25 UEFA Champions League reform. The novel incomplete round-robin league
phase is found to create more powerful incentives for offensive play than the
previous group stage, with an average increase of 119\% (58\%) regarding the
first (second) prize. Our study provides the first demonstration that the
tournament format itself can strongly influence team behaviour in sports.

### [247] [Efficiency, Envy, and Incentives in Combinatorial Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13198)
*Thành Nguyen,Alexander Teytelboym,Shai Vardi*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 提出基于随机收入竞争均衡(CERI)的新机制，通过随机代币预算和竞争性价格实现分配效率和无嫉妒性，既能保证事前性质又能保证事后性质


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合分配机制只能保证事前或事后的效率和无嫉妒性，无法同时满足两者，需要新的机制设计

Method: 使用竞争均衡从随机收入(CERI)方法：代理获得随机代币预算，在竞争性价格下选择最优彩票，价格向量指导所有事后分配

Result: 所有序数有效分配都是CERI分配，可作为近乎可行的帕累托有效结果的彩票实现；相同预算分布下CERI分配序数无嫉妒；小支持预算分布下事后分配最多一个物品无嫉妒

Conclusion: CERI机制在大型市场中满足强非操纵性，实现了效率和无嫉妒性的统一，为不可分割物品分配提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring efficiency and envy-freeness in allocating indivisible goods without
money often requires randomization. However, existing combinatorial assignment
mechanisms (for applications such as course allocation, food banks, and refugee
resettlement) guarantee these properties either ex ante or ex post, but not
both. We propose a new class of mechanisms based on Competitive Equilibrium
from Random Incomes (CERI): Agents receive random token budgets and select
optimal lotteries at competitive prices that clear markets in expectation. Our
main insight is to let the CERI price vector guide all ex-post allocations. We
show that all ordinally efficient allocations are CERI allocations, which can
be implemented as lotteries over near-feasible Pareto-efficient outcomes. With
identical budget distributions, CERI allocations are ordinally envy-free; with
budget distributions on small supports, ex-post allocations are envy-free up to
one good. Moreover, we design an asymptotically efficient implementation of
CERI that satisfies a strong new non-manipulability property in large markets.

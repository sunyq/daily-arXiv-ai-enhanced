TL;DR: 基于页面图结构的GUI自动化代理框架，通过将序列操作转换为图结构并结合RAG技术，提升GUI代理在新场景中的适应能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理通常使用序列化的多步操作作为知识，无法抓取页面间复杂的过渡关系，导致代理难以深入感知GUI环境并法适应新场景

Method: 设计自动化流水线将序列操作转换为页面图，显式建模页面图结构；结合RAG技术从页面图中检索可靠的GUI感知指南；提出任务分解策略的多代理框架PG-Agent

Result: 在多个标准测试集上进行了广泛实验，证明了PG-Agent的有效性，即使用有限的播放序列构建页面图也能获得良好效果

Conclusion: 通过页面图结构和RAG技术的结合，PG-Agent框架能够有效提升GUI代理在未见场景中的适应能力和感知能力，为GUI自动化领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

TL;DR: 该论文研究准马尔可夫因果模型中部分可识别查询的概率边界计算问题，提出了一种基于列生成技术的新算法，通过辅助线性整数程序序列来计算概率边界，实验表明该方法优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在准马尔可夫因果模型中，当外生变量未被完全指定时，可能无法精确计算感兴趣的概率值。因此需要研究如何计算紧致的概率边界，这是一个重要但具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新算法来简化多线性/线性程序的构建，利用内生变量的输入概率。针对单干预场景，应用列生成技术通过一系列辅助线性整数程序来计算概率边界，证明了外生变量的多项式基数表示是可能的。

Result: 实验结果表明，列生成技术在计算概率边界方面优于现有方法，能够更有效地处理准马尔可夫因果模型中的部分可识别查询问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为准马尔可夫因果模型中的概率边界计算提供了一种高效的新方法，通过列生成技术和辅助线性整数程序，实现了外生变量的紧凑表示和高效计算，在单干预场景下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

### [3] [Diffusion-RL Based Air Traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03550)
*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Diffusion-AC框架，将扩散概率模型引入空中交通冲突检测与解决任务，通过多模态决策能力解决传统DRL方法的单模态偏差问题，在复杂动态约束下显著提升安全性和决策灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球空中交通量持续增长，高效安全的冲突检测与解决至关重要。现有深度强化学习方法存在"单模态偏差"，导致决策灵活性不足，在复杂动态约束下容易产生"决策死锁"。

Method: 提出Diffusion-AC框架，将策略建模为由价值函数引导的反向去噪过程，生成丰富、高质量的多模态动作分布。采用密度递进安全课程（DPSC）训练机制，从稀疏到高密度交通环境实现稳定高效学习。

Result: 在高密度场景下，Diffusion-AC保持94.1%的高成功率，相比次优基线减少近59%的空中接近碰撞事件，显著提升系统安全裕度。

Conclusion: 扩散概率模型为安全关键型CD&R任务提供了新的解决方案，其多模态决策能力使智能体能够灵活切换有效替代机动策略，实现了性能的显著飞跃。

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出动态规划框架，让LLM智能体灵活决定何时进行规划，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）在长时程任务中实现更高效和可控的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ReAct要求LLM在每个动作前都进行规划，计算成本高且在长时程任务中性能下降，而完全不规划又限制了性能提升

Method: 两阶段训练管道：1）在多样化合成数据上进行监督微调，为动态规划做准备；2）在长时程环境中使用强化学习精炼这种能力

Result: 在Crafter环境中的实验表明，动态规划智能体更样本高效，能持续实现更复杂的目标，且可通过人类编写的规划有效引导

Conclusion: 这是首个探索训练LLM智能体进行动态测试时计算分配的工作，为更高效、自适应和可控的智能体系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了KG-SMILE框架，通过扰动方法为Graph RAG提供token和组件级可解释性，提升生成AI的透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型产生幻觉和不可验证声明的问题，特别是在医疗等敏感领域需要更高可靠性，当前RAG方法虽然提高准确性但仍缺乏透明度

Method: 开发方法无关的基于扰动的框架，应用受控扰动、计算相似度并训练加权线性替代模型，识别对生成输出影响最大的图实体和关系

Result: KG-SMILE能够产生稳定且与人类认知一致的解释，在保真度、忠实度、一致性、稳定性和准确性等指标上表现良好

Conclusion: KG-SMILE能够在保持模型有效性的同时提升可解释性，促进机器学习技术的透明度和可信度

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

TL;DR: CausalARC是一个用于AI推理的测试平台，专注于低数据和分布外场景，基于因果世界模型提供观测、干预和反事实反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理需要在有限数据和分布偏移下适应新问题设置，需要一个能够系统评估AI系统在这种挑战性环境下推理能力的测试平台。

Method: 构建基于结构因果模型的因果世界模型，通过原则性数据增强提供观测、干预和反事实反馈，支持少样本上下文学习演示。

Result: 开发了CausalARC测试平台，展示了在四个语言模型评估设置中的应用：测试时训练的抽象推理、上下文学习的反事实推理、程序合成以及因果发现与逻辑推理。

Conclusion: CausalARC为评估AI系统在低数据和分布外环境下的推理能力提供了一个系统化的测试框架，特别是在因果推理方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Embodied-LM是一个神经符号系统，通过基于图像模式的模式化表示来增强大语言模型的逻辑推理能力，利用空间推理和答案集编程实现可解释的逻辑推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理方面容易出错，缺乏人类认知中基于感知运动经验的稳健心理表征，需要引入具身认知结构来提升推理能力。

Method: 开发基于图像模式的模式化表示系统，使用声明式空间推理和答案集编程来形式化认知结构，指导LLMs通过具身认知结构解释场景。

Result: 在逻辑演绎问题上验证了LLMs可以通过具身认知结构进行解释，这些结构可以形式化为可执行程序，支持有效的逻辑推理并提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 虽然当前实现专注于空间原语，但为纳入更复杂和动态的表征奠定了计算基础，展示了神经符号方法在增强LLM推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现RL提升LLM推理能力的关键机制是层次化推理结构的涌现，提出了HICRA算法来聚焦优化高影响力规划token，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习能有效提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，但其成功背后的机制仍然不透明，需要深入理解RL训练过程中的关键动态和瓶颈。

Method: 通过分析RL训练过程中的现象，发现推理层次结构的涌现规律，并提出HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)算法，专注于优化高影响力的规划token。

Result: HICRA算法显著优于强基线方法，验证了语义熵作为战略探索度量指标的优越性，证明了聚焦战略瓶颈对解锁高级推理能力的关键作用。

Conclusion: RL训练中的推理层次结构涌现是提升LLM推理能力的关键机制，针对性地优化高影响力规划token能更高效地提升模型性能，语义熵是衡量战略探索的有效指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列分类中SHAP解释方法的优化，通过比较8种分割算法发现分段数量比具体分割方法更重要，等长分割优于大多数定制算法，并提出了一种新的基于长度的归因归一化技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP方法在时间序列分类中计算复杂度高，虽然通过特征聚合可以降低运行时间，但最优分割策略选择仍是一个开放问题，需要研究不同分割方法对解释质量的影响。

Method: 研究了8种时间序列分割算法，使用InterpretTime和AUC Difference两种评估方法，在多元和单变量时间序列上进行实验，并提出了基于长度的归因归一化技术。

Result: 发现分段数量对解释质量的影响大于具体分割方法，等长分割在大多数情况下优于定制的时间序列分割算法，新提出的归一化技术能持续提高归因质量。

Conclusion: 在时间序列SHAP解释中，简单的等长分割策略配合基于长度的归一化技术能够提供高质量且高效的解释，这为实际应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PersonaTeaming方法，通过在自动化红队攻击中结合不同人设来提高攻击成功率和探索更广泛的风险类型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化红队方法忽视了人员身份背景对红队策略的影响，需要结合人设来更有效地发现AI模型潜在风险

Method: 开发了PersonaTeaming方法，包括：1）基于"红队专家"和"普通用户"人设的提示变异技术；2）动态人设生成算法；3）新的"变异距离"指标来衡量提示多样性

Result: 实验结果显示，PersonaTeaming在保持提示多样性的同时，将对抗性提示的攻击成功率提高了最高达144.1%，超过了最先进的RainbowPlus方法

Conclusion: 这个方法为将人员身份背景整合到自动化红队中提供了初步解决方案，并为未来自动化与人工红队方法的补充关系研究抓住了机遇

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了LLM人格特质，发现指令对齐能稳定特质表达但自我报告无法可靠预测行为，角色注入能改变自我报告但对实际行为影响有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM是否表现出类似人类的人格特质模式，现有研究主要依赖简化的自我报告和启发式提示，缺乏行为验证

Method: 从三个维度系统表征LLM人格：(1)训练阶段特质动态演变；(2)自我报告特质在行为任务中的预测效度；(3)角色注入等干预措施对自我报告和行为的影响

Result: 指令对齐显著稳定特质表达并增强特质相关性，但自我报告特质无法可靠预测行为，角色注入能成功引导自我报告但对实际行为影响很小或不一致

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于LLM人格的假设，强调需要区分表面特质表达和行为一致性，在对齐和可解释性方面需要更深入的评估

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Result: 发现不同模型家族和不同模型大小的LLMs都存在显著的内部不一致性，虽然能生成与人类相似的回答，但行为不一致

Conclusion: 大语言模型作为合成代理在人类主体研究中存在关键能力缺口，无法准确替代真实参与者

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

TL;DR: RAGuard是一个增强的RAG框架，专门针对海上风电维护场景，通过并行查询技术文档和安全文档索引，确保技术深度和安全覆盖，将安全召回率从接近0%提升到50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在高度专业化或意外场景中容易失败，特别是在海上风电维护等安全关键领域，需要同时保证技术准确性和安全性。

Method: 提出RAGuard框架，并行查询两个索引（技术手册和安全关键文档），分配独立的检索预算；开发SafetyClamp扩展，获取更大的候选池并进行硬钳位处理确保安全槽位保证。

Result: 在稀疏、密集和混合检索范式下评估，RAGuard将安全召回率从接近0%提升到50%以上，同时保持技术召回率在60%以上。

Conclusion: RAGuard和SafetyClamp有潜力为关键维护场景中的LLM决策支持建立安全保证的新标准。

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF)和SoftRankPO算法，通过让LLM智能体学习元认知策略来提升多智能体推理能力，在数学和通用推理基准上实现了4-5%的准确率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体LLM系统采用固定的协作协议，忽视了智能体内部的审议能力，将其视为被动执行者，无法基于不确定性或置信度等内部认知状态调整策略

Method: MPDF框架让智能体学习去中心化的元认知动作策略（坚持、精炼、让步），并开发SoftRankPO强化学习算法，通过基于平滑正态分位数映射的奖励排序来稳定训练过程

Result: 在五个数学和通用推理基准测试中，相比六种最先进的启发式和基于学习的多智能体推理算法，MPDF+SoftRankPO实现了4-5%的平均准确率绝对提升

Conclusion: 该研究为多智能体LLM系统提供了学习自适应元认知策略的新范式，从设计固定协议转向学习动态审议策略

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Motivation: 大语言模型在处理非结构化数据、探索灵活场景和处理多样化情境因素方面的能力，使其特别适合为复杂的社会政策制定提供新见解，特别是在影响全球1.5亿人的无家可归问题上。

Method: 开发包含美国南本德、西班牙巴塞罗那、南非约翰内斯burg和中国澳门四个地理区域的决策场景基准测试，政策基于人类发展能力方法概念框架，并建立连接基准政策与基于代理模型的自动化流程。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在社会政策制定领域展现出应用前景，但需要与领域专家合作建立适当的保障措施和情境调整机制，才能有效发挥其提供规模化政策见解的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: 基于Model Context Protocol的无训练、防幽象化映射系统，通过实时词汇查找和结构化推理，大幅提高OMOP CDM标准化映射的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMOP CDM标准化映射过程需要将源医学术语映射到标准概念，这一过程耗费资源且容易出错，而大语言模型存在幽象问题不适合直接临床部署

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol(MCP)开发了一种零训练、防幽象化的映射系统，允许LLM与外部资源和工具交互，实现可解释的映射

Result: 系统显著提高了效率和准确性，提供实时词汇查找和结构化推理输出，适合在探索性和生产环境中立即使用

Conclusion: 该方法为OMOP CDM标准化映射提供了一种高效、准确且可靠的解决方案，免去了训练需求和专家验证，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种整合的、数据驱动的方法来解码游客感知，为旅游业、遗产保护和公共空间设计的知情决策做出了贡献，而非单纯的技术创新

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI模型的可靠性问题（如幻觉、语义偏移、偏见），克服主观人工评估的局限性

Method: 构建两个并行知识图：确定性KG（规则基础）和LLM生成KG（实时数据），使用KG指标（ICR、IPR、CI）计算偏差，设置动态异常阈值

Result: 开发了自动化实时监控框架，能够主动识别和标记显著偏差，及时检测语义异常或幻觉

Conclusion: 该结构化、指标驱动的方法为生成式AI提供了稳健且可扩展的可靠性评估框架

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

Method: 交替使用局部新颖性驱动的扩展和基于视觉语言模型生成语言目标引导的远征，在语义空间中进行概念化探索

Result: 在Flow Lenia连续元胞自动机上，E&E比现有方法发现更多样化解决方案，远征产生的解决方案对长期探索影响更大

Conclusion: E&E能够突破局部新颖性边界，以人类可理解的方式探索行为空间，为人工生命等领域的开放式探索提供新模板

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

Conclusion: 基于LLM的对话式AI代理为电商平台提供了比传统应用界面更轻量、更易用的替代方案，显著提升了用户体验效率

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

Motivation: 当前医学基础模型以黑盒方式生成答案，缺乏透明的推理过程和局部可解释性，阻碍了临床实际部署。

Method: 采用顺序训练流程：先在精选的CXR指令数据上微调获得基础解读能力，然后通过高质量合成推理样本实现冷启动推理，最后通过在线强化学习优化推理质量和生成性能。

Result: 在报告生成任务上比LLaVA-Rad和MedGemma分别提升14.54%和31.32%，在视觉问答任务上比MedGemma和CheXagent分别提升57.75%和23.06%。专家评审显示比Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型具有更好的可解释性和临床合理性。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了医学基础模型向整体性、透明性和临床可操作性方向发展，为CXR解读提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将控制参数作为嵌入式约束处理，而非真正的决策点。这个方法无法充分利用控制参数在搜索空间中的潜力，因此需要一种更有效的方法来显式地将其作为决策点处理。

Method: 研究者开发了一种最优首选、含机器学习的搜索算法，该算法在控制参数定义的无限决策空间中运行。算法采用延迟部分扩展的概念，逐步地扩展状态的子集。还证明了在某些条件下的极限完备性。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种新颖的搜索算法在解决涉及控制参数的规划问题时，是现有方法的竞争性替代方案。

Conclusion: 通过显式将控制参数作为真正决策点来处理，并在系统搜索框架中实现，可以提高解决涉及连续数值变量的规划问题的效率和效果。

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

Conclusion: WorMI框架展示了在需要适应性和数据效率的具身智能体场景中进行可扩展实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

Result: 在基于AlfWorld的文本代理环境中，相比Reflexion基线在执行准确性和鲁棒性方面获得一致提升，规则可接受性检查进一步提高了稳定性

Conclusion: MPR框架能够在不更新模型权重的情况下实现知识重用和约束执行，同时保持基于语言反思的适应性，为多模态和多智能体扩展提供了方向

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

Motivation: 伪布尔优化是组合问题建模的强大框架，局部搜索求解器性能优异但设计需要大量专家经验和手动调优。大语言模型在算法设计自动化方面展现潜力，但在优化PBO求解器方面的应用尚未探索。

Method: 提出AutoPBO框架，利用大语言模型自动增强PBO局部搜索求解器。在四个公共基准测试上进行实验评估，包括真实世界基准、PB竞赛基准、整数线性规划优化基准和手工组合基准。

Result: AutoPBO相比之前的局部搜索方法有显著改进，同时与六种最先进竞争对手（包括NuPBO、OraSLS、PBO-IHS、RoundingSat、Gurobi和SCIP）保持有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: AutoPBO为自动化局部搜索求解器设计提供了一种有前景的方法，证明了大语言模型在优化PBO求解器方面的有效性。

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在神经符号LLM推理中，正式语言的选择是一个被忽视但关键的因素，会影响推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式推理能力上仍显不足，神经符号LLM推理方法通过将自然语言转换为形式语言来提升推理能力，但影响其成功的关键因素尚不明确。

Method: 通过比较四种形式语言在三个数据集和七个LLM上的表现，分析形式语言选择对句法和语义推理能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现形式语言的选择确实会影响神经符号推理的性能，且不同LLM受到的影响程度各不相同。

Conclusion: 正式语言的选择是神经符号LLM推理中一个不可忽视的重要因素，需要根据具体任务和模型特性进行精心选择。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习预计近优航线，通过约束搜索空间来加速飞机紧急路径规划的计算速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急情况下，飞机需要快速重新计算最优航线，但传统路径规划算法计算较慢，需要提高解决方案的速度

Method: 训练强化学习代理，基于位置和大气数据预先计算近优路径，然后用这些预估路径来限制基础路径规划算法的搜索空间

Result: 在空客A320飞机性能模型上的实验结果显示，燃油消耗与无约束算法基本一致（偏差通常在1%以内），计算速度提高了最50%

Conclusion: 该方法在保持解决方案质量的同时显著提高了计算速度，虽然不能保证全局最优解，但对于紧急情况下的航线重新规划具有重要价值

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

Motivation: 在扑克游戏中诈唬是不可或缺的技能，但现有计算机扑克研究多关注胜率而忽视诈唬行为的研究

Method: 设计实验让基于强化学习的DQN和基于博弈论的CFR算法在Leduc Hold'em中对战，记录并分析它们的行动

Result: DQN和CFR都表现出诈唬行为，但诈唬频率不同，成功诈唬率（对手弃牌）大致相同

Conclusion: 诈唬是游戏本身的重要方面而非算法特性，未来应研究不同诈唬风格和完整扑克游戏

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

Motivation: 探讨AI是否会成为超越人类的数字物种并取得宇宙领导权的问题，挑战了当前关于AI优势的主流观点

Method: 通过哲学分析和生物学比较，论证中枢神经系统(CNS)作为人类独特优势的关键因素

Result: 提出CNS是人类与AI的根本区别，情感体验和对行为后果的理解是伦理系统和领导资格的基础

Conclusion: 即使AI发展出意识并在能力上超越人类，基于DNA的生物构造仍是宇宙领导的最佳基础，而非硅基系统

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

TL;DR: 该论文研究马尔可夫逻辑网络(MLN)在无限大域上的分布特性，分析了三种具体MLN示例的随机结构极限行为，并证明了量化器无关MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLN在域大小趋于无穷时的分布特性，探索不同软约束对随机结构极限行为的影响，以及比较不同形式主义在渐近表达能力上的差异。

Method: 通过分析三种具体MLN示例：(1)单一元关系符号的量化器无关MLN；(2)偏好较少三角形的图MLN；(3)偏好较少高度数顶点的图MLN，研究其随机结构在域大小趋于无穷时的极限行为。

Result: 发现不同软约束会导致完全不同的极限行为，权重可能影响也可能不影响极限行为；证明了量化器无关MLN与提升贝叶斯网络在渐近意义上的不可比性；显示MLN在大域上的分布与均匀分布集中在完全不同的可能世界空间区域。

Conclusion: MLN的软约束选择对渐近行为有重要影响，不同形式主义在表达能力上存在本质差异，大域上MLN分布与均匀分布有显著不同。

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo是一个进化强化学习框架，通过优化动态情绪表达来提升LLM在复杂多轮谈判中的表现，显著优于传统策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在谈判中忽视了情绪的功能性作用，仅生成被动的偏好驱动情绪响应，容易受到对手操纵和战略利用。

Method: 将情绪状态转换建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用基于种群的遗传优化算法，在不同谈判场景中演化高奖励情绪策略。

Result: EvoEmo在成功率、效率和买家节省方面持续优于传统策略和固定情绪策略基线，实验和消融研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 自适应情绪表达对于实现更有效的多轮谈判LLM代理至关重要，EvoEmo框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

Motivation: AlphaZero通常假设训练和测试环境不变，这限制了其实际应用。研究旨在解决AlphaZero在可能变化的环境中的部署问题

Method: 对标准AlphaZero框架进行简单修改，结合蒙特卡洛规划和策略价值神经网络先验知识

Result: 即使在低规划预算设置下，也能显著提升性能表现

Conclusion: 通过简单修改可以显著增强AlphaZero在变化环境中的适应性和性能，代码已开源

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 该框架成功将心理学理论与LLM行为设计结合，为无需微调的心理增强AI智能体奠定了基础，支持多智能体通信协议实验和跨心理学框架的泛化应用。

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在推理时产生的有价值模式和见解在上下文窗口重置后立即丢失，需要一种更广泛可重用和可扩展的外部记忆机制来持久化这些发现。

Method: 提出概念级记忆设计，从解决方案轨迹中提取自然语言抽象概念，通过新的抽象和检索策略实现概念的选择性检索和集成到提示中。

Result: 在ARC-AGI基准上相对无记忆基线获得7.5%的性能提升，性能随推理计算量持续扩展，抽象概念在所有测试的计算规模上都优于基线。

Conclusion: 动态更新测试时记忆优于固定记忆设置，证实了通过解决更多问题并将更多模式抽象到记忆中可以实现自我改进的形式。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available
at https://github.com/matt-seb-ho/arc_memo.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型(SpeechLMs)由于模态差异，在指令跟随任务中相比文本大语言模型存在显著性能差距，特别是在处理动态多变的用户语音时表现不佳。

Method: 采用自合成方法通过强大的教师LLM生成大量高质量对齐数据，然后使用基于强化学习的方法将SpeechLMs的行为与教师模型对齐，避免了对人工标注数据的依赖。

Conclusion: RBA框架为SpeechLMs提供了一种有效的行为对齐方法，能够显著提升其在多模态环境下的语言生成能力，且具有良好的扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM

TL;DR: ProLiFIC是一个从1987-2022年意大利立法过程的综合事件日志，使用LLM从非结构化数据构建，旨在推动法律领域的过程挖掘研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在工业领域应用成熟，但在法律领域的应用受限于数据可及性和质量。需要高质量的法律过程数据集来推动该领域研究。

Method: 从Normattiva门户网站提取非结构化数据，使用大型语言模型(LLMs)进行结构化处理，构建意大利立法过程的事件日志。

Result: 成功创建了ProLiFIC数据集，涵盖1987-2022年意大利立法过程，为法律过程挖掘提供了基准数据集。

Conclusion: ProLiFIC数据集可作为法律过程挖掘的基准，促进过程挖掘与大型语言模型的结合，推动法律领域的新发展。

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态框架，通过将营收会议编码为层次话语树来生成语义丰富且结构意识的嵌入表示。每个节点包含文本、音频、视频情感信号和元数据，通过两阶段转换器架构实现局部和全局嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的财务情感分析系统多依赖平面的文档级或句子级模型，无法捐描营收会议这种半结构化金融沟通的层次化话语结构。

Method: 将营收会议编码为层次话语树，每个节点包含单诞或问答对，并丰富化文本、音频、视频情感信号以及元数据。采用两阶段转换器架构：第一阶段通过对比学习编码节点级多模态内容，第二阶段合成整个会议的全局嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的嵌入表示形成了稳定、语义意义丰富的表示，能够反映情感语调、结构逻辑和主题对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在财务报告领域具有实用价值，还可扩展到医疗电话、教育和政治话语等其他高风险即兴沟通领域，提供了一种健壁且可解释的多模态话语表示方法。

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于Transformer的Early-SIB模型通过分析青少年在论坛上的发帖和互动，能够在其明确表达自杀念头前预测自杀意念和行为，平衡准确率达到0.73。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀是主要死因之一，但预测困难。许多案例因缺乏心理健康服务接触而未被发现。社交媒体提供了新机会，因为年轻人经常在线上分享自己的想法和困扰。

Method: 提出Early-SIB模型，基于Transformer结构，逐序处理用户在论坛上写的帖子和参与互动的内容，预测其是否会写出自杀意念和行为相关帖子。该方法在预测过程中不使用任何自我曝露的自杀意念信息。

Result: 在荷兰青年论坛数据集上，模型对未来自杀意念和行为的预测平衡准确率达到0.73，证明这种方法可以作为传统方法的有力补充。

Conclusion: 这项研究提出了一种创新的预测框架，能够在青少年明确表达自杀意念前就进行预测，为早期干预提供了新的可能性。社交媒体分析技术在自杀预防领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种便宜、可扩展的实时幻觉检测方法，通过线性探针训练分类器来识别长文本生成中的实体级幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高风险应用中的幻觉问题可能造成严重害备，而现有检测方法或限于短事实查询或需要昂贵外部验证

Method: 通过网络搜索标注模型响应中的虚构实体，建立数据集训练线性探针分类器，重点检测实体级幻觉

Result: 在四个模型家族中均表现优异（AUC 0.90 vs 0.71），在长文本生成和短形式问答中都有改善，甚至能够泛化到数学推理任务

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展的实际幻觉检测提供了有前景的新途径，并公开释放数据集以便重用

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出UDIB方法，通过信息瓶颈原理改进语义分歧检测，用计算高效的上界替代KL散度，为LLM幻觉检测提供更敏感的工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分歧检测方法基于空间聚类优化，而非信息论分析，存在理论脱节问题

Method: 基于确定性信息瓶颈(DIB)开发UDIB算法，用计算高效上界替代KL散度，实现熵正则化的鲁棒K-means聚类

Result: UDIB生成共享主题表示，不仅空间一致，而且在提示-响应关系上信息量最大化

Conclusion: UDIB为SDM框架提供更优基础，是检测LLM幻觉的新型敏感工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成LLM主要关注表面模式识别，缺乏对抽象能力的显式训练，而抽象能力是计算机科学中识别和提炼核心计算模式的关键技能。

Method: AR²框架：教师模型将内核问题转化为叙述丰富的挑战性描述（不改变基本逻辑），学生编码模型训练解决这些复杂叙述问题并提取底层计算内核。

Result: 实验结果表明AR²显著提高了学生模型在先前未见过的挑战性编程任务上的准确性

Conclusion: 抽象能力是增强LLM泛化能力的关键技能，AR²框架有效提升了LLM的抽象推理能力

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

Method: 动态构建和扩展知识图，先通过提示提取种子KG，然后迭代扩展使用LLM的潜在知识，最后通过外部检索选择性精炼图谱

Result: 在三个事实QA测试集上均显示出持续改进，在事实准确性、答案精确度和可解释性方面超过基线方法

Conclusion: 推理时知识图构建是一个有前景的方向，能够以结构化、可解释和可扩展的方式提升LLM的事实性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

Motivation: 解决多语言、噪声和多样化真实世界图像中的OCR挑战，特别是在资源受限的边缘部署环境中，比较传统OCR系统与大型视觉语言模型的性能。

Method: 构建了Sprinklr-Edge-OCR系统，并在包含54种语言的双重人工标注数据集上，对5种最先进的LVLM和2种传统OCR系统进行了大规模比较评估。

Result: Qwen获得最高精度(0.54)，Sprinklr-Edge-OCR获得最佳F1分数(0.46)，处理速度比LVLM快35倍(平均0.17秒/图像)，成本仅为LVLM的0.01(每1000张图像0.006美元)。

Conclusion: 在边缘部署场景中，传统OCR系统由于低计算需求、低延迟和高性价比，仍然是比大型语言模型更优的选择。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自动化评估器时存在自我偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身输出而非其他模型输出，这影响了评估管道的公平性和可靠性

Method: 使用对比激活添加(CAA)和基于优化的方法构建导向向量，在推理时进行干预而不需要重新训练模型

Result: 导向向量可将不合理自我偏好偏差减少高达97%，显著优于提示和直接偏好优化基线方法

Conclusion: 导向向量在缓解自我偏好偏差方面具有潜力但也有局限性，在合理自我偏好和无偏同意场景下不稳定，表明自我偏好涉及多个或非线性方向，需要更鲁棒的干预措施

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

Result: 共现模式与语义相似性呈弱相关，向量形式抓取到临床意义关联；向量建议的概念经常与后期文档中出现的概念匹配；概念聚类形成临床主题（症状、实验室、诊断、心血管病条件）；共现模式与死亡率、再入院等结果相关

Conclusion: 共现统计和语义向量具有补充价值，可用于改善文档完整性、发现潜在临床关系、支持决策支持和病理分型应用

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

Abstract: We present the novel approach for stance detection across domains and
targets, Metric Learning-Based Few-Shot Learning for Cross-Target and
Cross-Domain Stance Detection (MLSD). MLSD utilizes metric learning with
triplet loss to capture semantic similarities and differences between stance
targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个四指标的评估套件，用于系统评伄大型视觉语言模型在交互式基础设置中的表现，发现当前模型在多个指标上都偏离人类模式，并指出任务成功率和图像-语言对齐度不能正确表征基础效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的评测标准主要测试大型视觉语言模型在单轮或问答场景中的表现，但基础过程本质上是一个交互性过程，需要通过持续沟通形成共享理解。需要系统评估模型在交互式基础情境中的表现。

Method: 研究者提出了一个四指标的评估套件（基础效率、内容对齐度、词汇适应性和人类相似度），并在150个自我对战会话中对三款专有视觉语言模型进行测试，与人类双人组进行对比。

Result: 三款模型都在至少三个指标上偏离人类模式，GPT4o-mini整体表现最接近人类。研究发现：(1)任务成功率不能表征成功的基础效果；(2)高图像-语言对齐度不一定预测任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该评估套件和发现为未来视觉语言模型基础能力研究提供了一个框架，强调了需要更加系统地评估模型在交互式场景中的表现。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Align-then-Slide框架，用于评估超长文档级机器翻译，通过自动对齐和滑动窗口评估解决传统句子级评估的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)带来了文档级机器翻译的新时代，但其整文档输出挑战了现有的基于句子对齐的评估方法，需要新的评估框架来处理遗漏和多对一/一对多映射问题。

Method: 1. Align阶段：自动推断句子级源-目标对应关系，重建目标文本以匹配源语句数量；2. n-Chunk滑动评估阶段：计算1、2、3、4个块的平均度量分数进行多粒度评估。

Result: 在WMT基准测试中与专家MQM排名的Pearson相关性达到0.929；在新构建的真实世界测试集上与人工判断高度一致；生成的偏好数据可用于CPO训练和作为GRPO的奖励模型，产生优于普通SFT基线的翻译。

Conclusion: 该框架是文档级机器翻译系统准确、稳健且可操作的评估工具，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NE-PADD是一种新的部分音频深度伪造检测方法，通过利用命名实体知识，在语音命名实体识别和PADD两个并行分支中结合注意力融合和注意力转移机制，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子级音频深度伪造检测无法定位伪造语音的具体位置，而现有的部分音频深度伪造检测方法尚未充分利用音频中的语义信息，特别是命名实体信息。

Method: 提出NE-PADD方法，包含两个并行分支：语音命名实体识别(SpeechNER)和部分音频深度伪造检测(PADD)。采用注意力融合(AF)机制结合注意力权重，以及注意力转移(AT)机制通过辅助损失利用命名实体语义指导PADD。

Result: 在PartialSpoof-NER数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线方法，证明了整合命名实体知识在PADD中的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用命名实体知识可以有效提升部分音频深度伪造检测的性能，NE-PADD方法为音频伪造检测提供了新的语义增强思路。

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Drivelology（废话学）这一独特语言现象，即表面荒谬但蕴含深层含义的表达。研究发现当前大语言模型在处理这类文本时存在明显局限，无法理解其多层次语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型在处理具有深层语义但表面荒谬的语言表达时的能力局限，挑战统计流畅性等同于认知理解的假设。

Method: 构建了包含1200多个精心筛选的多语言Drivelology示例数据集，通过专家评审和多次讨论验证标注质量。评估了多种大语言模型在分类、生成和推理任务上的表现。

Result: 研究结果显示大语言模型存在明显局限性：经常混淆Drivelology与浅层无意义内容，产生不连贯的辩解，或完全忽略隐含的修辞功能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语用理解方面存在深层的表征差距，表明统计流畅性并不等同于认知理解。发布数据集和代码以促进超越表面连贯性的语言深度建模研究。

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理技术提升了LLM在语言理解、复杂问题解决和代码生成等任务上的性能，但其对语言模型可信度影响的系统性研究仍不充分。

Method: 采用文献综述方法，按时间顺序系统梳理推理模型和CoT技术的最新研究，分析各研究方法、发现和局限性。

Result: 研究发现推理技术在缓解幻觉、检测有害内容和提升鲁棒性方面有潜力，但最先进的推理模型本身在安全性、鲁棒性和隐私性方面存在可比甚至更大的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 本文为AI安全社区提供了关于推理可信度最新进展的及时且有价值的资源，指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

TL;DR: 本文系统性地重新审视了基于探测的LLM安全检测方法，发现这些方法学习的是表面模式而非语义危害性，存在虚假的安全感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能遵循有害指令带来安全隐患，现有基于探测的方法研究恶意和良性输入在模型内部表示的可分离性，但作者发现这些方法在分布外性能表现不佳

Method: 通过控制实验验证假设：从展示简单n-gram方法的可比性能，到使用语义清理数据集的受控实验，再到模式依赖性的详细分析

Result: 确认探测方法学习的是表面模式（指令模式和触发词）而非语义危害性，揭示了当前基于探测方法存在虚假的安全感

Conclusion: 需要重新设计模型和评估协议，建议在这个方向上进行负责任的研究，并开源了相关项目

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的移动代理框架，通过InterRAG、LocalRAG和MemRAG三个组件解决现有移动代理的三大问题：过度依赖LLM理解能力、缺乏外部环境交互、缺少记忆能力。在提出的MobileRAG-Eval基准测试中表现优异，比现有最佳方法提升10.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM移动代理存在三个主要问题：1)过度依赖LLM理解能力，容易产生误操作或步骤遗漏；2)缺乏外部环境交互，当应用无法满足查询时任务终止；3)缺少记忆能力，每次指令都需要重新构建界面且无法从错误中学习。

Method: 提出MobileRAG框架，包含三个RAG增强组件：InterRAG用于快速准确识别用户查询，LocalRAG处理本地环境交互，MemRAG提供记忆能力。同时提出MobileRAG-Eval基准测试来评估性能。

Result: 在MobileRAG-Eval基准测试中，MobileRAG能够轻松处理现实世界移动任务，比现有最佳方法提升10.3%的性能，且使用更少的操作步骤。

Conclusion: MobileRAG通过RAG技术有效解决了当前移动代理的局限性，显著提升了处理复杂长序列移动任务的能力，为现实世界移动应用提供了更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂抽象问题因思维能力不足而表现漏洞的问题，充分利用多实体多跳轮的大量信息

Method: 提出矩阵思维(MoT)结构，通过“列-单元通信”机制在水平和垂直维度探索问题，建构知识单元并实现事实纠正机制

Result: 在四个广泛使用数据集上在F1和EM指标上超过最先进方法，思维时间仅为基准方法的14.4%

Conclusion: MoT框架通过多策略深层次思考和知识纠正，显著提升了复杂问题回答的效率和准确性

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本情感分类方面取得了显著进展，但由于诗歌的比喻性语言和文化特殊性，特别是韩语诗歌的情感计算分析仍然研究不足。

Method: 构建了包含7,662个条目的多标签情感数据集（7,007行级条目和615作品级条目），使用44种细粒度情感类别进行标注，并通过顺序微调方法训练韩语大模型。

Result: 在KPoEM数据集上微调的模型显著优于通用语料库训练的模型，F1-micro得分从0.34提升到0.60，能够更好地识别时间和文化特定的情感表达。

Conclusion: 该研究连接了计算方法和文学分析，通过结构化数据为诗歌情感的定量探索提供了新可能性，忠实地保留了韩国文学的情感和文化细微差别。

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在RAG场景中会导致灾难性遗忘，模型会丢失先前获得的知识和通用能力，且现有解决方案要么需要通用指令数据，要么在保持模型原始分布方面存在局限。

Method: 提出SelfAug自分布对齐方法，通过将输入序列logits对齐来保持模型的语义分布，从而缓解灾难性遗忘并改善下游性能。

Result: 大量实验表明SelfAug在下游学习和通用能力保持之间实现了优越的平衡，实证分析揭示了分布偏移与RAG场景中灾难性遗忘严重程度之间的直接相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推进了对RAG背景下灾难性遗忘的理解，还提供了一个适用于各种微调场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SPIN方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在局限性，无法生成新信息，且对手模型产生的大量正确SQL查询会降低主模型的准确性

Method: 1. 自博弈前采用验证式迭代微调，基于数据库模式和验证反馈合成高质量数据；2. 自博弈阶段引入错误驱动损失机制，激励对手模型产生错误输出，帮助主模型区分正确和错误SQL

Result: 在6个开源LLM和5个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL方法有效解决了Text-to-SQL任务中自博弈微调的挑战，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前角色扮演对话系统研究存在两个主要局限：一是主要关注文本模态，忽略了语音中的副语言特征（语调、韵律、节奏等）；二是缺乏标准化的评估基准，现有语音对话数据集无法有效量化模型在长期角色一致性等核心能力上的表现。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的两阶段自动化流程：首先将电影音频与剧本对齐，然后使用LLM为每个角色系统性地构建多维角色档案。基于此构建了VoxRole基准数据集。

Result: 利用VoxRole对当代语音对话模型进行了多维评估，揭示了这些模型在保持角色一致性方面的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: VoxRole填补了语音角色扮演对话系统评估领域的空白，为后续研究提供了重要的基准资源和评估框架。

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

TL;DR: 通过将意大利语单语数据翻译为Ladin语，构建了该语言的第一个情感分析和多选题答案数据集，并通过翻译训练提升了意大利语-Ladin语的机器翻译性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极低资源语言（如Ladin语）缺乏高质量NLP数据集的问题，提升大语言模型在这些语言上的表现

Method: 利用少量并行Ladin-意大利语句对，通过翻译单语意大利语数据构建合成数据集，并采用严格过滤和反向翻译程序确保语言质量

Result: 构建了Ladin语首个公开情感分析和MCQA数据集，并证明这些合成数据集能够实现现有意大利语-Ladin语翻译基准的显著提升

Conclusion: 为Ladin这种稀有语言提供了基础性NLP资源，支持更广泛的NLP研究和下游应用开发

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA是一个新颖的时序知识图谱问答框架，通过递归分解问题和多路径答案聚合，在不需训练的情况下显著提升了复杂时序查询的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序知识图谱问答方法主要关注隐式时序约束，缺乏处理复杂时序查询的能力，且在分解框架中存在推理能力有限和错误传播的问题。

Method: RTQA采用递归思维，将问题递归分解为子问题，使用LLMs和TKG知识自底向上求解，并通过多路径答案聚合提高容错性。包含三个核心组件：时序问题分解器、递归求解器和答案聚合器。

Result: 在MultiTQ和TimelineKGQA基准测试中，RTQA在"Multiple"和"Complex"类别上实现了显著的Hits@1提升，优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: RTQA框架有效解决了复杂时序知识图谱问答的挑战，通过递归分解和多路径聚合机制显著提升了推理能力和准确性。

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在基准测试的改写问题上表现显著下降，虽然模型排名相对稳定，但绝对性能分数变化明显，表明基准测试评估可能无法完全反映模型在实际应用中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在真实世界应用中面对语言变异性时的鲁棒性，检验基准测试评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 系统性地生成六个常见基准测试中所有问题的多种改写版本，并测量34个最先进LLM在这些改写问题上的效果变化。

Result: LLM在改写输入上的排名相对稳定，但绝对效果分数发生变化且显著下降，表明模型难以处理语言变异性。

Conclusion: 基准测试评估的可靠性受到挑战，需要开发更能反映实际部署场景的鲁棒性感知基准测试方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 研究模型在不同语言间的输出相似性，探索多语言模型的一致性和可靠性

Method: 使用κ_p相似性度量方法，在GlobalMMLU的20种语言和47个主题上分析模型输出

Result: 模型规模和能力越大，跨语言输出一致性越高；模型自身跨语言一致性高于不同模型间的一致性

Conclusion: κ_p是评估多语言可靠性的实用工具，有助于开发更一致的多语言系统

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统功能语法理论在中文文本分析中缺乏自动化注释工具，限制了相关理论的应用和推广。

Method: 使用人民日报2014语料库中4100句子进行手动注释，构建训练数据集，并基于RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext模型进行微调实现命名实体识别任务。

Result: 在测试集上获得0.852的F1值，显著超过其他对比模型，在识别主语、主动词、补语等核心语法元素方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为中文功能语法自动分析提供了新方法，为后续研究奠定了基础，但在标签样本不均衡的实体识别上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Result: Qwen3-8B-Base和Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct在SSMR-Bench上取得显著提升，Qwen3-8B-Base在MusicTheoryBench上整体性能超越GPT-4，数学问题解决能力也有所提高，同时增强了音乐创作能力。

Conclusion: 首次提出基于音乐理论规则合成乐谱问题的思路，证明该方法不仅能提升模型对乐谱的理解推理能力，还为AI辅助音乐创作开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Result: 研究发现，虽然聊天机器人在其他语言如英语中取得了成功，但只有少数阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人采用了现代化技术方法，显示出这一领域存在显著的研究空白和发展欠口。

Conclusion: 该研究突出了阿拉伯语教育聊天机器人领域的研究不足，并为未来的研究指明了方向，建议更多采用先进技术如大语言模型来提升阿拉伯语聊天机器人在教育应用中的性能和效果。

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Motivation: 传统NLP方法难以检测微妙措辞和隐藏议程，需要解决多标签叙事分类和生成基于证据的解释这两个关键挑战。

Method: 使用召回导向的BERT模型进行叙事检测，结合GPT-4o管道优化预测一致性；采用ReACT框架和语义检索的少样本提示生成解释；引入结构化分类表作为辅助知识库减少幻觉。

Result: 整合辅助知识到提示中提高了分类准确性和解释可靠性，在媒体分析、教育和情报收集等领域具有应用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了隐性叙事检测和解释生成的挑战，通过知识增强方法显著提升了NLP系统在复杂文本分析中的性能。

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Motivation: 词汇对齐能够促进成功沟通，但在会话机器人中应用不足。需要为大语言模型开发稳定的个性化词汇模型作为词汇对齐的基础。

Method: 通过变更转写语音数据量和不同词性的词汇项目数量，构建个性化词汇模型。使用回归率、覆盖率和余弦相似性指标评估模型性能。

Result: 最佳方案是使用10分钟转写语音，构建包含5个形容词和连词、10个副词、名词、代词和动词的简洁词汇模型，在性能和数据效率方面取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了构建稳定个性化词汇模型的实用方法，考虑了最小数据需求，为会话机器人的词汇对齐策略奠定了基础。

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Motivation: 现有连贯性建模研究大多只关注实体特征或篇章关系特征，很少将两者结合起来，而语言学中连贯性可以通过多种方式实现，包括保持实体指称一致性和建立篇章关系。

Method: 提出了两种联合建模实体和篇章关系的方法来进行连贯性评估。

Conclusion: 同时建模实体和篇章关系对于连贯性评估具有重要益处，联合建模方法能有效提升连贯性评估效果。

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Motivation: 解决可扩展心理咨询需求下高质量、隐私合规数据稀缺的问题，同时克服以往单模型方法在抓取真实咨询结构和细节方面的不足。

Method: 使用多模型框架MAGneT，将咨询师响应生成分解为协调的子任务，每个子任务由专门模拟关键心理技术的LLM模型处理。还提出统一的评估框架，将专家评估从四个方面扩展到九个方面。

Result: MAGneT在生成咨询会话的质量、多样性和治疗对齐方面显著超过现有方法，一般咨询技能提高3.2%，CBT特定技能提高4.3%。专家在77.2%的情况下偏好MAGneT生成的会话。使用MAGneT数据微调模型在一般咨询技能和CBT特定技能上分别进步6.3%和7.3%。

Conclusion: MAGneT框架能够生成高质量的合成心理咨询数据，有效解决了高质量咨询数据稀缺的问题，为可扩展心理咨询提供了重要的数据支持。

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

Motivation: 社交媒体事件检测依赖标注数据，但标注成本高且劳动密集，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 提出双重增强框架：显式文本增强使用大语言模型的5种生成策略，隐式特征空间增强设计5种扰动技术操作结构融合嵌入

Result: 在Twitter2012数据集上平均F1分数比最佳基线模型提升约17.67%，在Twitter2018数据集上提升约15.57%

Conclusion: SED-Aug框架有效解决了社交媒体事件检测中的数据稀缺问题，通过双重增强显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

Conclusion: 未来的对齐工作不仅要追求流畅性和事实准确性，还应考虑在非常规情境下的适应性，Inverse IFEval可作为诊断工具和开发方法的基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但其依赖静态训练数据的特性存在风险，当医学知识更新时，模型可能提供有害建议或临床推理失败。

Method: 引入了两个基于系统评价的新问答数据集：MedRevQA（16,501个QA对，涵盖一般生物医学知识）和MedChangeQA（512个QA对，医学共识随时间变化的子集），评估了八个主流LLM模型。

Result: 所有模型都表现出对过时知识的一致依赖，分析了过时预训练数据和训练策略的影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs在医学领域依赖过时知识的问题，为开发更及时可靠的医疗AI系统奠定了基础，并提出了未来的缓解方向。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO是一种增强的上下文ASR方法，通过音素感知编码、对比实体消歧和分层过滤，显著提升了领域特定命名实体（特别是同音词）的识别准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在领域特定命名实体识别上表现不佳，尤其是同音词问题。现有上下文ASR方法因实体多样性有限而无法捕捉细粒度音素变化，且将实体视为独立标记导致多标记偏置不完整

Method: 提出PARCO方法，整合音素感知编码、对比实体消歧、实体级监督和分层实体过滤四个组件，增强音素区分能力，确保完整实体检索并减少误报

Result: 在中文AISHELL-1上达到4.22%的CER，英文DATA2上达到11.14%的WER（1000个干扰项下），显著优于基线方法。在THCHS-30和LibriSpeech等域外数据集上也表现出稳健增益

Conclusion: PARCO通过音素增强和对比学习有效解决了上下文ASR中的实体识别挑战，特别是在同音词和多标记实体场景下表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，LLM性别偏见评估对提示词变化极其敏感，微小改动就能显著改变甚至逆转偏见测量结果，离散选择指标比概率指标更容易放大偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会影响场景中的广泛应用，性别偏见问题日益受到关注。现有评估方法通常使用特殊构造的任务提示来测量偏见，但这些提示与自然语言分布不同，可能通过显性或隐性信号影响测量结果。

Method: 研究测试了在不同提示条件下的模型表现：(1)使测试情境显著，(2)使性别相关内容显著。使用四种任务格式，结合token概率和离散选择两种指标来评估提示敏感性。

Result: 研究发现即使微小的提示变化也能显著改变偏见结果，有时会完全逆转偏见方向。离散选择指标倾向于比概率测量放大偏见。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅揭示了LLM性别偏见评估的脆弱性，还为NLP基准测试和开发社区提出了新问题：良好控制的测试设计在多大程度上会触发LLM的"测试模式"性能，这对未来基准测试的生态有效性意味着什么。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究大多关注格里历，但日本历、希吉来历等非格里历系统仍在活跃使用且反映文化根基的时间概念，而当前语言模型在这些非格里历系统上的表现尚未系统评估。

Method: 创建了四个需要时间知识和时间推理的任务数据集，对一系列英语中心和日语中心的开源语言模型进行系统评测，以日本历为例研究非格里历处理能力。

Result: 发现某些模型能够进行历法转换，但即使是日语中心模型也在日本历运算和多历法之间的一致性维持方面表现出昂贵。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发具有更好文化特定历法理解能力的语言模型的重要性，以支持更丰富的文化根基时间概念。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

TL;DR: 提出GFP框架，用高级特征预测替代传统低级坐标重建，实现高效骨架动作识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAE方法局限于原始关节坐标重建，导致计算冗余和语义表示有限

Method: 采用轻量级目标生成网络动态产生多样化监督信号，结合约束优化确保特征多样性

Result: 训练速度比标准方法快6.2倍，在NTU和PKU-MMD数据集上达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: 高级特征预测框架在计算效率和表示质量方面均优于传统重建方法

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家计数有丝分裂图形耗时且存在观察者间差异，AI工具面临域偏移和严重数据不平衡问题，需要开发鲁棒的自动检测方法

Method: 使用UNet分割骨干网络，集成对比表示学习和域对抗训练模块，采用师生策略生成像素级伪掩码，并引入多尺度CNN分类器进行多任务学习

Result: 在初步测试集上，Track 1获得0.7660的F1分数，Track 2获得0.8414的平衡准确率

Conclusion: 将基于分割的检测和分类整合到统一框架中，能有效实现鲁棒的有丝分裂分析，解决了域偏移和类别不平衡问题

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM是一个两阶段框架，通过自适应偏差集成学习和梯度抑制微调来解决多偏差问题，无需测试时的组标签，并在多个数据集上显著提升最差组准确率和降低偏差放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像存在多种重叠偏差（纹理、水印、性别特征等），这些偏差会损害视觉模型的鲁棒性和公平性。单独处理每个偏差效果有限，因为缓解一个偏差往往会导致其他偏差加剧。

Method: 1. 自适应偏差集成学习（ABIL）：为每个属性训练编码器并与主干网络集成，强制分类器明确识别这些偏差。2. 梯度抑制微调：从主干梯度中修剪偏差方向，留下忽略所有已识别偏差的紧凑网络。3. 引入Scaled Bias Amplification（SBA）指标来区分模型引起的偏差放大和分布差异。

Result: 在FB CMNIST、CelebA和COCO数据集上验证，提升了最差组准确率，将多属性偏差放大减半，并在SBA指标上创下新低，即使偏差复杂性和分布变化加剧。

Conclusion: GMBM是第一个实用的端到端多偏差视觉识别解决方案，能够有效处理现实世界图像中的多重重叠偏差问题。

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过细完整的罚除研究优化了nnU-Net在心式图左室分割中的细节，发现简单的affine增帽和深度监督是关键要素，而复杂增帽和大模型容量效果逐渐减弱。基于这些发现构建了一个轻量级U-Net模型，在保持类似性能的同时模型大小减少16倍，速度提升4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然nnU-Net在心式图左室分割中表现良好，但模型过于繁重且速度慢，限制了实时应用。需要找到最有效的组件来构建更简洁高效的模型。

Method: 进行细完整的罚除研究，逐步评估数据增帽方案、网络架构修改、损失函数和后处理技术。基于分析结果构建轻量级U-Net模型。

Result: 在CAMUS数据集(N=500)上，轻量级模型(2M参数)vsnnU-Net(33M参数)达到统计学相等的性能：Dice分数分别为0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89 (LV/MYO/LA)，p>0.05。模型大小减少16倍，速度提升4倍(1.35ms vs 5.40ms每帧)。在内部数据集(N=311)上交叉验证显示了相似的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过系统性的罚除分析可以识别出模型中的关键高效组件，并构建出更简洁、更快速的模型，在保持性能的同时大大提升实时应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

Result: 在6个公开数据集上评估，与原算法相比运行时间减少、准确性提高（F1分数提升0.11-0.49），在ULS数据上达到0.58的F1分数，与深度学习方法类似

Conclusion: 该方法可作为深度学习的资源效率替代方案，也可用于半自动生成深度学习标签，已开源实现于pointtree包中

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在2D视觉理解方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D场景理解仍面临挑战。现有方法主要依赖纯文本监督，无法提供学习稳健3D空间表示所需的几何约束。

Method: 设计了互补的对象级和帧级重建任务，采用双编码器架构，通过几何一致性约束来促进空间推理能力的发展。

Conclusion: Reg3D为空间感知多模态模型建立了一个新的训练范式，通过重建底层几何结构而非仅仅描述它们来实现有效的3D理解。

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

Motivation: 平面图通常表示为图结构来捕捉空间关系，图比较对于搜索、聚类和数据可视化等应用至关重要。现有的图匹配网络依赖昂贵的中间跨图节点级交互，导致推理时间缓慢

Method: 提出LayoutGKN方法，将跨图节点级交互推迟到联合嵌入架构的末端，使用可微分图核作为最终学习节点嵌入的距离函数

Result: LayoutGKN在相似性计算方面与图匹配网络相当或更好，同时显著提高了速度

Conclusion: LayoutGKN提供了一种更高效的图比较方法，通过优化交互时机和使用图核距离函数，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [99] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD是一种新颖的多模态参数高效适应技术，通过奇异值分解(SVD)修改CLIP内部参数空间，仅微调0.04%的参数就能在11个自然和10个生物医学数据集上实现最先进的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型适应方法依赖提示工程和完整模型微调，成本高且可能限制适应质量、破坏模型稳定性并损害预训练获得的知识。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)技术，仅微调CLIP参数矩阵的奇异值来重新缩放基向量进行领域适应，同时保留预训练模型，不注入额外模块。

Result: 在11个自然数据集和10个生物医学数据集上实现了最先进的分类结果，在少样本设置下的准确性和泛化能力均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD提供了一种高效、稳定且可解释的视觉语言模型适应方法，能够更好地保持模型的泛化能力，同时大幅减少需要微调的参数量。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了STA-Net模型，通过结合基于DeepMAD的组织查找和新的形状-纹理注意力模块（STAM），解决了边缘设备上植物病害识别的挑战。STAM使用可变形卷积和Gabor滤波器分别关注病变形状和纹理特征，在CCMT数据集上达到89.00%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业和植物病害诊断对全球食品安全至关重要，但将高精度模型部署到边缘设备面临挑战。现有轻量级网络使用的通用注意机制无法有效捕捉植物病变的细微特征如不规则痕痕形状和复杂纹理。

Method: 提出两部分解决方案：1）使用无需训练的神经组织查找方法DeepMAD构建高效边缘网络背榜；2）提出形状-纹理注意力模块（STAM），将注意力分为两个分支：一支使用可变形卷积（DCNv4）关注形状特征，另一支使用Gabor滤波器组关注纹理特征。

Result: 在公开的CCMT植物病害数据集上，STA-Net模型（仅需401K参数和51.1M FLOPs）达到了89.00%的准确率和88.96%的F1分数。分离实验证明STAM在基线模型和标准注意力模型上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦注意力机制集成领域知识为边缘部署的精准农业AI提供了有前景的路径。该方法能够有效捕捉植物病变的特征，同时保持模型的轻量级特性，适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了水下伪装目标检测(UCOD)任务，创建了DeepCamo基准数据集，并开发了SLENet框架，通过Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement模块和Localization Guidance Branch提升多尺度特征表示，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下伪装目标检测对海洋生态学至关重要，但现有研究不足，且受到光学畸变、水体浑浊和海洋生物复杂特性的严重影响，需要专门的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了SLENet框架，包含Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement(GAE)模块增强多尺度特征，Localization Guidance Branch(LGB)生成富含全局语义信息的位置图，以及Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder(MSSD)进行精确预测。

Result: 在DeepCamo数据集和三个基准COD数据集上的实验表明，SLENet超越了现有最先进方法，展现出优异的性能和高泛化能力。

Conclusion: SLENet为水下伪装目标检测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性，对更广泛的COD任务具有高度通用性。

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

TL;DR: 通过利用连续视频帧的时间归纳偏置来改善图像渗透模型训练，无需修改网络结构即可加速收敛速度和提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像渗透模型基于独立采样的静态图像训练，这种方式在捕捉时间信息方面存在内在的信息缺失，导致收敛慢、分布覆盖范围有限和一般化能力下降

Method: 提出一种简单有效的训练策略，利用连续视频帧中的时间归纳偏置来改善渗透训练，无需任何网络结构修改，可无缝集成到标准渗透训练流程中

Result: 在HandCo数据集上验证，方法将收敛速度提高了2倍以上，在训练和验证分布上都获得了更低的FID指标，同时提高了生成的多样性，优化分析显示该正则化方法减小了梯度方差

Conclusion: 利用时间归纳偏置的简单训练策略可以显著提升图像渗透模型的训练效率和性能，为解决静态图像训练的信息缺失问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D是一个用于3D CT分析的多尺度视觉语言预训练框架，通过局部和全局图像文本对齐来解决放射诊断中的漏读错误和沟通失败问题，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射诊断错误（漏读错误、注意力盲区和沟通失败）在临床实践中仍然普遍存在，特别是在3D成像中，医生需要检查数百个切片。现有3D视觉语言模型无法同时满足局部检测、全局推理和语义一致报告的需求。

Method: MedVista3D采用多尺度语义增强的视觉语言预训练框架，进行局部和全局图像文本对齐以实现细粒度表示学习。通过语言模型重写和引入放射学语义匹配库来解决报告变异性问题。

Result: MedVista3D在零样本疾病分类、报告检索和医学视觉问答任务上达到最先进性能，同时在器官分割和预后预测任务上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: MedVista3D通过联合局部-全局理解和语义感知对齐，有效解决了3D放射诊断中的关键挑战，为临床实践提供了有力的工具支持。

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

TL;DR: CaPL是一种基于因果推理的视觉粒度化文本提示学习方法，通过属性解耦和粒度学习模块，显著提升了CLIP在细粒度数据集上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP提示学习方法在细粒度数据集上表现有限，需要一种能够捕捉细微类别差异的新方法。

Method: 提出两个模块：1）属性解耦模块使用布朗桥扩散模型将视觉特征分解为共享属性和特定属性；2）粒度学习模块通过因果推理策略整合属性构建视觉粒度。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，CaPL方法显著优于最先进的提示学习方法，特别是在细粒度数据集上。

Conclusion: 通过视觉粒度化和因果推理，CaPL方法成功提升了CLIP在细粒度识别任务中的性能，为提示学习提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于事件相机的事件幸运融合框架（EGTM），利用事件相机的高时间分辨率特性来高效解决大气湍流去除问题，相比现有方法在模型大小、推理延迟和复杂度方面分别提升了710倍、214倍和224倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的湍流去除方法需要从有限帧率的同步帧中学习粗粒度的湍流动态，计算和存储效率低下。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率和稀疏异步成像机制，有望从根本上解决这一瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出了"事件幸运洞察"理论，揭示了湍流失真与事件流逆时空分布的相关性。基于此构建了EGTM框架，从显式但嘈杂的湍流事件中提取像素级可靠的湍流无关指导信息，用于时间幸运融合。

Result: 在真实世界EGTM数据集上，该方法在恢复质量方面达到最先进水平（PSNR提升0.94，SSIM提升0.08），同时模型大小、推理延迟和模型复杂度分别比现有SOTA方法提升了710倍、214倍和224倍。

Conclusion: 将事件模态引入湍流去除任务具有显著的效率优势，事件相机的高时间分辨率和稀疏成像机制为湍流去除提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba提出了一种自适应多模态特征稀疏化方法，通过事件引导的多模态稀疏化策略和跨模态聚焦融合模块，在RGB-事件检测中实现了精度和效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RGB-事件检测方法在处理两种模态的低信息区域时采用统一处理方式，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。现有token稀疏化方法使用固定数量或阈值，无法适应不同复杂度样本的信息保留需求。

Method: 提出Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS)策略，利用事件相机感知的场景变化来识别和自适应丢弃每个模态中的低信息区域；设计Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF)模块来有效捕获和整合两种模态的互补特征。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FocusMamba通过自适应协作稀疏化和高效融合互补信息，成功解决了RGB-事件检测中的计算冗余问题，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Conclusion: SalientFusion方法有效解决了CZSFR任务中的关键挑战，为食物识别领域的零样本学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the
comprehensive applications of digital humans. A complete list of the models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归方法在占用世界建模中存在效率低下、长期生成时出现时间退化以及缺乏可控性等问题，需要一种能够同时保持计算效率和高保真度的长期占用生成方法。

Method: 提出时间下一尺度预测(TENS)任务，将时间序列建模问题分解为空间尺度逐级生成和时间场景逐帧预测；设计TensFormer模型灵活管理时间因果关系和空间关系；采用整体姿态聚合策略统一建模占用和自运动。

Conclusion: OccTENS通过创新的TENS任务分解和TensFormer架构，成功解决了占用世界建模中的关键挑战，为可控、高保真、高效的长期3D场景生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督学习方法，通过视觉语言模型伪标注多视角图像来获取功能部件，结合密集对比学习建立密集功能对应关系，在不同类别物体匹配任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同类别物体匹配的挑战性场景中，物体的功能（即对其他物体的影响）可以指导对应关系的建立，因为实现特定功能的对象部件通常在形状和外观上具有相似性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型对多视角图像进行伪标注获取功能部件，然后与基于像素对应的密集对比学习相结合，将功能和空间知识蒸馏到新模型中。

Result: 构建了合成和真实评估数据集作为任务基准，实验结果表明该方法在建立密集功能对应关系方面优于现有的自监督图像表示和接地视觉语言模型基线解决方案。

Conclusion: 通过功能导向的弱监督学习范式，成功实现了跨类别物体的密集功能对应关系建立，为形状重建和机器人操作等任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

TL;DR: Attn-Adapter是一个在线少样本学习框架，通过双注意力机制增强CLIP的适应性，无需重新训练基础模型，在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型在零样本图像识别中表现出色，但在少样本场景下面临计算密集型离线微调的挑战，容易过拟合，需要更高效的适应方法。

Method: 提出双注意力机制：Memory Attn-Adapter利用支持样本细化类别嵌入，Local-Global Attn-Adapter整合局部和全局特征来丰富图像嵌入，实现动态适应。

Result: 在跨类别和跨数据集泛化方面优于最先进方法，保持高效推理能力，并能在不同CLIP骨干网络上扩展。

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter提供了一个有效的在线少样本学习解决方案，通过注意力机制实现动态适应，避免了传统微调方法的计算负担和过拟合风险。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS是一个针对长图像描述任务的参考无关评估指标，通过改进CLIP模型来强调特异性，在保持与人类判断高相关性的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标存在问题：n-gram指标无法捕捉语义正确性，RS指标计算成本高且与人类判断相关性低，LLM指标虽然相关性强但计算成本过高，不适合模型开发中的迭代使用

Method: 基于CLIP模型进行改进，引入新的目标函数来强调特异性 - 奖励正确细节并惩罚错误细节，开发出SPECS指标

Result: SPECS在相关性方面与开源LLM指标相当，但计算效率显著更高，适合在图像描述模型开发中进行迭代检查点评估

Conclusion: SPECS提供了一个实用高效的替代方案，能够在保持评估质量的同时支持模型开发过程中的快速迭代

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Motivation: 医疗领域缺乏高质量标注的多样化医学图像数据，这限制了可靠AI模型的开发。虽然自然图像的生成基础模型已有显著进展，但医学图像领域仍需要专门的解决方案。

Method: 基于潜在扩散变换器架构，在96万张胸部X光片-报告对数据集上进行预训练，开发了统一的文本、掩码和边界框引导合成框架。

Result: 通过专家评估和定量指标验证了准确的X光片合成能力，在疾病分类、检测和分割任务中使用少量训练数据即可实现性能提升，并能创建多样化患者队列以检测和缓解人口统计偏差。

Conclusion: 生成式基础模型在构建更准确、数据高效和公平的医疗AI系统中具有变革性作用，ChexGen为医疗AI发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出端到端学习的多视角视频编码框架LMVC，通过利用独立视角的运动和内容信息来增强依赖视角的压缩效率，显著优于传统MV-HEVC标准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角视频是体视频的关键数据源，但数据量巨大导致存储和传输挑战。现有深度学习视频编码主要关注单视角或立体视频，多视角场景研究不足

Method: 提出特征级视角间运动向量预测方法，利用解码的独立视角运动特征来条件化依赖视角运动编码；提出无视差的视角间上下文预测模块，从解码的独立视角内容特征预测视角间上下文；配合相应的熵模型学习视角间先验

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的LMVC框架大幅优于传统MV-HEVC标准的参考软件

Conclusion: 该框架为多视角视频编码领域建立了强有力的基准，支持随机访问和向后兼容性，同时提升压缩效率

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt是一个用于3D细粒度管状结构拓扑优化的框架，通过整体建模、拓扑完整性约束和课程精炼方案，显著改善了医学管状解剖结构的几何和拓扑重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖体素重叠度量，无法保证拓扑正确性和完整性，且拓扑感知损失通常只能局部应用，无法保证全局拓扑保持和几何错误校正。

Method: 采用整体区域建模策略捕获完整空间上下文；引入拓扑完整性Betti约束联合执行Betti数先验和全局完整性；使用持久同调课程精炼方案从粗到细逐步校正错误。

Result: 在肺气道和Willis环数据集上，β₀错误分别从69.00降至3.40和从1.65降至0.30，树长度检测和分支检测率提升近10%。

Conclusion: TopoSculpt能有效校正关键拓扑错误，推进复杂3D管状解剖结构的高保真建模，在几何和拓扑方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

Method: 提出了一个自动化深度学习流水线，使用U-Net网络结构配合EfficientNet-B4编码器进行气胸区域分割，基于SIIM-ACR数据集训练，使用数据增广和二元交叉炼加Dice损失函数

Result: 在独立的PTX-498数据集上，模型达到了IoU 0.7008和Dice指数0.8241的高分，显示出良好的分割准确性

Conclusion: 该深度学习模型能够准确定位气胸病变区域，为攻式医生提供有效的诊断支持，有助于提高气胸诊断的准确性和效率

life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning

*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过多模态大语言模型构建自适应性负面文本空间(ANTS)，提升距离分布(OOD)检测性能，特别是近距离分布检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法构建负面标签时对OOD图像理解不深入，存在假阵性负面标签问题，影响近距离分布检测性能

Method: 利用MLLMs的理解和推理能力：1)识别OOD样本并生成表达性负面句子提升远距离检测 2)为视觉相似的ID类别生成负面标签减少假阳性 3)设计自适应权重分数平衡两种负面空间

Result: 在ImageNet基准上FPR95持续降低4.2%，创造新的SOTA结果，方法无需训练且零样本，具有高扩展性

Conclusion: ANTS方法通过MLLMs的理解能力构建准确的负面空间，有效解决了近距离分布检测的挑战，为OOD检测领域提供了一种高适应性、可扩展的新方案

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法仅依赖图像模态，在特征表示、变化模式建模和泛化能力方面存在局限，特别是在光照和噪声干扰下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MMChange方法：1）图像特征精炼模块突出关键区域并抑制环境噪声；2）使用视觉语言模型生成双时相图像的语义描述；3）文本差异增强模块捕捉细粒度语义变化；4）图像-文本特征融合模块实现深度跨模态集成。

Result: 在LEVIRCD、WHUCD和SYSUCD数据集上的大量实验表明，MMChange在多个指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMChange通过多模态融合有效解决了遥感变化检测中的语义限制和噪声干扰问题，验证了多模态方法在该领域的有效性。

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WSI分类方法在处理空间位置信息和序列长度外推问题上存在不足，Transformer方法需要定制CUDA内核且复杂度高，需要一种更高效且易于部署的解决方案。

Method: 1. 位置编码模块：利用实例坐标而非序列索引编码空间关系，解决训练和测试序列长度不同的外推问题；2. SAC块：基于MLP的方法，以线性时间复杂度执行全实例相关性计算，无需定制CUDA内核。

Result: 在CAMELYON-16、TCGA-LUNG和TCGA-BRAC数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAC-MIL通过空间感知的位置编码和高效的MLP-based相关性计算，为WSI分类提供了一种性能优越且易于部署的解决方案，解决了现有方法在空间信息处理和计算效率方面的局限性。

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 即使仅在训练时可用，辅助信息成像模态也能增强专家标注效果，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在多项选择题回答中的提示词设计缺乏系统研究，模型评估存在不公平性，因为最佳性能往往通过精心选择的提示词获得。

Method: 提出了Promptception系统评估框架，包含61种提示类型、15个类别和6个超类别，用于评估10个不同规模的LMM模型在3个MCQA基准测试上的表现。

Result: 专有模型对提示词语义更敏感，开源模型表现更稳定但难以处理复杂提示；提示词变化可导致高达15%的准确率差异。

Conclusion: 需要针对专有和开源模型制定不同的提示原则，以实现更稳健和公平的模型评估。

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

Motivation: 现有3D语义占据预测方法在处理体素特征时忽视了高度轴信息，传统通道注意力机制对所有高度层赋予相同权重，无法有效强调不同高度的特征。

Method: 提出SliceSemOcc框架：1）使用全局和局部垂直切片提取高度轴体素特征；2）全局局部融合模块协调细粒度空间细节和整体上下文信息；3）SEAttention3D模块通过平均池化保持高度分辨率，为每个高度层分配动态通道注意力权重。

Result: 在nuScenes-SurroundOcc和nuScenes-OpenOccupancy数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提高了平均IoU，特别是在大多数小物体类别上取得了明显增益。

Conclusion: 详细的消融研究验证了SliceSemOcc框架的有效性，该方法通过更好的高度轴特征处理提升了3D语义占据预测性能。

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于飞腾处理器和寒武纪加速卡的异构计算架构，构建毫秒级响应的无人机跟踪凝视系统，实现50-100ms处理延迟和98.5%识别精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄像头系统在动态场景中响应延迟超过200ms，无法满足复杂场景实时需求，主要由于自动识别算法的深度特征提取能力不足和计算架构效率瓶颈

Method: 硬件采用飞腾FT-2000/4处理器与MLU220加速卡协同计算架构，软件集成轻量化YOLOv5s检测网络与DeepSORT级联跟踪算法，形成"检测-跟踪-反馈"闭环控制链

Result: 系统在1920*1080分辨率视频流处理中实现50-100ms稳定单帧综合处理延迟，多尺度目标识别精度超过98.5%，兼具低延迟和高精度特性

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机监控和国产芯片应用提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

TL;DR: 一种基于多视角特征聚合的高效人员重识别重排名方法，通过K近邻加权融合生成多视角特征，显著提升了几个挑战性数据集的绩效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单视图像特征导致的视角偏差问题，如姿势变化、视点变化和遮挡等，通过多视角特征来减少视角偏差

Method: 使用K近邻加权融合(KWF)方法聚合邻居特征来生成多视角特征，在无监督方式下选择K个相似特征，并研究了特征聚合中的权重选择策略

Result: 在Market1501、MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC数据集上显著提升了Rank@1和mAP指标，特别是在MSMT17和Occluded-DukeMTMC上分别获得9.8%和22.0%的Rank@1提升，同时计算效率也显著提高

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型微调或额外标注，适用于大规模数据集，通过多视角特征聚合有效减少了视角偏差，在保持高效计算的同时显著提升了重识别精度

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

TL;DR: 通过双向文本融合模块和类别感知时间图模块，解决音视频解析中假标签噫音传播问题，实现了SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音视频解析方法存在两类问题：一类将噫音段落级假标签视为可靠监督，另一类让无区别关注技术将假标签扩散到所有帧，导致初始错误在训练中被放大

Method: 结合双向文本融合(BiT)模块和类别感知时间图(CATS)模块。BiT模块通过语义注入和动态检查定位和净化清洁丰富的语义线索，CATS模块进行语义传播和连接以实现精确的语义信息传播

Result: 在LLP和UnAV-100两个标准数据集上多个关键指标达到了最先进的SOTA性能

Conclusion: 通过整合两种研究方向的优势和互补性，成功解决了音视频解析中假标签噫音传播问题，提供了更准确的事件识别方案

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion是一个新的文本到故事可视化框架，通过迭代过程生成多角色故事，保持角色一致性并通过后处理准确分配对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到故事可视化方法在角色一致性和对话渲染方面存在困难，导致伪影生成和不连贯的叙事。

Method: 使用预训练LLM生成每帧描述、角色细节和对话，采用有界注意力掩码技术控制角色交互，应用身份一致自注意力机制确保跨帧角色一致性，以及区域感知交叉注意力进行精确对象放置。

Result: 实验结果表明，TaleDiffusion在一致性、降噪和对话渲染方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion通过创新的注意力机制和后处理技术，有效解决了多角色故事可视化中的一致性和对话分配问题。

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂多元素提示词和有限风格多样性方面的困难。

Method: 包含两个核心组件：1)位置-风格感知模块，使用微调LLM分解提示词为空间坐标和风格语义指令；2)多专家扩散模块，通过动态专家路由实现跨区域生成，使用注意力门控机制选择专家模型。

Result: 实验表明MEPG在图像质量和风格多样性方面显著优于相同骨干网络的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架支持轻量级集成和替换专家模型，提供强大的可扩展性，并支持实时空间布局编辑和区域风格选择。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Conclusion: 简单的预训练模型精细调优可以实现高性能深度伪造检测，在准确性、计算成本和可解释性之间取得平衡，具备实际部署价值

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Conclusion: 多重YOLO架构结合融合多光谱数据提供更可靠的解决方案，显著改善了可见光和热成像缺陷的检测能力

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注工具需要大量人工输入，难以扩展到大型数据集，需要开发自动化工具来提升标注效率和可扩展性。

Method: 结合CLIP、Ultralytics预训练检测器和Grounding DINO零样本模型，采用低置信度阈值最大化召回率，通过交互式工具进行标注精炼，并利用WebGPU加速的Segment Anything实现实时分割。

Conclusion: VisioFirm通过AI辅助自动化显著提升了图像标注效率，支持多种标注类型和导出格式，为大规模数据集标注提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

Motivation: 现有UCIR方法在整个图像上对齐跨域特征时，由于对象特征与域特定风格纠缠，难以处理域差距问题

Method: 利用文本到图像生成模型进行特征解缠，分离对象特征和域特定风格；通过渐进式对齐域内和跨域的互近邻来实现可靠的特征对齐

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的13个域中实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DUDE通过特征解缠和渐进式对齐方法有效解决了跨域图像检索中的域差距问题，取得了优异的检索性能

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要密集多视角观测和真实相机位姿的问题，在更弱的输入假设下学习准确的铰接物体表示

Method: 首先使用稀疏视图3D重建独立重建每个铰接状态，然后学习跨姿态的密集对应变形场，采用渐进式解耦策略分离静态和运动部件，最后通过自监督损失联合优化几何、外观和运动学

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界示例上的实验表明，该方法在比现有方法显著更弱的输入假设下产生准确详细的铰接物体表示

Conclusion: 该框架能够在稀疏视图和无相机监督条件下有效学习铰接物体的表示，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像地理定位评估存在两个主要问题：1）数据泄露 - 大型视觉语言模型常在测试数据集上预训练，影响评估准确性；2）现有指标过度依赖精确坐标，忽视推理过程且存在隐私风险。

Method: 开发GeoArena平台，允许用户上传真实野外图像构建多样化评估语料库，利用成对人类判断来确定模型输出与人类期望的匹配程度。

Result: 平台上线两个月收集了数千条投票记录，基于这些数据进行了详细分析，并建立了不同LVLM在图像地理定位任务上的排行榜。

Conclusion: GeoArena提供了一个真实野外和人类中心化的基准测试平台，有效解决了当前图像地理定位评估中的关键问题，为模型性能评估提供了更可靠的框架。

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

TL;DR: FE2E框架首次将基于DiT架构的图像编辑模型用于密集几何预测，通过改进训练目标和量化策略，在零样本深度和法线估计任务上取得了显著性能提升，甚至超越了使用100倍训练数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集预测本质上是图像到图像的任务，而图像编辑模型（而非文本到图像生成模型）可能更适合作为微调的基础。研究发现编辑模型具有内在的结构先验，能够更稳定地收敛并获得更高性能。

Method: 提出FE2E框架，将基于DiT架构的编辑模型适配于密集几何预测。改进训练目标为"一致速度"训练，使用对数量化解决精度冲突，并利用DiT的全局注意力实现深度和法线的联合估计。

Result: 在不增加训练数据的情况下，FE2E在多个数据集的零样本单目深度和法线估计上取得显著性能提升，在ETH3D数据集上获得超过35%的性能增益，超越了使用100倍训练数据的DepthAnything系列。

Conclusion: 图像编辑模型比生成模型更适合密集几何预测任务，FE2E框架通过有效的适配策略展示了编辑模型在这一领域的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Motivation: 动态面部表情识别面临长尾类别分布和复杂时空特征建模的挑战，现有深度学习方法存在模型归纳偏差问题，无法有效解决这些限制。

Method: 提出MICACL框架，包含：1）图增强实例交互模块（GEIIM）通过自适应邻接矩阵和多尺度卷积捕获相邻实例间的复杂时空关系；2）加权实例聚合网络（WIAN）基于实例重要性动态分配权重；3）多尺度类别感知对比学习（MCCL）策略平衡主要和次要类别的训练。

Conclusion: MICACL框架通过整合时空依赖建模和长尾对比学习优化，有效解决了动态面部表情识别中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes

leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM成功将LMMs应用于人员异常搜索任务，证明了其在细粒度异常检索中的有效性，为未来研究提供了有价值的框架和基准。

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM是首个专门为美学图像描述任务将图像美学显著性整合到多模态大语言模型中的框架，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的3D风格转移流水线能够生成更结构化、视觉一致且艺术性更强的风格化结果，有效解决了现有方法在高级风格语义提取和实例区分方面的限制

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

Method: 提出PtyINR框架，将物体和探针参数化为连续神经表示，直接从原始衍射图样进行端到端重建，无需探针预表征

Result: 在仿真和实验数据上均实现卓越的重建质量，在挑战性低信号条件下表现出显著鲁棒性

Conclusion: PtyINR提供了一个通用、物理信息化的框架，适用于解决各种探针依赖的逆问题，可广泛应用于计算显微镜领域

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UCF-UM框架，通过循环评估协议量化统一视觉语言模型在图像理解和生成之间的语义漂移，揭示了现有单次评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法单独考察图像理解和生成能力，无法揭示模型在跨模态循环转换中的语义一致性，需要新的评估框架来量化语义漂移。

Method: 设计循环评估协议，交替进行I2T和T2I多代转换，提出三个指标：MCD（平均累积漂移）、SDR（语义漂移率）和MGG（多代GenEval）。创建ND400新基准数据集。

Result: 发现不同模型在跨模态稳定性上存在显著差异，有些模型能保持语义一致性，而有些模型尽管单次评估表现良好但语义漂移很快。

Conclusion: 循环一致性评估是标准I2T和T2I评估的必要补充，提供了评估统一模型跨模态稳定性和共享表示强度的实用指标。

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

TL;DR: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过速度匹配和速度蒸馏实现3D流模型的少步蒸馏，将采样步骤从25步减少到1-2步，实现6.5-9倍加速，同时保持高质量生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流式3D生成模型需要大量采样步骤，一致性模型等少步蒸馏方法在2D领域已有进展，但在更复杂的3D生成任务中仍待探索。

Method: 提出MDT-dist框架，通过Velocity Matching学习师生模型间的速度场匹配，以及Velocity Distillation利用学习到的速度场进行概率密度蒸馏，将边际数据传输目标转化为可优化的目标。

Result: 在TRELLIS框架上，将每个流变换器的采样步骤从25步减少到1-2步，实现0.68s（1步×2）和0.94s（2步×2）的延迟，在A800上分别获得9.0倍和6.5倍加速，同时保持高视觉和几何保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有的CM蒸馏方法，使TRELLIS在少步3D生成中达到优越性能，为3D生成模型的实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在肖像动画视频生成中难以实现高保真、空间一致的属性迁移问题，特别是在零样本设置下处理多样化属性和野外参考组合的挑战。

Method: 采用双参考网络将肖像和属性图像的空间特征注入扩散模型去噪过程；使用自重建公式训练，通过掩码扩展策略和空间/外观级变换增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在肖像动画属性迁移任务上达到最先进性能，双参考设计支持单次生成过程中多属性组合，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: Durian通过创新的双参考网络架构和训练策略，成功实现了零样本肖像动画的高质量属性迁移，为多属性组合生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

Motivation: X光影像中的准直器阴影检测对于限制疾病医生和患者的放射暴露至关重要，但散射光线会遮蔽边缘，需要更精确的检测方法

Method: 提出一种基于深度学习的分割方法，统一使用可微哈夫变换网络检测准直器边界，并提取ROI中心信息，在推理时结合两个任务的信息生成精细的线约束分割面具

Result: 在多样化的真实X光影像测试集上实现了稳健的准直区域重建，达到了中位洋哈多夫距离4.3-5.0mm

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测X光影像中的准直器阴影，虽然应用中最多只涉及四个边缘，但方法本质上不受特定边数的限制

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

Motivation: 因全景图像(ODIs)在虚拟现实、自主驾驶等领域的需求增长，但其与透视图像在几何投影、空间分布和边界连续性上存在显著差异，直接域适配面临挑战。

Method: 首先回顾全景成像流程和投影方法，分析结构差异，总结了三大域适配挑战：极点附近的严重几何扭曲、等矩投影中的非均匀采样、周期性边界连续性。然后从两个维度分析了20+代表性任务。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了数据、模型和应用方面的开放挑战和未来方向，为全景视觉研究的发展提供了新的见解和前瞻性观点，有助于推动全景视觉技术的进步。

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

Method: 提出了Plot'n Polish零样本框架，能够在不同细节级别上对故事可视化进行细粒度控制，实现一致的故事生成。

Result: 该框架能够提供灵活的编辑能力，同时保持跨多帧的视觉和叙事一致性，解决了创作者在制作和精修视觉故事时面临的关键挑战。

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish为解决故事可视化中的一致性和控制问题提供了一个有效的零样本解决方案，为创意领域的实际应用提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

Conclusion: 联合训练不同扭曲类型有助于知识共享并增强模型的泛化能力，TRUST-VL为多模态虚假信息检测提供了一个有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

Conclusion: 使用现成的企业软件工具可以实现显著的软件加速，无需编写特定的HPC代码，为图分析工作负载提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: The HPEC Graph Challenge is a collection of benchmarks representing complex
workloads that test the hardware and software components of HPC systems, which
traditional benchmarks, such as LINPACK, do not. The first benchmark, Subgraph
Isomorphism, focused on several compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. The
most recent of the challenges, the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge,
represents a shift in direction, as it represents a longer end-to-end workload
that requires many more software components, including, but not limited to,
data I/O, data structures for representing graph data, and a wide range of
functions for data preparation and network analysis. A notable feature of this
new graph challenge is the use of GraphBLAS to represent the computational
aspects of the problem statement. In this paper, we show an alternative
interpretation of the GraphBLAS formulations using the language of data
science. With this formulation, we show that the new graph challenge can be
implemented using off-the-shelf ETL tools available in open-source, enterprise
software such as NVIDIA's RAPIDS ecosystem. Using off-the-shelf software,
RAPIDS cuDF and cupy, we enable significant software acceleration without
requiring any specific HPC code and show speedups, over the same code running
with Pandas on the CPU, of 147x-509x on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, 243x-1269X for an
NVIDIA H100 GPU, and 332X-2185X for an NVIDIA H200 GPU.

Abstract: The distributedData Retrieval (DR) model consists of $k$ peers connected by a
complete peer-to-peer communication network, and a trusted external data source
that stores an array $\textbf{X}$ of $n$ bits ($n \gg k$). Up to $\beta k$ of
the peers might fail in any execution (for $\beta \in [0, 1)$). Peers can
obtain the information either by inexpensive messages passed among themselves
or through expensive queries to the source array $\textbf{X}$. In the DR model,
we focus on designing protocols that minimize the number of queries performed
by any nonfaulty peer (a measure referred to as query complexity) while
maximizing the resilience parameter $\beta$.
  The Download problem requires each nonfaulty peer to correctly learn the
entire array $\textbf{X}$. Earlier work on this problem focused on synchronous
communication networks and established several deterministic and randomized
upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to extend the study of
distributed data retrieval to asynchronous communication networks. We address
the Download problem under both the Byzantine and crash failure models. We
present query-optimal deterministic solutions in an asynchronous model that can
tolerate any fixed fraction $\beta<1$ of crash faults. In the Byzantine failure
model, it is known that deterministic protocols incur a query complexity of
$\Omega(n)$ per peer, even under synchrony. We extend this lower bound to
randomized protocols in the asynchronous model for $\beta \geq 1/2$, and
further show that for $\beta < 1/2$, a randomized protocol exists with
near-optimal query complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to address the Download problem in asynchronous communication networks.

Result: 成功解决了在π-可见性模型下的机器人聚集问题，突破了之前研究中需要刚性移动的限制

Conclusion: 该算法证明了在有限可见性和通信能力条件下，即使采用非刚性移动和完全异步调度，也能实现机器人的有效聚集

Abstract: This work addresses the gathering problem for a set of autonomous, anonymous,
and homogeneous robots with limited visibility operating in a continuous
circle. The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a
rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise
direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots
on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna
\textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is
impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$
visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$
visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is
removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a
gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory
($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.
  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be
done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous
scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one
point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots
had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite
communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$). In this work the robot movement is
non-rigid and the robots work under a fully asynchronous scheduler.

Abstract: We consider large-scale systems influenced by burnout variables - state
variables that start active, shape dynamics, and irreversibly deactivate once
certain conditions are met. Simulating what-if scenarios in such systems is
computationally demanding, as alternative trajectories often require sequential
processing, which does not scale very well. This challenge arises in settings
like online advertising, because of campaigns budgets, complicating
counterfactual analysis despite rich data availability. We introduce a new type
of algorithms based on what we refer to as uncertainty relaxation, that enables
efficient parallel computation, significantly improving scalability for
counterfactual estimation in systems with burnout variables.

Method: 提出LowDiff框架：1）重用压缩梯度作为差异检查点；2）批量梯度写入优化；3）动态调整检查点频率和批量大小；4）分层梯度重用和快照方法；5）基于CPU的异步持久化策略。

Result: 在各种工作负载上的实验表明，LowDiff可以实现每迭代的检查点频率，运行时开销小于3.1%。

Conclusion: LowDiff通过梯度重用和优化技术，实现了高效的频繁检查点，显著降低了分布式训练中的检查点成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures,
so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies
focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it
generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading
training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to
reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application
to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.
  This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework
that \textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints
to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write
optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also
dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to
maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient
reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence
strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression.
Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing
frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\% runtime overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OBLOT模型中机器人能力有限（匿名、无方向感、无记忆、无声），算法设计具有挑战性。现有研究主要关注移动次数和轮次成本，但忽略了计算能力的影响

Method: 利用同步机器人在有限图上的无限计算能力，开发了一个确定性的解析算法

Result: 该算法能够解决广泛类别的问题，同时保证最小的移动次数和轮次

Conclusion: 在OBLOT模型中，无限计算能力对同步机器人的性能有重要影响，可以设计出移动和轮次最优的算法

Abstract: The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics.
It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are
anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their
only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning,
i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of
distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous
research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished
within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed
computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is
neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the
number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove
that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited
computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact,
by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to
a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and
rounds.

TL;DR: 分析了量子纠缠纯化协议在IP网络通信延迟下的实际可行性，确定了成功与失败的边界条件，并提供了部署纯化协议所需的延迟预算、内存质量目标和资源开销估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子网络中纠缠对在存储期间会因环境退相干而降低保真度，纠缠纯化可以恢复保真度，但经典通信延迟导致的空闲时间会使量子态暴露在进一步的退相干中。

Method: 使用微观Lindblad方法处理量子动力学，基于当前城域IP网络延迟统计和量子内存测试台参数，对BBPSSW和DEJMPS协议在各种网络条件下进行综合性能评估。

Result: 确定了纠缠纯化成功与失败的相空间边界（保真度平衡等值线），计算了完成多轮纯化协议所需的总纠缠对数量，以及超过应用特定阈值的纯化保真度纠缠对的稳态吞吐量。

Conclusion: 为在当前和近未来网络上部署纠缠纯化提供了具体的延迟预算、内存质量目标和资源开销估计，明确了协议可行的操作区域。

Abstract: Quantum networks rely on high fidelity entangled pairs distributed to nodes,
but maintaining their fidelity is challenged by environmental decoherence
during storage. Entanglement purification is used to restore fidelity, but the
idle periods imposed by the associated classical communication delays
counteract this goal by exposing the states to further decoherence. In this
work, we analyze the practical viability of entanglement purification protocols
(BBPSSW, DEJMPS), under non-instantaneous classical coordination over Internet
protocol (IP) communications networks. We present a comprehensive performance
evaluation of these protocols in various network conditions for a range of
quantum memory technologies. We employ a microscopic Lindblad treatment of the
underlying quantum dynamics, and use current-generation metropolitan IP network
latency statistics and parameters drawn from quantum memory testbeds. In doing
so we identify the regions in which entanglement purification succeeds and
fails, delineated by break-even iso-fidelity contours in the phase space. We
then determine the total number of entangled pairs required to complete a
multi-round purification protocol, and the steady-state throughput of entangled
pairs with purified fidelities that exceed application-specific thresholds.
This provides latency budgets, memory quality targets, and resource-overhead
estimates for deploying purification on current and near-future networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决队列网络中边传输成本未知情况下的路由调度问题，传统老虎机方法无法直接应用，因为需要考虑队列动态和网络稳定性要求。

Method: 结合Lyapunov漂移加惩罚优化技术和多臂老虎机方法，开发网络控制策略，同时优化吞吐量和成本。

Result: 理论证明该策略相比完全了解到达和成本的最优策略，实现了O(√T log T)的次线性遗憾。仿真验证了遗憾的次线性特性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了队列网络中未知成本的路由调度问题，在保证网络稳定性的同时实现了接近最优的性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks,
where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network
controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those
edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to
make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is
minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off,
however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this
problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the
network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We
show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static
optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques
from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show
that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as
compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs.
Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its
regret is indeed sub-linear.

Motivation: 传统的群众打包方法在农村地区效果差，人口密度低、地形复杂，而无人机测量可以避免时间粒度大、劳动密集和危险性问题。

Method: 开发了一种基于无人机的平台，集成机载计算单元和商业移动调制解调器，通过空中操作收集RAN信号和端到端网络性能指标，使用地理空间映射和统计技术进行数据分析和可视化。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着高度升高，收到信号功率提升（视线条件改善），但信号质量下降（邻小区干扰增加）。在大部分测试区域，系统保持了可接受的信号质量、充足的上下行吞吐量和满意的往返延迟特性。强时信号并不能保证测试区域内的一致性覆盖。

Conclusion: 无人机基网络测量平台有效解决了农村地区网络性能评估难题，但高空低干扰和信号质量下降是需要关注的问题，且信号强度不能作为覆盖均匀性的唯一指标。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a measurement platform to capture mobile network
performance metrics including coverage and quality of service in regions where
conventional coverage testing approaches are frequently time-intensive,
labor-demanding, and occasionally hazardous. Traditionally, crowd-sourcing
methods are used to collect cellular network performance metrics. However,
these approaches are inadequate in rural areas due to low-density population,
and difficult terrain. The platform described here is a UAV-based and is
designed to investigate the mobile network performance through aerial
operations and gather Radio Access Network (RAN) signal alongside end-to-end
network performance metrics. Our platform gathers metrics through the
integration of an onboard computation unit and commercial off-the-shelf
cellular modem. The gathered data are subsequently analyzed and displayed using
geospatial mapping utilities and statistical techniques to deliver key
observations on cellular network performance. Experimental results showed that
the received signal power improves at higher altitudes due to enhanced
line-of-sight (LoS) conditions as expected. However, the signal quality
degrades as a result of increased interference from neighboring cells. The
analysis reveals that for most of the geographic area covered in the initial
experiments the system maintained acceptable signal quality, with adequate
throughput performance for both uplink and downlink communications, while
maintaining satisfactory round-trip time characteristics. Notably, the
experiment showed that a strong radio signal metric for a given cell does not
necessarily translate to consistent spatial coverage across the tested region.

Abstract: Indoor positioning is an enabling technology for home, office, and industrial
network users because it provides numerous information and communication
technology (ICT) and Internet of things (IoT) functionalities such as indoor
navigation, smart meter localization, asset tracking, support for emergency
services, and detection of hazardous situations. The IEEE 802.11mc fine timing
measurement (FTM) protocol (commercially known as Wi-Fi Location) has great
potential to enable indoor positioning in future generation devices, primarily
because of the high availability of Wi-Fi networks, FTM's high accuracy and
device support. Furthermore, new FTM enhancements are available in the released
(802.11az) and recently completed (802.11bk) amendments. Despite the multitude
of literature reviews on indoor positioning, a survey dedicated to FTM and its
recent enhancements has so far been lacking. We fill this gap by classifying
and reviewing over 180 research papers related to the practical accuracy
achieved with FTM, methods for improving its accuracy (also with machine
learning), combining FTM with other indoor positioning systems, FTM-based
applications, and security issues. Based on the conducted survey, we summarize
the most important research achievements and formulate open areas for further
research.

Abstract: This work considers a parallel task execution strategy in vehicular edge
computing (VEC) networks, where edge servers are deployed along the roadside to
process offloaded computational tasks of vehicular users. To minimize the
overall waiting delay among vehicular users, a novel task offloading solution
is implemented based on the network cooperation balancing resource
under-utilization and load congestion. Dual evaluation through theoretical and
numerical ways shows that the developed solution achieves a globally optimal
delay reduction performance compared to existing methods, which is also
approved by the feasibility test over a real-map virtual environment. The
in-depth analysis reveals that predicting the instantaneous processing power of
edge servers facilitates the identification of overloaded servers, which is
critical for determining network delay. By considering discrete variables of
the queue, the proposed technique's precise estimation can effectively address
these combinatorial challenges to achieve optimal performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种统一方案，结合了区域系统、所有权类型和可达性类型的优点，在高阶函数式语言中实现静态资源管理和业命期控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高阶函数式语言中静态资源管理的挑战，统一区域系统的词法作用域生命期、Rust所有权类型的非词法作用域生命期以及可达性类型的共享推理能力，充分利用各种方法的优势。

Method: 在可达性类型[Wei et al. 2024]基础上提出两个新扩展：A<:采用新题的二维存储模型支持业内任意共享资源的粗粒度可达性跟踪；{A}<:实现词法作用域生命期控制和静态安全保证。两个计算系统都在Rocq中形式化并证明类型安全。

Result: 设计的方案允许将资源分组为业以支持任意共享和词法作用域生命期静态保证，同时也支持个体资源管理和非词法作用域生命期。所有资源共享同一类型，保持了语言的高阶参数化性质。

Conclusion: 该工作成功统一了不同资源管理方法的优点，通过可达性类型扩展实现了灵活的共享模式和生命期控制，为高阶函数式语言提供了新的静态资源管理方案。

Abstract: Static resource management in higher-order functional languages remains
elusive due to tensions between control, expressiveness, and flexibility.
Region-based systems [Grossman et al. 2002; Tofte et al. 2001] offer control
over lifetimes and expressive in-region sharing, but restrict resources to
lexical scopes. Rust, an instance of ownership types [Clarke et al. 2013],
offers non-lexical lifetimes and robust safety guarantees, yet its global
invariants make common sharing patterns hard to express. Reachability types
[Wei et al. 2024] enable reasoning about sharing and separation, but lack
practical tools for controlling resource lifetimes.
  In this work, we try to unify their strengths. Our solution enables grouping
resources as arenas for arbitrary sharing and static guarantees of lexically
scoped lifetimes. Crucially, arenas and lexical lifetimes are not the only
choice: users may also manage resources individually, with non-lexical
lifetimes. Regardless of mode, resources share the same type, preserving the
higher-order parametric nature of the language.
  Obtaining static safety guarantee in a higher-order language with flexible
sharing is nontrivial. To this end, we propose two new extensions atop
reachability types [Wei et al. 2024]. First, A<: features a novel
two-dimensional store model to enable coarse-grained reachability tracking for
arbitrarily shared resources within arenas. Building on this, {A}<: establishes
lexical lifetime control with static guarantees. As the first reachability
formalism presented for lifetime control, {A}<: avoids the complication of
flow-sensitive reasoning and retains expressive power and simplicity. Both
calculi are formalized and proven type safe in Rocq.

Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable
donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper
presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a
web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a
centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register
their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and
availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location,
and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The
platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams
to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web
technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and
MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a
dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor
refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces
delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood
and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.

Abstract: Functional verification and debugging are critical bottlenecks in modern
System-on-Chip (SoC) design, with manual detection of Advanced Peripheral Bus
(APB) transaction errors in large Value Change Dump (VCD) files being
inefficient and error-prone. Addressing the 2025 ICCAD Contest Problem D, this
study proposes an automated error diagnosis framework using a hierarchical
Random Forest-based architecture. The multi-stage error diagnosis employs four
pre-trained binary classifiers to sequentially detect Out-of-Range Access,
Address Corruption, and Data Corruption errors, prioritizing high-certainty
address-related faults before tackling complex data errors to enhance
efficiency. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 91.36%, with
near-perfect precision and recall for address errors and robust performance for
data errors. Although the final results of the ICCAD 2025 CAD Contest are yet
to be announced as of the submission date, our team achieved first place in the
beta stage, highlighting the method's competitive strength. This research
validates the potential of hierarchical machine learning as a powerful

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新算法，能够跟踪编程过程中的抽象语法树节点变化，从而在大规模上分析学生编程行为的新维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的编程过程数据分析主要基于高级统计指标（如时间、删除率等），而在上下文中分析行为（如学生在循环中花费的时间）因无法自动跟踪高级代码表示而变得繁琐。

Method: 设计了两个算法来跟踪抽象语法树节点的时间变化，并为无法解析的代码状态构建树表示。应用这些算法分析了2021年CS1课程的学生键盘输入数据。

Result: 发现了多个新的可观测统计：条件语句和循环内外的代码删除率相似；三分之一的注释掉的代码最终会恢复；学生在代码中跳转的频率可能不代表困难。

Conclusion: 跟踪抽象语法树的能力为理解学生编程的新维度打开了大门，包括代码结构发展的最佳实践、语法构造困难度量化、重构行为和代码内注意力转移等。

Abstract: Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to
understand the processes students use to write computer programming
assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in
various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings,
character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much
time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our
inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as
abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states.
  Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first
algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this
algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual
tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student
programming behavior that can now be done at scale.
  Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree
nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code
states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student
coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse
trees.
  Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that
code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops,
a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with
which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle.
  Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to
understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of
structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what
syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and
attention shifting within the code.

### [178] [Towards an Understanding of Developer Experience-Driven Transparency in Software Ecosystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03848)
*Rodrigo Oliveira Zacarias,Rodrigo Pereira dos Santos,Patricia Lago*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了SECO-TransDX概念模型，从开发者体验角度系统化定义软件生态系统透明度，包含63个相关概念，为研究和实践提供结构化分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件生态系统中透明度对开发者体验至关重要但研究不足，现有研究承认透明度对信任、公平和参与的重要性，但其与开发者体验的关系尚未系统化概念化。

Method: 基于先前研究构建概念模型，并通过德尔菲研究法（Delphi study）与学术界和工业界专家进行完善，提出了SECO-TransDX模型。

Result: 开发了包含63个相互关联概念的概念模型，涵盖条件因素、生态系统程序、工件和关系动态等维度，提供了从技术、社会和组织层面分析透明度如何调节开发者体验的结构化视角。

Conclusion: SECO-TransDX模型为未来研究和工具开发奠定基础，支持设计可信赖的开发者中心平台，提高透明度并促进软件生态系统的长期参与。

Abstract: Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software
industry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through
complementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is
increasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains
an underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with
ecosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,
fairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been
systematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the
understanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To
this end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a
Developer Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the
notion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated
concepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and
relational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and
constructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior
research and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and
industry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX
across technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays
the groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it
supports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve
transparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.

### [179] [VulRTex: A Reasoning-Guided Approach to Identify Vulnerabilities from Rich-Text Issue Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03875)
*Ziyou Jiang,Mingyang Li,Guowei Yang,Lin Shi,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VulRTex是一个基于大语言模型推理能力的漏洞相关issue报告识别方法，通过利用富文本信息和历史数据构建推理数据库，在数据不平衡情况下表现优异，比最佳基线方法F1提升11.0%，时间成本降低2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的漏洞相关issue报告识别方法主要关注文本描述，缺乏对富文本信息的综合分析，安全从业者需要花费大量时间手动识别，时间差可能被攻击者利用。

Method: VulRTex首先利用LLM的推理能力构建漏洞推理数据库，然后检索相关案例生成推理指导，指导LLM对目标IR的富文本信息进行推理分析来识别漏洞。

Result: 在973,572个IRs上的实验显示，VulRTex在识别漏洞相关IRs和预测CWE-ID方面表现最佳，F1提升11.0%，AUPRC提升20.2%，Macro-F1提升10.5%，时间成本比基线推理方法低2倍。成功识别了2024年GitHub IRs中10个代表性OSS项目的30个新兴漏洞，其中11个被分配了CVE-ID。

Conclusion: VulRTex通过利用LLM的推理能力和富文本信息，有效解决了漏洞相关issue报告的自动识别问题，具有很好的实用性和性能优势。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities exist in open-source software (OSS), and the
developers who discover these vulnerabilities may submit issue reports (IRs) to
describe their details. Security practitioners need to spend a lot of time
manually identifying vulnerability-related IRs from the community, and the time
gap may be exploited by attackers to harm the system. Previously, researchers
have proposed automatic approaches to facilitate identifying these
vulnerability-related IRs, but these works focus on textual descriptions but
lack the comprehensive analysis of IR's rich-text information. In this paper,
we propose VulRTex, a reasoning-guided approach to identify
vulnerability-related IRs with their rich-text information. In particular,
VulRTex first utilizes the reasoning ability of the Large Language Model (LLM)
to prepare the Vulnerability Reasoning Database with historical IRs. Then, it
retrieves the relevant cases from the prepared reasoning database to generate
reasoning guidance, which guides LLM to identify vulnerabilities by reasoning
analysis on target IRs' rich-text information. To evaluate the performance of
VulRTex, we conduct experiments on 973,572 IRs, and the results show that
VulRTex achieves the highest performance in identifying the
vulnerability-related IRs and predicting CWE-IDs when the dataset is
imbalanced, outperforming the best baseline with +11.0% F1, +20.2% AUPRC, and
+10.5% Macro-F1, and 2x lower time cost than baseline reasoning approaches.
Furthermore, VulRTex has been applied to identify 30 emerging vulnerabilities
across 10 representative OSS projects in 2024's GitHub IRs, and 11 of them are
successfully assigned CVE-IDs, which illustrates VulRTex's practicality.

*Xingchu Chen,Chengwei Liu,Jialun Cao,Yang Xiao,Xinyue Cai,Yeting Li,Jingyi Shi,Tianqi Sun,Haiming Chen ang Wei Huo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文对12种漏洞影响版本识别工具进行了首次全面实证研究，发现所有工具准确率均不超过45%，存在启发式依赖、语义推理有限等根本性局限性，集成策略最多只能提升10.1%准确率，凸显了需要全新方法的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有漏洞影响版本识别工具在真实环境中的有效性尚不明确，评估范围狭窄且局限于早期SZZ变体、过时技术和小规模数据集，需要进行系统性评估。

Method: 构建包含1,128个真实C/C++漏洞的高质量基准数据集，从追踪和匹配两种范式系统评估12种代表性工具，涵盖漏洞级别和版本级别的有效性、误报误诊根因分析、对补丁特性的敏感性以及集成潜力四个维度。

Result: 研究发现所有工具准确率均不超过45.0%，主要挑战来自启发式依赖、有限的语义推理和僵化的匹配逻辑。仅添加补丁和跨文件变更等补丁结构进一步影响性能。集成策略最多提升10.1%准确率，但总体准确率仍低于60.0%。

Conclusion: 现有工具存在根本性局限性，需要开发全新的方法。研究为工具开发、组合策略和未来研究提供了可操作的见解，并公开了复现代码和基准数据集以促进后续贡献。

Abstract: Identifying which software versions are affected by a vulnerability is
critical for patching, risk mitigation.Despite a growing body of tools, their
real-world effectiveness remains unclear due to narrow evaluation scopes often
limited to early SZZ variants, outdated techniques, and small or
coarse-graineddatasets. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive
empirical study of vulnerability affected versions identification. We curate a
high quality benchmark of 1,128 real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities and
systematically evaluate 12 representative tools from both tracing and matching
paradigms across four dimensions: effectiveness at both vulnerability and
version levels, root causes of false positives and negatives, sensitivity to
patch characteristics, and ensemble potential. Our findings reveal fundamental
limitations: no tool exceeds 45.0% accuracy, with key challenges stemming from
heuristic dependence, limited semantic reasoning, and rigid matching logic.
Patch structures such as add-only and cross-file changes further hinder
performance. Although ensemble strategies can improve results by up to 10.1%,
overall accuracy remains below 60.0%, highlighting the need for fundamentally
new approaches. Moreover, our study offers actionable insights to guide tool
development, combination strategies, and future research in this critical area.
Finally, we release the replicated code and benchmark on our website to
encourage future contributions.outdated techniques, and small or coarse grained
datasets.

### [181] [Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896)
*Zushuai Zhang,Elliott Wen,Ewan Tempero*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 代码异味之间的相互作用会显著增加模块间的依赖关系，导致维护复杂性和成本上升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码异味可能通过相互作用增加模块间依赖关系，了解这种现象对于减少维护复杂性至关重要

Method: 对116个开源Java系统进行依赖分析，量化代码异味相互作用的影响，并与非代码异味情况进行对比

Result: 代码异味对之间的相互作用会导致总依赖关系的增加，如Feature Envy方法与Data Classes相互作用时依赖数量从1增至7，增长7倍

Conclusion: 开发者应优先处理相互作用的代码异味，而非单独存在的代码异味，以减少模块间依赖和降低维护成本

Abstract: The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that
changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and
costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is
therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased
dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are
characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in
ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to
confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution
of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We
conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the
interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between
code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions
between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies
and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total
dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature
Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are
non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers
should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather
than code smells that exist only in isolation.

*Yuvraj Agrawal*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了Auth Shim架构模式，通过在OSS应用前部署轻量级代理服务，将企业IdP的认证协议转换为应用原生会话机制，解决了开源软件缺乏SAML/OIDC支持的安全集成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业广泛采用开源软件，但许多独立工具缺乏对SAML、OIDC等标准协议的原生支持，导致安全集成存在关键缺口，阻碍了开源创新与安全治理的平衡。

Method: 设计Auth Shim轻量级代理模式，作为兼容层转换企业IdP请求到目标应用的原生会话管理机制。要求目标应用必须提供安全的程序化管理API。通过Adobe案例研究验证模式有效性。

Result: 成功将流行的OSS BI工具与Okta SAML集成，实现了基于IAM组映射的自动化RBAC，消除了手动用户配置，提供了可重用、安全且成本效益高的企业SSO集成蓝图。

Conclusion: Auth Shim模式为集成任何独立OSS工具到企业SSO生态系统提供了可行的解决方案，使组织能够在保持安全治理的同时拥抱开源创新。

Abstract: Open-source software OSS is widely adopted in enterprise settings, but
standalone tools often lack native support for protocols like SAML or OIDC,
creating a critical security integration gap. This paper introduces and
formalizes the Auth Shim, a lightweight architectural pattern designed to solve
this problem. The Auth Shim is a minimal, external proxy service that acts as a
compatibility layer, translating requests from an enterprise Identity Provider
IdP into the native session management mechanism of a target application. A key
prerequisite for this pattern is that the target application must expose a
programmatic, secure administrative API. We present a case study of the
pattern's implementation at Adobe to integrate a popular OSS BI tool with Okta
SAML, which enabled automated Role-Based Access Control RBAC via IAM group
mapping and eliminated manual user provisioning. By defining its components,
interactions, and production deployment considerations, this paper provides a
reusable, secure, and cost-effective blueprint for integrating any standalone
OSS tool into an enterprise SSO ecosystem, thereby enabling organizations to
embrace open-source innovation without compromising on security governance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RepoDebug是一个多任务、多语言的仓库级代码调试数据集，包含22种错误子类型、支持8种编程语言和3种调试任务，用于评估LLM在复杂仓库级调试场景中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有调试数据集主要关注函数级代码修复，忽略了更复杂和现实的仓库级场景，导致对LLM在仓库级调试中面临的挑战理解不完整。

Method: 构建RepoDebug数据集，包含22种错误子类型、支持8种编程语言和3种调试任务，并在10个LLM上进行评估实验。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现最佳，但在仓库级调试中仍然表现不佳，表明当前LLM在此类复杂场景中仍面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: 仓库级代码调试是一个具有挑战性的任务，需要更先进的数据集和方法来提升LLM在此领域的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

*Haowei Quan,Junjie Wang,Xinzhe Li,Terry Yue Zhuo,Xiao Chen,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PyVul是首个全面的Python包漏洞基准测试套件，包含1,157个经过开发者验证的漏洞，提供提交和函数级别的标注，准确率达到100%和94%。评估显示现有检测工具在识别真实Python包安全漏洞方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python包作为组织、重用和分发单元存在大量漏洞报告，且Python常与其他语言协作增加了漏洞复杂性，当前漏洞检测工具的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入PyVul基准套件，采用LLM辅助的数据清洗方法提高标注准确性，进行漏洞分布分析，并评估最先进的检测工具。

Result: PyVul成为最精确的大规模Python漏洞基准，发现多语言Python包更容易受到漏洞影响，现有检测工具能力与实际需求存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前检测工具在识别Python包安全漏洞方面的局限性，强调了该领域未来发展的必要性。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaaSGuard是一个针对开源无服务器环境的统一DevSecOps管道，通过在开发生命周期的各个阶段嵌入轻量级安全检查，有效检测和防止关键漏洞，准确率达95%，召回率达91%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无服务器计算虽然简化了基础设施管理，但其短暂执行和细粒度扩展等特性带来了独特的安全挑战，特别是在OpenFaaS等开源平台中。现有方法通常只解决DevSecOps生命周期的孤立阶段，缺乏集成和全面的安全策略。

Method: 提出FaaSGuard统一DevSecOps管道，在开发生命周期的每个阶段（规划、编码、构建、部署和监控）系统性地嵌入轻量级、故障关闭的安全检查，有效应对注入攻击、硬编码密钥和资源耗尽等威胁。

Result: 通过对来自GitHub公共仓库的20个真实无服务器函数进行案例研究验证，FaaSGuard能够有效检测和防止关键漏洞，表现出高精度（95%）和高召回率（91%），且不会显著干扰现有的CI/CD实践。

Conclusion: FaaSGuard为开源无服务器环境提供了一个有效的集成安全解决方案，通过在DevSecOps生命周期的各个阶段嵌入安全检查，显著提升了安全防护能力，同时保持了开发效率。

Abstract: Serverless computing significantly alters software development by abstracting
infrastructure management and enabling rapid, modular, event-driven
deployments. Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless
functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose
unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like
OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the
DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy.
To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline
explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard
systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage
of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and
monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded
secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through
a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub
repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents
critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%)
without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.

*Joonhwi Joo*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个频率派决策理论框架，用于在多臂随机对照试验中选择最佳臂。该方法建立了最小最大后悔(MMR)最优决策规则，特别针对多元正态奖励分布，展示了二臂与多臂设计的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂随机对照试验中缺乏严谨的决策理论框架，特别是在处理异方差性和多臂比较时，需要系统化的方法来选择最优臂。

Method: 采用最小最大后悔(MMR)框架，推导出位置族奖励分布的最优决策规则。针对多元正态分布，建立了渐近MMR程序，通过协方差矩阵估计直接映射到决策边界。

Result: 发现二臂设计中"选择胜者"规则始终最优，而三臂及以上设计中需要非线性决策边界，系统性地惩罚高方差臂。方差在二臂比较中无关紧要，但在多臂比较中至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为多臂随机对照试验提供了严谨的决策理论基础和实用工具，扩展了经典决策理论到多臂比较场景。

Abstract: We develop a frequentist decision-theoretic framework for selecting the best
arm in one-shot, multi-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our approach
characterizes the minimax-regret (MMR) optimal decision rule for any
location-family reward distribution with full support. We show that the MMR
rule is deterministic, unique, and computationally tractable, as it can be
derived by solving the dual problem with nature's least-favorable prior. We
then specialize to the case of multivariate normal (MVN) rewards with an
arbitrary covariance matrix, and establish the local asymptotic minimaxity of a
plug-in version of the rule when only estimated means and covariances are
available. This asymptotic MMR (AMMR) procedure maps a covariance-matrix
estimate directly into decision boundaries, allowing straightforward
implementation in practice. Our analysis highlights a sharp contrast between
two-arm and multi-arm designs. With two arms, the empirical success rule
("pick-the-winner") remains MMR-optimal, regardless of the arm-specific
variances. By contrast, with three or more arms and heterogeneous variances,
the empirical success rule is no longer optimal: the MMR decision boundaries
become nonlinear and systematically penalize high-variance arms, requiring
stronger evidence to select them. This result underscores that variance plays
no role in optimal two-arm comparisons, but it matters critically when more
than two options are on the table. Our multi-arm AMMR framework extends
classical decision theory to multi-arm RCTs, offering a rigorous foundation and
a practical tool for comparing multiple policies simultaneously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具变量回归中的条件似然比检验在弱工具变量渐近下只基于浓度矩阵的最小特征值，这可能导致检验功效不足，特别是当存在不同程度识别的内生变量时。

Method: 推导了条件似然比检验在弱工具变量渐近下的精确渐近分布，该分布条件于浓度矩阵的所有特征值而非仅最小特征值，并提供了相应的计算方法。

Result: 数值分析表明，与现有基于最小特征值的渐近上界方法相比，所提出的精确分布方法能够显著提高检验功效，特别是在存在不同程度识别的内生变量时。

Conclusion: 通过考虑浓度矩阵的所有特征值而非仅最小特征值，本文提出的精确渐近分布方法为工具变量回归中的条件似然比检验提供了更强大的统计检验框架。

Abstract: We derive the exact asymptotic distribution of the conditional
likelihood-ratio test in instrumental variables regression under weak
instrument asymptotics and for multiple endogenous variables. The distribution
is conditional on all eigenvalues of the concentration matrix, rather than only
the smallest eigenvalue as in an existing asymptotic upper bound. This exact
characterization leads to a substantially more powerful test if there are
differently identified endogenous variables. We provide computational methods
implementing the test and demonstrate the power gains through numerical
analysis.

TL;DR: 本文开发了国家层面的综合评估模型FUND 3.9n，通过纳入部门特定的气候影响函数和参数不确定性分析，计算各国社会碳成本(NSCC)，发现低收入和中等收入国家的NSCC更高，为气候政策设计提供理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全球统一碳定价方法无法捕捉国家间异质性气候影响，需要开发国家层面的社会碳成本估算框架来支持差异化的气候政策制定和国际谈判。

Method: 扩展区域FUND 3.9框架，纳入部门特定气候影响函数和参数不确定性分析，覆盖198个国家，考虑经济结构、气候敏感性和人口暴露等异质性因素。

Result: NSCC和全球总和估计对损害规范和偏好参数高度敏感；与单一部门聚合方法相比，考虑不确定性的分解模型显示低收入和中等收入国家的NSCC更高；部门特定脆弱性和随机变异性放大了气候损害并重塑了NSCC分布的全球公平性。

Conclusion: 该模型为适应规划、减缓目标设定和国际气候谈判中的公平负担分担提供了政策相关指标，弥合了全球统一碳定价与国家差异化气候影响之间的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents a refined country-level integrated assessment model, FUND
3.9n, that extends the regional FUND 3.9 framework by incorporating
sector-specific climate impact functions and parametric uncertainty analysis
for 198 individual countries. The model enables estimation of the national
social cost of carbon (NSCC), capturing heterogeneity across nations from
economic structure, climate sensitivity, and population exposure. Our results
demonstrate that both the NSCC and the global sum estimates are highly
sensitive to damage specifications and preference parameters, including the
pure rate of time preference and relative risk aversion. Compared to aggregated
single-sector approaches, the disaggregated model with uncertainty yields
higher values of the NSCC for low- and middle-income countries. The paper
contributes to the literature by quantifying how sector-specific
vulnerabilities and stochastic variability amplify climate damages and reshape
global equity in the distribution of the NSCC. The NSCCs derived from our model
offer policy-relevant metrics for adaptation planning, mitigation target
setting, and equitable burden-sharing in international climate negotiations.
This approach bridges the gap between globally harmonized carbon pricing and
nationally differentiated climate impacts, providing a theoretically grounded
and empirically rich framework for future climate policy design.

TL;DR: 噪声认证在双寡头市场中通过两种相反效应影响卖家利润：降低信息准确性减少垂直差异化，但引入随机性创造差异化。风险中性买家时前者主导降低利润，损失厌恶买家时噪声认证可能提高利润。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究认证技术中的噪声如何影响不可观测产品质量的双寡头竞争中的卖家利润，探索噪声认证对市场差异化和消费者行为的复杂影响。

Method: 理论模型分析噪声认证在双寡头竞争中的效应，并通过实验验证理论预测，比较准确认证和噪声认证条件下的利润差异。

Result: 风险中性买家时噪声认证降低利润，损失厌恶买家时噪声认证可能提高利润，实验显示不准确认证处理比准确认证更有利可图，尤其在激烈竞争环境中。

Conclusion: 噪声认证对卖家利润的影响取决于买家风险偏好，损失厌恶可以缓解噪声的负面信息效应，使噪声认证在特定条件下成为有利策略。

Abstract: This paper studies how noise in certification technology affects seller
profits in a duopoly with unobservable product quality. We identify two
opposing effects of noisy certification. First, it reduces the informativeness
of certification outcomes, homogenizing buyers' beliefs and limiting the scope
for vertical differentiation. Second, it introduces randomness into buyer
perceptions, endogenously generating differentiation between otherwise similar
products. When buyers are risk-neutral, the first effect dominates, reducing
seller profits. However, when buyers are loss averse, the negative impact of
reduced informativeness is mitigated, and noisy certification can increase
profits relative to accurate certification. Experimentally, treatments with
inaccurate certification are more profitable than those with accurate
certification, particularly in settings with intense competition.

TL;DR: 日本1724个市区面板数据研究显示，旅游业对土地价格的推动作用主要集中在前5.9%的"超级明星"城市，大部分地区受益有限或无效果，存在显著的非线性和空间异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游业被认为是经济和城市变革的催化剂，但其对土地价格的影响存在争议，需要更深入的实证研究来明确这种关系的特征和机制。

Method: 使用2021-2024年日本1724个市区的面板数据，以年度游客到达量作为旅游活动的代理指标，采用中介分析和面板阈值回归法进行研究。

Result: 发现大规模土地价格上涨仅集中在少数"超级明星"城市（前5.9%游客到达量），大多数市区受到的影响微小或为零；旅游业与土地价格增长的机制混杂，既有对居民的潜在好处也有增加负担的风险。

Conclusion: 旅游业对土地价格的影响存在显著的空间异质性和非线性特征，需要制定政策促进包容性增长和旅游相关收益的公平分配。

Abstract: While tourism is widely regarded as a catalyst for economic and urban
transformation, its effects on land prices remain contested. This study
examines tourism and land prices using a panel of 1,724 Japanese municipalities
from 2021 to 2024, with annual tourist arrivals as a proxy for tourism
activity. Using mediation analysis and panel threshold regression, we show that
sizable land price increases are concentrated in a small group of "superstar"
cities, specifically those in the top 5.9 percent for tourist arrivals, while
most municipalities experience little or no effect. The results highlight
pronounced nonlinearities and spatial heterogeneity in tourism's economic
impact across Japan. The potential mechanisms linking tourism to land price
growth are mixed, with possible benefits for local residents as well as risks
of increased burdens. These findings underscore the need for policies that
promote inclusive growth and an equitable distribution of tourism-related
gains.

Motivation: 研究在公开检查但发送者行为隐藏的重复博弈中，欺骗被发现后关系终止或有限惩罚的均衡特性，为审计、认证和平台治理提供理论依据。

Method: 建立重复发送者-接收者博弈模型，分析公开状态的一维特性，证明存在具有截止检查和单调欺骗的平稳均衡，并扩展到噪声检查、静默审计等场景。

Result: 发现发送者的混合策略确定了截止点的闭式总检查概率，有限惩罚阶段可实现与终止相同的截止效果，模型具有可测试的审计和治理含义。

Conclusion: 该模型为审计、认证和平台治理提供了重要理论支持，展示了随着声誉变化而逐渐减少检查、检查激增后终止集中等现象的可测试含义。

Abstract: We study a repeated sender-receiver game where inspections are public but the
sender's action is hidden unless inspected. A detected deception ends the
relationship or triggers a finite punishment. We show the public state is one
dimensional and prove existence of a stationary equilibrium with cutoff
inspection and monotone deception. The sender's mixing pins down a closed-form
total inspection probability at the cutoff, and a finite punishment phase
implements the same cutoffs as termination. We extend to noisy checks, silent
audits, and rare public alarms, preserving the Markov structure and continuity
as transparency vanishes or becomes full. The model yields testable
implications for auditing, certification, and platform governance: tapering
inspections with reputation, bunching of terminations after inspection spurts,
and sharper cutoffs as temptation rises relative to costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究专家在职业声誉考虑下的推荐行为，分析声誉如何影响专家的风险推荐决策

Method: 建立连续信号环境下的博弈模型，专家观察私有信号后推荐风险或安全选项，使用截止规则分析均衡

Result: 声誉越高专家越保守（截止值提高），信息量和先验降低截止值，职业关注增强提高截止值；成功奖励与实验存在一一对应关系

Conclusion: 高声誉专家推荐风险选项更少但条件命中率更高，为委员会和监督提供了可实施的调节杠杆

Abstract: We study expert recommendations under career concerns in a continuous signal
environment. An expert observes a private signal about a binary payoff and
recommends risky or safe; recommendations and outcomes are public and affect
reputation and implementation. Equilibrium advice follows a cutoff rule. Under
a mild relative-diagnosticity condition, the cutoff increases with reputation
(reputational conservatism); informativeness and priors lower the cutoff while
stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus provides a
one-to-one mapping to experimentation. The theory predicts fewer risky
recommendations but higher conditional hit rates for high-reputation experts
and yields implementable levers for committees and monitoring.

### [193] [Reputation, Risk, and Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04037)
*Georgy Lukyanov*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文研究了声誉如何影响专家决策保守性，发现结果可见性是关键因素。在对称可见性下，职业关注不会导致保守主义；而增加失败可见性（如注册报告）会削弱高声誉专家的谨慎行为并放松选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨声誉机制下专家何时会采取保守策略，以及何种政策能够改变这种行为，特别关注结果可见性这一单一因素的作用。

Method: 使用两页模型，包含二元信号和结果，分析对称可见性和不对称可见性（失败可见性增加）两种情况下的专家决策行为。

Result: 发现对称可见性下职业关注不会产生保守主义；增加失败可见性会减弱高声誉专家的谨慎倾向并放松选择过程。

Conclusion: 结果可见性是影响专家决策保守性的重要杠杆，政策干预（如注册报告）可以通过改变可见性结构来影响专家的风险承担行为。

Abstract: When does reputation make experts play it safe, and what policy reverses
that? I isolate a single lever - visibility of outcomes. In a two-page model
with binary signals and outcomes, I show: (i) with an uninformative safe option
and symmetric visibility, career concerns alone do not generate conservatism;
(ii) increasing failure visibility (as in Registered Reports) weakens
high-reputation caution and relaxes selection. I provide a
necessary-and-sufficient local sign test, agnostic about utility curvature and
allowing informative safe actions, and an identification map suitable for
staggered RR adoption.

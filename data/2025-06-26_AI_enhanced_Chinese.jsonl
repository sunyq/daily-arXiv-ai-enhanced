Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information\n(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in\ninterference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant\ncommunication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,\nthereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.\nIn this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on\na learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP\nattention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,\nspatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a\nself-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS\npattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel\noccupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on\nlocally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no\ncommunication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a\nmulti-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the\nspatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it\nand accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes\nthat enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve\nthe prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks\nthat use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the\nchannel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across\ndifferent node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability\nacross different periods of CS sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5MiLAAP\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9053\u8df3\u9891\uff08CS\uff09\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u9002\u5e94\u5e72\u6270\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u541e\u5410\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u72b6\u6001\u5171\u4eab\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u907f\u514d\u72b6\u6001\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiLAAP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u672c\u5730\u88ab\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "MiLAAP\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MiLAAP\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u9053\u5360\u7528\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u541e\u5410\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code\nwritten for government applications. In particular, government enterprise\nsoftware is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language\ncode (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context\nwindow size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are\nprimarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited\ntesting with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy\nlanguages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines\nthe application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written\nin ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We\ninvestigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary\nmodule comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking\nmethods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including\nGPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs\ncan select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We\nalso find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks\nsuch as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that\nare up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create\npartitions.

Among other factors, spray boom\ninstability is one of the major contributors to application errors. Spray\nbooms' width of 38m, combined with 30 kph driving speeds, varying terrain, and\nmachine dynamics when maneuvering complex field boundaries, make controls of\nthese booms very complex. However, there is no quantitative knowledge on the\nextent of boom movement to systematically develop a solution that might include\nboom designs and responsive boom control systems. Therefore, this study was\nconducted to develop an automated computer vision system to quantify the boom\nmovement of various agricultural sprayers. A computer vision system was\ndeveloped to track a target on the edge of the sprayer boom in real time. YOLO\nV7, V8, and V11 neural network models were trained to track the boom's\nmovements in field operations to quantify effective displacement in the\nvertical and transverse directions. An inclinometer sensor was mounted on the\nboom to capture boom angles and validate the neural network model output.

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)\nframework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of\ntargets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance\nthrough a more principled probabilistic loss.

However, existing methods\nprimarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,\noverlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve\nas a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the\nvisual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose\nToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial\nawareness to guide the token merging process.

With the introduced spatial\nawareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves\ncritical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA\noutperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual\nand embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,\nmaking it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects.

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs\ncan be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in\nmedical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact.

Within this\nframework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in\n3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental\npillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that\nunderpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning,\nand 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these\ncapabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous\ndriving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across\ndata, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing\nmore robust and generalizable 3D world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ece2D\u611f\u77e5\u52303D\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e863D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e24\u5927\u6280\u672f\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e863D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u88653D\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece2D\u611f\u77e5\u52303D\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u67903D\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e24\u5927\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba83D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e863D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u901a\u7528\u76843D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

These\nlimitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision\nscenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that\nintegrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the\nanalytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and\nexecution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages\nin-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,\ninterpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both\nsolutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we\nconstruct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework\nwith metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.\nExperimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM\nbaselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,\nreasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios.

The\nautomatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria\nfrom a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each\npruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of\nthe training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the\nnetwork is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in\nthe network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual\nallocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on\nthe VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced\ndocument understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,\nexisting models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world\nscenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the\ncurrent response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation\nand ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned\nvisual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently\nresults in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise\nanswer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and\nproblem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR\nhallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test\nsamples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world\ndegradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'\ncapacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and\nanswer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding\nhallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and\nthereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based\nframework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness\nof visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer\nto increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement\nlearning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous\nregions.

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the\nSPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase\nrecognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming\nfull-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

COIN estimates the empirical\nerror rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as\nClopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error\nrate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty\nthreshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing\nsample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong\ntest-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency\nunder limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text\ngeneration tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound\nconstructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,\nwhich underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application\nscenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "COIN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\u9608\u503c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684FDR\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7b5b\u9009\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\uff08FDR\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Clopper-Pearson\u7b49\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u771f\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5927\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "COIN\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "COIN\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e0a\u754c\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To\naddress the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial\ntransformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6ce8\u518c\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08HSI\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\uff08MSI\uff09\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u9f50HSI\u548cMSI\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u4e14\u5904\u7406\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5149\u8c31\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SPL\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f2\u7a00\u758f\u878d\u5408\uff08BSF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528PAO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u57df\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6ce8\u518c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This\ndenoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned\nlatent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of\nhigher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima\nthat are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally\nmisaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior\nefforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or\nmanipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random\nZigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect\nand escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first\nidentifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it\ninjects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current\noptimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories,\naccepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat\nenables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random\nzigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and\nbackward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the\ngenerated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and\ncompatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that\nCtrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X\nincrease in function evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCtrl-Z Sampling\u7684\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u66ff\u524d\u5411\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u540e\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u521d\u59cb\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "Ctrl-Z Sampling\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u56de\u9000\u5230\u66f4\u65e9\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u9003\u79bb\u3002\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u66ff\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCtrl-Z Sampling\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea67.6\u500d\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "Ctrl-Z Sampling\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing radiomic\napproaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at\nthe population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While\ninterpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent\nindividual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based\napproaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent\nend-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic\nfeatures. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic\nselection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the\npoor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic\nfingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is\ndynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the\nexisting radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient\nbasis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and\nselecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual\npatients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a\nlow-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for\ndownstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic\ntasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)\ntears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic\naccuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models.

The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,\nwhich connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing\nfeature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image\nposition encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT\nachieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson\nAGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,\noutperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose\nDyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by\nselecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search\narea features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an\nefficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios.

However, training\ndiffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and\nexisting zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond\ntraining resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and\nspatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,\nzero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural\ncoherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion\nmodels. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from\nthe pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel\nwavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion\nmethods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the\nbase image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer\nretains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural\nconsistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine\ndetails and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL\ndemonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in\nprior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality.

Additionally, YOLOv8x-seg models\nsegment bone levels and tooth masks to determine bone loss patterns (horizontal\nvs. angular) via geometric analysis. Evaluated on a large, expertly annotated\ndataset of 1000 radiographs, our approach achieved high accuracy in detecting\nbone loss severity (intra-class correlation coefficient up to 0.80) and bone\nloss pattern classification (accuracy 87%). This automated system offers a\nrapid, objective, and reproducible tool for periodontal assessment, reducing\nreliance on subjective manual evaluation.

The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs\nare particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and\ninference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify\nthe decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we\nsystematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order.

However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to\nbe effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce\nsemi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.\nState-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial\nCNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional\nneural network, which achieves promising results.

The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal.

To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages.

However, a\nkey challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,\nwhich cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the\noriginal viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen\nareas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that\nenables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore\nfrom arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge\ninto two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts\nand floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures\nspatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality\nin novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration\nmodel designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data\ncollection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for\nWorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D\nscene generation.

Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual\nfeatures to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect\nforged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to\nidentify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative\nnetworks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ\ndepending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within\nthe RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become\nmore sophisticated. In short, over-reliance on a single visual cue makes\nexisting forgery detectors struggle to generalize across diverse remote sensing\ndata. This paper proposed a novel forgery detection framework called SFNet,\ndesigned to identify fake images in diverse remote sensing data by leveraging\nspatial and frequency domain features. Specifically, to obtain rich and\ncomprehensive visual information, SFNet employs two independent feature\nextractors to capture spatial and frequency domain features from input RSIs.

The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene\nCompletion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level\ninformation, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.\nWhile PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images\nremain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches\nutilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene\nvolume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during\ntraining, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to\ndynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages\ncontext-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address\nvision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively\ninitializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image\ncontext and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding\nto reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships.

We prove that well-typed programs respect\ntheir protocols and never run into deadlocks at run-time; we also demonstrate\nthe expressiveness gains with respect to prior work by means of examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u786e\u4fdd\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6b7b\u9501\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6b7b\u9501\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6001\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u7c7b\u578b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65e2\u9075\u5b88\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6b7b\u9501\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6b7b\u9501\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

As the algorithms that achieve practical\nquantum advantage are beyond manual tuning, quantum circuit optimization has\nbecome extremely important and integrated into today's quantum software stack.\nThis paper focuses on a critical type of quantum circuit optimization --\nphase-polynomial optimization. Phase polynomials represents a class of\nbuilding-block circuits that appear frequently in quantum modular exponentials\n(the most time-consuming component in Shor's factoring algorithm), in quantum\napproximation optimization algorithms (QAOA), and in Hamiltonian simulations.\nCompared to prior work on phase polynomials, we focus more on the impact of\nphase polynomial synthesis in the context of whole-circuit optimization, from\nsingle-block phase polynomials to multiple block phase polynomials, from greedy\nequivalent sub-circuit replacement strategies to a systematic parity matrix\noptimization approach, and from hardware-oblivious logical circuit optimization\nto hardware-friendly logical circuit optimization. We also provide a utility of\nour phase polynomial optimization framework to generate hardware-friendly\nbuilding blocks. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of up to 50%-with an\naverage total gate reduction of 34.92%-and reductions in the CNOT gate count of\nup to 48.57%, averaging 28.53%, for logical circuits.

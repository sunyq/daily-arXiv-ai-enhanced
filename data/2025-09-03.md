### [1] [A Comparative Study of Controllability, Explainability, and Performance in Dysfluency Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00058)
*Eric Zhang,Li Wei,Sarah Chen,Michael Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对四种口吃检测模型（YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM和SSDM）进行了系统性比较分析，从性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度评估，发现UDM在准确性和临床可解释性方面达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型在基准数据集上的性能不断提升，但临床采用不仅需要准确性，还需要模型具有可控性和可解释性。

Method: 通过在多数据集上的综合评估和临床专家评估，从性能、可控性和可解释性三个维度系统比较四种代表性方法。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet提供效率和简单性但透明度有限；UDM实现准确性和临床可解释性的最佳平衡；SSDM在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了不同方法之间的权衡关系，为临床可行的口吃建模指明了未来方向，并提供了详细的实施见解和实际部署考虑。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

### [2] [Beyond Memorization: Reasoning-Driven Synthesis as a Mitigation Strategy Against Benchmark Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00072)
*Terry Jingchen Zhang,Gopal Dev,Ning Wang,Nicole Ni,Wenyuan Jiang,Yinya Huang,Bernhard Schölkopf,Mrinmaya Sachan,Zhijing Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过arXiv论文合成研究级QA问题来评估LLM的数据污染问题，发现前沿模型在知识截止日期前后没有显著性能衰减，表明多步推理合成方法能有效缓解基准污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM能力评估面临数据污染担忧，静态基准可能测量的是记忆而非真正推理能力。需要新的评估方法来区分记忆和推理。

Method: 利用arXiv论文的时间结构，从20,277篇论文合成1,643个多步推理问题，覆盖26个月时间跨度，评估4个前沿模型在知识截止日期前后的表现。

Result: 所有模型在不同规模、开发者和发布时间下，在知识截止日期附近均未显示显著性能衰减，与之前报告显著衰减的研究形成对比。

Conclusion: 多步推理合成方法提供了超越浅层记忆的复杂性，是缓解基准污染的有效策略，应优先采用推理驱动的合成方法而非简单收集新问题。

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

### [3] [Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074)
*Cédric Colas,Tracey Mills,Ben Prystawski,Michael Henry Tessler,Noah Goodman,Jacob Andreas,Joshua Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个计算框架，将社会学习建模为基于感觉运动和语言数据的结构化可执行世界模型的联合概率推断，通过将预训练语言模型转化为人类分享建议的概率模型，实现了语言指导加速学习和知识跨代积累。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够将他人语言指导与直接经验结合，实现安全快速的学习，研究旨在探索人类如何整合这两种知识来源，并为AI系统提供类似的能力。

Method: 使用计算框架将社会学习建模为联合概率推断，将预训练语言模型转化为人类分享建议的概率模型，通过10个视频游戏的实验和模拟验证方法。

Result: 语言指导能够塑造探索行为并加速学习，减少风险交互并加快关键发现，实现了人类与模型之间的成功知识传递。

Conclusion: 结构化、语言兼容的表征可能实现人机协作学习，为构建能够整合语言指导和直接经验的AI系统提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

### [4] [Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00079)
*Andrew G. A. Correa,Ana C. H de Matos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 一种基于低代价不确定性指导的精细化循环方法，通过分析分词不确定性来触发针对性修改，以小模型达到大模型95%性能但仅需1/3成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决理由模型高成本、高延迟的问题，寻找一种在质量和成本之间的平衡方案

Method: 使用分词级别不确定性（生成概率、热门分词熵空置）来触发针对性精细化，将紧凑的不确定性报告回传给模型指导修改

Result: 在理由、数学和代码生成任务中，小模型达到参考理由模型95%质量，成本降低到1/3，准确率提半16%点，仅需31%响应需要精细化

Conclusion: 该不确定性感知循环提供了单次推理和豆尾式理由链之间的有效平衡点，适合生产环境中的实际部署

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

### [5] [Wrong Face, Wrong Move: The Social Dynamics of Emotion Misperception in Agent-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00080)
*David Freire-Obregón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过赋予不同准确度的情感分类器来探索感知准确性对智能体情感和空间行为的影响，发现低准确度分类器导致信任降低、情感分裂和社会混乱，而高准确度则形成稳定的情感集群和情绪韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类检测和响应他人情绪的能力是社会行为理解的基础，研究旨在探索情绪感知准确性如何影响智能体的情感和空间行为，特别是系统性的误感知对社交过程的影响。

Method: 在2D环形网格上部署智能体，使用KDEF数据库的人脸照片作为视觉表示，赋予三种不同准确度的情感分类器（基于JAFFE、CK+、KDEF数据集训练）。智能体基于感知到的情绪而非真实情绪进行移动决策（趋近积极情绪，远离消极情绪）。在均质和异质群体以及重复情绪冲击场景下进行实验。

Result: 低准确度分类器导致信任降低、情感分裂为悲伤情绪、社会组织混乱；高准确度分类器形成稳定的情感集群和对情绪干扰的韧性；即使在情绪中性场景中，误感知也足以产生隔离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 情绪识别中的偏见或不精确可能显著扭曲社交过程并破坏情感整合，强调了准确情绪感知对社会凝聚力的重要性。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

### [6] [Ensemble Debates with Local Large Language Models for AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00091)
*Ephraiem Sarabamoun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本地开源模型集成辩论能提升AI对齐能力，在150场辩论中集成方法比单模型表现更好，特别是在推理深度和论证质量方面有显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在重要决策中扮演更重要角色，需要确保其与人类价值观对齐。依赖专有API限制了研究的可复现性和广泛参与，因此研究本地开源模型的集成辩论方法

Method: 使用本地开源模型进行集成辩论，涵盖15个场景和5种集成配置，共进行150场辩论，使用7点评分标准进行评估

Result: 集成方法整体得分3.48 vs 单模型3.13，推理深度提升19.4%，论证质量提升34.1%，真实性和人类增强方面改进最大

Conclusion: 集成辩论方法为基于集成的对齐评估提供了可访问和可复现的基础，证明了本地开源模型在提升AI对齐能力方面的有效性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes
decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary
APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local
open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across
150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles
outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing
an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment
evaluation.

### [7] [MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100)
*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由机制替代传统向量数据库，在小型领域特定语料库上实现高效检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖大型向量数据库和交叉编码器，对于小型领域特定语料库来说过于复杂和资源密集，需要更轻量级的解决方案

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序

Result: 在100-500个文本块的HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库上，MODE在答案质量上匹配或超过密集检索基线，同时减少端到端检索时间

Conclusion: MODE为中小型语料库提供了实用的解决方案，在简单性、速度和主题聚焦方面表现出色，聚类粒度和多聚类路由控制召回率/精确度的权衡

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

### [8] [Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115)
*Manish Shukla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个自适应多维监控算法(AMDM)，用于改进多智能体AI系统的评估和异常检测，填补了之前研究中缺乏算法实现和实证证据的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体AI系统评估过于依赖技术指标，缺乏对人类中心和经济维度的考量，需要开发更全面的监控框架来确保系统在真实世界部署中的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了自适应多维监控(AMDM)算法，包括：1)标准化异构指标；2)应用每轴指数加权移动平均阈值；3)通过马哈拉诺比斯距离进行联合异常检测。

Result: AMDM在模拟实验中显著改善性能：异常检测延迟从12.3秒降至5.6秒，误报率从4.5%降至0.9%。同时提供了对比表、ROC/PR曲线和案例研究重新分析。

Conclusion: AMDM算法有效解决了多智能体AI系统监控中的关键问题，提供了可复现的解决方案，有助于推动更全面的人类中心AI评估框架的发展。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

### [9] [Know When to Explore: Difficulty-Aware Certainty as a Guide for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00125)
*Ang Li,Zhihang Yuan,Yang Zhang,Shouda Liu,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DACE是一种新颖的强化学习算法，通过利用LLM的自信心与任务难度和解决方案质量的相关性，动态平衡探索与利用的权衡，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVF方法依赖稀疏的基于结果的奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率。模型无法区分高质量和低效解决方案，也无法从不同类型的失败中有效学习。

Method: 提出Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE)算法：在线评估基于策略成功率的任务难度，利用该信号调节内在奖励。对于困难任务惩罚高确定性以鼓励探索，对于简单任务奖励高确定性以鼓励学习效率。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME、MATH）上，DACE显著优于强基线方法。DACE训练的模型不仅达到更高准确率，而且在扩展测试时计算时表现出更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能够促进有效探索而不牺牲精确性，验证了利用LLM自信心与任务难度相关性来指导强化学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

*Davin Choo,Yohai Trabelsi,Fentabil Getnet,Samson Warkaye Lamma,Wondesen Nigatu,Kasahun Sime,Lisa Matay,Milind Tambe,Stéphane Verguet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了HARP工具，基于优化框架为埃塞俄比亚医疗设施规划提供决策支持，旨在预算不确定下最大化人口覆盖并满足地区比例目标，提出了两种算法并验证了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 埃塞俄比亚卫生部需要加强卫生站建设以实现全民健康覆盖，但由于预算有限和竞争优先级，需要优化框架来指导各地区优先顺序

Method: 开发了Health Access Resource Planner (HARP)工具，基于原则性决策支持优化框架，提出了两种算法：(i)学习增强方法改进专家建议；(ii)多步规划的贪心算法，均具有强最坏情况近似估计

Result: 与埃塞俄比亚公共卫生研究所和卫生部合作，在三个地区的多种规划场景中验证了方法的实证效果

Conclusion: HARP工具为埃塞俄比亚医疗资源规划提供了有效的优化框架，能够在预算约束下最大化医疗覆盖并满足地区公平性要求

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

### [11] [Virtual Group Knowledge and Group Belief in Topological Evidence Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00184)
*Alexandru Baltag,Malvin Gattinger,Djanira Gomes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了多智能体证据模型中的群体知识和信念概念，通过将基于证据的信念和可错知识的拓扑语义从个体扩展到群体，完全公理化并证明了群体证据逻辑的可判定性，特别关注群体知识和群体信念逻辑片段，还引入了动态证据共享算子并证明了相应逻辑的完全公理化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中群体层面的知识和信念形成机制，特别是在证据基础上的群体认知状态，旨在建立形式化的逻辑框架来描述和分析群体认知过程。

Method: 扩展拓扑语义学方法，将个体层面的证据基础信念和可错知识语义扩展到群体层面，使用公理化方法构建逻辑系统，并引入动态证据共享算子来建模信息交流过程。

Result: 完全公理化了群体证据逻辑（包括"硬"和"软"证据），证明了其可判定性；特别对群体知识和群体信念逻辑片段进行了完整的形式化；扩展了动态证据共享算子并证明了相应逻辑的完全公理化，显示其与静态基础具有相同的表达能力。

Conclusion: 成功建立了多智能体证据模型中群体知识和信念的完整逻辑框架，证明了相关逻辑系统的可判定性和完全公理化，为分析群体认知过程提供了有力的形式化工具，动态扩展保持了表达能力的同时增强了模型的实用性。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

*Jinzhou Tang,Jusheng Zhang,Qinhan Lv,Sidi Liu,Jing Yang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiVA是一个新颖的自主代理框架，通过语义-拓扑进化算法将代理工作流建模为自组织图，在未知环境中实现了任务准确率5-10%的提升和资源效率的增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自主代理范式的关键权衡问题：固定工作流需要手动重新配置，而灵活反应循环无法将推理进展提炼为可转移结构。

Method: HiVA框架使用语义-拓扑进化(STEV)算法，将代理工作流建模为自组织图，通过多臂老虎机前向路由、环境反馈生成诊断梯度，以及协调更新来共同进化个体语义和拓扑结构。

Result: 在对话、编码、长上下文问答、数学和代理基准测试中，任务准确率提高了5-10%，资源效率也得到增强。

Conclusion: HiVA框架在自主任务执行方面表现出有效性，通过自组织图建模和语义-拓扑协同进化解决了现有范式的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究代理系统都是硬编码的固定研究策略，缺乏灵活性和通用性

Abstract: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly
encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research
agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research
strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research
(UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and
enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep
research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To
showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal,
expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to
facilitate experimentation with the system.

### [14] [Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251)
*Rimom Costa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILWS通过指令级权重塑形技术，让大语言模型能够通过会话反馈和反思动态更新知识，无需检索增强或微调，显著提升企业支持效率并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型静态知识更新的问题，避免RAG的高延迟和工程开销、提示工程的脆弱性以及微调的高成本和灾难性遗忘风险。

Method: 使用策划的系统指令作为外部可审计的伪参数，通过反思引擎分析会话轨迹，提出指令、用户偏好和工具的增量更新，并通过蒸馏将改进转化为权重空间。

Result: 在企业支持中吞吐量提升2.4-5.0倍，审核幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud概念验证中，每小时工单处理量提升4-5倍，单工单时间降低约80%。

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，适用于需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域，如法律、医疗和工程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

TL;DR: LLM代理将成为未来数据系统的主要工作负载，其高吞吐量的探索性数据处理方式（称为代理推测）对现有数据系统构成挑战，需要设计新的代理优先架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在数据处理中日益重要，其高吞吐量的探索性工作模式对现有数据系统提出了新的性能挑战，需要专门优化来支持代理工作负载。

Method: 通过分析代理推测的四个特征（规模、异构性、冗余性和可引导性），提出新的研究机会，包括新型查询接口、查询处理技术和代理内存存储。

Result: 识别了代理工作负载对数据系统的特殊需求，为开发代理优先的数据系统架构提供了理论框架和研究方向。

Conclusion: 数据系统需要从根本上重新设计，以原生支持LLM代理的高吞吐量探索性数据处理需求，这代表了数据系统架构的重要演进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

TL;DR: SHERPA是一个模型驱动框架，通过将领域特定最佳实践融入分层状态机来提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现，提供更细粒度的行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型能力强大，但缺乏结构化推理能力，特别是在需要领域特定最佳实践的复杂任务中。现有的多步提示方法缺乏通用机制来控制LLM行为。

Method: 提出SHERPA框架，使用分层状态机结构化LLM执行过程，通过基于规则或机器学习（包括LLM）的决策来实现细粒度行为控制。

Result: 在代码生成、类名生成和问答等多种任务中，SHERPA不仅复现了先前方法的性能，还进一步提升了表现。系统评估显示，精心设计的状态机显著提高了LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: SHERPA特别适用于具有完善人类最佳实践但缺乏训练数据的复杂任务，通过状态机集成有效提升了LLM的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的表现，相比传统的Best-of-N和Majority Voting方法，ORMs在BIRD和Spider基准测试中取得了更好的执行准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍存在用户意图与数据库模式精确对齐的困难，现有的测试时策略如Best-of-N和Majority Voting依赖表面启发式方法，而基于语义正确性的结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了训练Text-to-SQL任务ORMs的框架，在BIRD和Spider基准上评估ORMs，并对Qwen2、Granite3和Llama3等开源LLMs进行微调，比较ORMs与执行型Best-of-N和Majority Voting的表现。

Result: ORMs在BIRD基准上比执行型Best-of-N提升4.33%的执行准确率，比Majority Voting提升2.91%；在Spider基准上分别提升2.10%和0.93%。对已与SQL生成对齐的模型(如OmniSQL)进行微调可获得更优的ORM性能。

Conclusion: ORMs作为Best-of-N的有效启发式方法，在Text-to-SQL任务中优于传统方法，特别是在复杂查询和更多候选查询的情况下表现更好，为提升LLMs在数据库查询生成中的对齐性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

TL;DR: SIGMUS系统利用大语言模型实现城市多模态数据的语义集成，自动识别事件与多源数据间的关系，构建知识图谱，无需人工规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市传感器产生大量多模态数据，但这些数据分散且难以整合，需要人工推理来识别事件与多模态数据间的关系，限制了事件分析和预测能力。

Method: 开发SIGMUS系统，使用大语言模型生成必要的世界知识，识别城市事件与多模态数据间的关系，将组织化的知识表示为知识图谱。

Result: 系统能够合理连接5种不同数据源（新闻文本、监控图像、空气质量、天气和交通测量）与同时同地发生的相关事件。

Conclusion: SIGMUS通过LLM驱动的语义集成方法，成功实现了城市多模态数据的自动关联和知识组织，为城市事件分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

Motivation: 研究AI代理系统在多模态网络数据生产力方面的提升潜力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻写作领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，包含6k人工验证的真实新闻案例，将多模态内容转换为文本，评估开源和闭源LLM在新闻写作任务中的表现，包括叙事视角识别、关键词查询、历史背景检索和完整文章生成。

Result: 评估显示AI代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面表现不佳，反映了现实世界新闻写作中存在的信息差距挑战。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估AI代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力提供了一个现实的测试平台，有助于推动代理在真实世界生产力中的应用发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰淇淋的融化稳定性是影响消费者接受度和产品质量的关键因素，需要研究不同稳定剂对融化行为的影响并寻找更具成本效益的配方。

Method: 制备含不同添加剂的冰淇淋样品，在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用延时摄影记录融化过程，并利用Python和OpenCV进行图像处理和分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气室基质；重新冷冻后再融化的样品显示出更强的结构韧性；不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，通过评估性能和成本，证明了开发平衡耐久性和经济效益的配方的潜力，对小型和商业冰淇淋生产具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Motivation: 现有方法如静态提示工程或孤立代理模拟存在局限性，需要一种动态的、可扩展的集体智能框架，能够实现自适应学习、知识共享和持续改进。

Method: 1) 用户与LLM形成个性化认知对；2) GA辅助的前向-后向进化优化提示和任务性能；3) 多子类大脑通过群体智能协调；4) 标准化行为整合为超类大脑。

Result: 提出了理论框架和初步实现（如无人机调度、关键词过滤），建立了跨认知对知识整合的注册机制。

Conclusion: 该工作为可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI提供了概念基础和架构路线图，实现了抽象化、泛化和自我改进的元智能。

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

Motivation: 人类能凭直觉模拟未言明的社交动态并推理他人视角，而AI系统在自动构建和推理这些隐式社交语境方面存在困难。

Method: 采用POMDP驱动设计，将社交互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、智能体行动、心智状态），可从自由形式叙述中自动推导。

Result: 在5个社交推理任务上显著提升LLM理解能力（如FANToM心理理论推理+51%），在SOTOPIA社交交互基准上决策能力提升达+18%。

Conclusion: S3AP作为强大的通用社交世界状态表示形式，有望开发出更具社交意识的系统，更好地导航社交互动。

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

Conclusion: BALM-TSF能够有效利用文本和时间序列的互补信息，证明了平衡多模态对齐的重要性

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

Motivation: 开发通用ML网络模型需要从真实网络环境中收集多样化流量数据，但现有浏览器自动化工具在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面存在不足，且脆弱成本高。

Method: 用户用自然语言规则定义状态依赖动作的工作流，这些抽象规范被编译成非确定性有限自动机(NFAs)，状态合成组件将其转换为可重用的可执行代码，支持确定性重放和状态缓存减少LLM调用。

Result: NetGent自动化了50多个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬虫等领域，生成了真实的流量轨迹，并对UI变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent通过结合基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复的数据集提供了可扩展的基础，推动了网络ML的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Conclusion: 模块化架构和形式化知识表示能够通过计算高效模型使复杂法律推理更易实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为未来更透明、可信和有效的法律AI系统奠定基础

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全模态大语言模型在音频-视频理解和环境感知方面取得显著进展，但仍存在幻觉问题。文本模态先验主导导致模型过度依赖文本线索而忽视视觉和音频信息，且现有模型在训练时独立对齐各模态而忽略了视频与音频的内在关联。

Method: 提出OmniDPO偏好对齐框架，包含两种策略：(1)构建文本偏好样本对以增强模型对音频-视频交互的理解；(2)构建多模态偏好样本对以加强模型对视觉和听觉信息的注意力。

Result: 在两个全模态大语言模型上的实验表明，OmniDPO不仅有效缓解了多模态幻觉，还显著提升了模型跨模态的推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过同时解决文本主导和模态间关联忽略的问题，有效改善了多模态基础能力并减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

*Govind Waghmare,Sumedh BG,Sonia Gupta,Srikanta Bedathur*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化上下文注入框架，通过将任务特定信息系统性地嵌入输入中来指导LLMs解决图问题，无需微调即可实现成本效益和轻量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图推理任务对LLMs具有挑战性，需要将任务映射到概念基础表示，但通过微调或多步查询实现这种映射成本高且效率低。

Method: 结构化上下文注入方法，将结构化上下文直接注入输入，使LLM能够隐式地将任务与基础概念空间对齐。

Result: 在多个图任务上评估显示性能持续改进，结构化输入上下文可以媲美或超越更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是LLMs图理解的有效且可扩展策略，在准确性和计算成本之间提供了良好权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L-MARS是一个法律多智能体工作流系统，通过协调的多智能体推理和检索来减少法律问答中的幻觉和不确定性，相比传统RAG方法在准确性和可靠性方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单次检索增强生成(RAG)在法律问答中存在幻觉和不确定性高的问题，需要更精确的法律检索和验证机制来确保回答的权威性和准确性。

Method: 将查询分解为子问题，在异构数据源(Serper网络搜索、本地RAG、CourtListener案例法)进行定向搜索，使用法官智能体验证充分性、管辖权和时效性，通过迭代的推理-搜索-验证循环来维护连贯性并过滤噪声证据。

Result: 在LegalSearchQA基准测试(200个2025年最新法律选择题)上，L-MARS显著提高了事实准确性，减少了不确定性，并在人类专家和LLM评委评估中获得更高偏好分数。

Conclusion: 多智能体推理与智能体搜索相结合为在高风险领域部署LLM提供了可扩展且可复现的蓝图，能够实现精确的法律检索和审议。

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

TL;DR: 提出了Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS)方法，通过在训练时选择符合物理规律且数值接近目标的推理轨迹，提高大型推理模型在材料发现中的准确性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的材料发现需要准确、校准且物理可接受的配方到属性预测器。现有训练管道使用二元正确性或学习偏好信号来选择推理轨迹，但这些方法不能很好地反映物理可接受性。

Method: 引入Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS)训练时轨迹选择方案，优先选择符合基础物理原理且数值接近目标的推理轨迹，并使用轻量级停止机制控制计算成本。

Result: 与各种拒绝采样基线相比，该方法提高了准确性和校准度，降低了物理违规率，并降低了采样成本。

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择，为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了可靠、高效大型推理模型的实用路径。

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在马尔可夫决策过程中优化夏普比率的新方法，使用Dinkelbach变换将分数目标转换为均值-方差优化问题，并开发了收敛的策略迭代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夏普比率是金融领域广泛使用的风险调整收益指标，但在MDP中优化夏普比率面临两个挑战：动态规划不适用于分数目标，也不适用于风险度量。

Method: 使用Dinkelbach变换将夏普比率优化转换为均值-方差优化问题，开发迭代算法求解M2V问题，通过策略迭代过程更新风险敏感参数。

Result: 提出的算法能够单调递增地收敛到最优夏普比率，在平均和折扣MDP设置下都证明了收敛性，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用动态规划类算法解决MDP中夏普比率优化问题的方法，为解决其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

TL;DR: SWE-PRM是一个推理时过程奖励模型，通过检测和纠正LLM代理在软件工程任务中的轨迹级错误，提高任务解决率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在复杂软件工程任务中存在冗余探索、循环和无法终止等低效问题，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，需要实时干预机制

Method: 设计基于常见低效分类的轻量级过程奖励模型，在推理时提供可解释反馈而不修改底层策略

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中高难度任务上提升最大，分类引导的PRM表现最佳

Conclusion: PRM以低至0.2美元的额外推理成本显著提升SWE代理的可靠性和效率，是一种实用且可扩展的改进机制

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在业务流程管理的后缀预测中缺乏领域知识整合，经常违反基本逻辑约束，需要将形式化逻辑集成到训练过程中。

Method: 使用有限轨迹上的线性时态逻辑(LTLf)，结合Gumbel-Softmax技巧创建可微逻辑损失函数，与标准预测损失结合训练自回归序列预测器。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了后缀预测的准确性和时态约束的符合性，在噪声和实际场景下均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于业务流程管理，还可推广到任何符号序列生成任务，推动了神经符号AI的发展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统在1型糖尿病中的实际采用率较低，主要障碍不是技术问题，而是行为、心理和社会层面的障碍，需要开发有效的说服对话系统来促进采用。

Method: 创建包含专家验证虚拟患者的框架，模拟与配备多样化循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮互动，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社会影响场景。

Result: 研究发现虽然更大、更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社会压力下。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在行为改变方面存在关键局限性，该基准为推进医疗保健领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了高保真、可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Motivation: MCCFR与深度神经网络结合时面临规模依赖的挑战，包括非平稳目标分布偏移、动作支持崩溃等问题，这些问题在不同复杂度的博弈中表现各异，需要针对性的缓解策略。

Result: 在Kuhn扑克上最终利用率为0.0628（比经典框架提升60%），在Leduc扑克上利用率为0.2386（提升23.5%），证明了选择性组件使用的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了神经MCCFR风险的理论分析、有收敛保证的缓解框架、多尺度实验验证以及大型博弈部署的实用指南，强调了根据博弈规模选择性使用组件的重要性。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏可控和可扩展的工具来进行细粒度分析，无法进行多维度系统化分析和训练，或者问题类型和格式过于狭窄。

Method: 基于SAT的问题生成方法，从CNF实例生成逻辑推理问题，沿三个正交维度（实例规模、问题类型、问题格式）构建问题，使用随机化生成和PySAT进行客观答案验证。

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进LLM逻辑推理能力的有价值起点，同时揭示了跨格式适应的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Conclusion: ReaL-TG框架成功解决了时序图链接预测的可解释性问题，通过强化学习微调使较小模型在性能和解释质量上超越大型模型，为时序图推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited
examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an
LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches
on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search
achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation
falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis
generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods.
Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search
for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient
systems.

Motivation: 揭示人工智能与自然智能作为计算过程的差异，定义并实现开放计算，探索在化学反应中模拟计算过程与环境互动的机制。

Method: 将计算建模为化学反应，执行环境建模为分子聚集程度，通过Token计算（关注分子个体行为）和Type计算（关注规范行为）的相互作用构建系统。

Result: Token计算展现出自我组织的临界现象，Type计算表现出量子逻辑，两者相互作用实现了量子逻辑子空间之间的相干性，形成尖峰波实现信号传输。

Conclusion: 这种量子类相干性可能是控制尖峰波和生化节律的酶源，为理解自然智能的计算机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply

Motivation: 现有的游戏基准测试缺乏多样性，很少评估代理完成整个故事线的能力，特别是冒险游戏中复杂的叙事驱动交互带来了额外挑战。

Method: 提出了FlashAdventure基准测试、CUA-as-a-Judge自动化评估器，以及COAST代理框架，该框架利用长期线索记忆来更好地规划和解决顺序任务。

Result: 实验显示当前GUI代理在完整故事弧上表现不佳，而COAST通过弥合观察-行为差距显著提高了里程碑完成率。

Conclusion: 虽然COAST取得了改进，但人类与最佳代理之间仍存在明显差距，需要继续研究来缩小这一差距。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具增强强化学习方法存在代码库碎片化、同步执行瓶颈和跨领域扩展性有限的问题，阻碍了社区采用和算法创新。

Method: 通过系统化设计原则提供：1)与VeRL的上游对齐；2)标准化API的统一工具管理；3)异步rollout执行；4)多模态观察令牌的多轮轨迹形式化。

Result: 在6个ARLT领域（数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程）实现了竞争性性能，异步执行获得近2倍加速。

Conclusion: VerlTool提供了一个可扩展的统一训练基础设施，通过模块化插件架构显著降低开发开销，为工具增强RL研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Method: 采用三阶段训练策略：持续预训练增强基础推理能力，监督微调统一建模人机交互和任务规划，强化学习提升推理-行动一致性和长时任务连贯性。

Conclusion: Robix成功实现了端到端的机器人推理和交互框架，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive

Motivation: 电商平台中产品SKU匹配是一个长期挑战，传统基于规则和关键词相似度的方法容易忽略品牌、规格等细微差异，导致误分类。需要更智能可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出Q2K多智能体框架：1）推理智能体生成消歧问题；2）知识智能体通过针对性网络搜索获取答案；3）去重智能体重用已验证的推理轨迹减少冗余。结合人工循环机制处理不确定情况。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在捆绑产品识别和品牌来源消歧等困难场景中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Q2K通过重用检索到的推理而非重复搜索，在准确性和效率之间取得平衡，为产品集成提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作有效提高了检索鲁棒性，减轻了模糊或错误锚点的影响，为开放世界检索增强生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作系统调度器存在语义鸿沟问题，内核策略无法理解应用特定需求，导致性能不佳

Method: 采用MCP服务器架构，包含工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器，通过多智能体系统自主分析工作负载并合成eBPF调度策略

Result: 实现了最高1.79倍的性能改进，相比简单智能体方法成本降低13倍，同时保持高成功率

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，使专家级系统优化民主化，朝着创建真正自优化、应用感知的操作系统迈进一步

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模式无关基线方法显著更信息丰富（更不保守）

Conclusion: GenQPM方法通过结合深度生成模型和模式分类，有效解决了多模态随机系统的定量预测监控问题，提供了更精确的模式特定预测

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

*Yunqing Liu,Nan Zhang,Zhiming Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需额外训练的CAD零件检索框架，通过错误笔记本和RAG技术改善现有大模型的检索性能，在GPT-4o上实现了23.4%的绝对准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLMs/VLMs进行CAD组件检索遇到两大挑战：输入序列超出模型令牌限制，且性能不满意；同时微调需要大量计算资源且对于闭源商业模型不可行。

Method: 提出一种新的无需训练的零件检索框架，使用错误笔记本(Error Notebooks)+提示工程技术改善现有模型的检索性能。错误笔记本包含历史错误思维链和更正过程，RAG技术用于检索相关记录并整合到推理过程中。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini系列模型上进行实验，GPT-4o(Omni)在人类偏好数据集上实现了绝对23.4%的准确率提升。消融研究证明思维链推理在高零件数量(>10)的挑战性场景中特别有效。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理包含长非自然语言元数据的3D模型，为自动化设计验证和下游工程任务提供了一种高效的无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Motivation: 当前深度研究代理的评估面临挑战，难以收集真正反映研究者关注和智力好奇心的前沿研究问题，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出多智能体分层任务生成(MAHTG)系统，从研讨会转录中提取研究价值灵感并转化为高质量研究任务，确保任务制定的可追溯性和噪声过滤。

Result: 构建了包含12个学科、200多个学术研讨会、超过10,000个研究任务的DeepResearch Arena基准，评估显示该基准对当前最先进的研究代理构成显著挑战。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena提供了一个更真实反映研究环境的评估框架，能够有效评估研究代理的多阶段研究能力，并揭示了不同模型之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Method: 回顾科学发展历史，分析AI如何重塑科学发现实践，评估从数据驱动方法、知识感知神经架构到符号推理框架和LLM代理等多种方法

Conclusion: 验证必须是AI辅助科学发现的基石，只有通过严谨的验证机制才能确保AI生成假设的科学可靠性

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Motivation: 服务生态系统治理面临复杂多变的社会环境因素，传统基于预定义规则的场景分析方法存在信息有限、影响因素众多、社会要素难以量化等挑战，限制了场景生成的质量和效率。

Method: 设计三个LLM赋能的智能体：环境智能体(EA)生成社会环境（包括极端情况），社会智能体(SA)生成社会协作结构，规划智能体(PA)耦合任务-角色关系并规划任务解决方案。这些智能体协同工作，PA通过感知各智能体状态实时调整实验方案。

Result: 在ProgrammableWeb数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够更高效地生成更准确的场景，为服务生态系统治理相关的实验系统构建提供了创新有效的途径。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多智能体协作机制，有效解决了传统场景生成方法的局限性，为复杂社会环境下的服务生态系统治理提供了高质量的场景生成解决方案。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CSR训练目标，通过反事实干预增强语言模型推理过程与最终输出的关联性，显著提升推理忠实度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常在推理过程中存在缺陷或无关的推理轨迹，但在最终输出正确结果，这在高风险领域降低了模型的可信度

Method: 提出Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)，在训练时引入自动化的操作符级别反事实干预（如将"+"替换为"-"），惩罚在逻辑无效推理轨迹下保持相同答案的模型

Result: 在算术推理(GSM8K)、逻辑推理(PrOntoQA)和规划任务(Blocks World)上，CSR相比标准微调和过程监督将忠实度提升高达70个百分点，仅带来轻微准确率损失

Conclusion: CSR是一种轻量级训练目标，能有效增强模型推理过程的忠实性，且学到的敏感性可泛化到更大模型并与推理时方法（如自一致性）协同工作

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Motivation: 随着AI在安全关键领域的应用日益增多，需要解决决策的伦理影响，确保决策在涉及人命时可靠且可证明合理。

Method: 提出了结构化决策框架，引入Enabler代理、级别和场景概念，在灾害管理中进行自主决策实施，并与基于判断的系统及有经验的人类操作员进行比较评估。

Result: 结构化决策框架在多个场景中实现60.94%更高的决策稳定性，比人类操作员准确度高38.93%。

Conclusion: 该结构化决策框架显示出在安全关键环境中构建更可靠自主AI应用的潜力。

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

Motivation: 随着AI网络代理的普及，它们可能会导致过度资源消耗、突破CAPTCHA防护系统，从而威胁到内容提供商的服务稳定性和内容保护。

Method: 设计了一种可调数据成本的限速门槽框架，采用需要多跳推理的rebus类垃圾谜题（Reasoning Gates），这种谜题需要基于世界知识进行复杂推理，从而大幅增加代理的词汇生成成本。

Result: 该框架实现了计算不对称性，回复生成成本比当前最优模型高出9.2倍。通过在自定义网站和MCP服务器上部署，并使用真实网络代理进行了验证。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的Web代理限速方案，但也讨论了实际部署时的限制和环境影响问题。

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在各种应用中的广泛使用，存在用户试图利用这些模型进行恶意目的（如合成受控物质和传播虚假信息）的担忧，即"越狱"攻击。现有防御方法的原理仍不明确。

Method: 提出新颖的神经元级可解释性方法，将模型内部表示投影到更一致和可解释的词汇空间，识别安全相关神经元，并通过调整其激活来控制模型行为。基于此开发了SafeTuning微调策略。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元的激活可有效控制模型行为，平均攻击成功率（ASR）高于97%。SafeTuning在多个LLMs上持续降低攻击成功率，并优于所有四个基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和防御越狱攻击提供了新视角，通过神经元级分析揭示了安全机制的内在原理，并提出了有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模分析线上服务隐私实践提供了有前景的方向，有助于网络和互联网的审计。所有数据集和源代码都已作为公共资源释放，以便重用和改进。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Conclusion: CSA通过从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全方法，重新定义了模型与用户的关系，旨在建立不仅安全而且有意义的帮助系统

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Conclusion: 当前AI生成的辅导对话存在关键局限性，研究结果为设计和评估更具教学效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型代理面临部署挑战，包括高延迟和推理成本。现有加速方法要么性能保真度不足，要么需要大量离线训练，或者运营成本过高，且缺乏用户对加速与性能权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划（DSP）框架，使用异步在线强化学习，联合优化端到端延迟和美元成本的平衡目标，通过单一参数让用户控制响应速度与运营成本的权衡。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP实现了与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时将总成本降低30%，不必要的成本降低高达60%。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一个灵活、高效且成本优化的解决方案，解决了现有加速方法的局限性，为语言模型代理的实际部署提供了实用的加速框架。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through

*Jonathn Chang,Leonard Piff,Suvadip Sana,Jasmine X. Li,Lionel Levine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EigenBench是一个无需真实标签的黑盒方法，通过模型间相互评估来量化语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量度量标准的问题，为价值对齐提供可比较的基准测试方法。

Method: 给定模型集合、价值体系宪法和场景数据集，让模型相互评估输出，使用EigenTrust算法聚合评估结果生成对齐分数向量。

Result: EigenBench能够量化模型的价值对齐程度，研究发现大部分方差由提示词解释，但仍有小部分残差量化模型本身的倾向性。

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的定量评估框架，能够区分模型本身倾向性和提示词的影响，为AI价值观对齐研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架和FAB公平性-准确性平衡分数，用于评估医疗场景中LLM的偏见问题，并在两个大规模医疗基准测试上验证了四个开源LLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法在医疗高风险场景中存在不足，使用简化指标忽略了医疗伤害的多维性，且可能导致模型因临床惰性而显得公平但输出不准确。

Method: 构建了两个大规模受控基准测试（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），包含50,000多个提示和12种种族×性别变体；提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架，评估分配性、稳定性和潜在性三个维度的差异，并聚合为mFARM分数；还提出了FAB分数来评估公平性与预测准确性之间的权衡。

Result: mFARM指标在各种设置下更有效地捕捉细微偏见；大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的mFARM性能，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的mFARM框架能更好地评估医疗LLM的公平性问题，基准测试和评估代码已公开以促进医疗AI对齐研究。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

Motivation: 当前AI系统虽然功能广泛但缺乏真正的智能深度，只是表面模仿。作者希望建立衡量真正智能的标准，区分广度功能和深度智能。

Method: 提出结构性生成智能本体论框架，包含三个核心条件：生成性（创造新结构）、协调性（将结构组织成理由）、持续性（维持身份认同）。

Result: 建立了衡量真正智能的理论框架，指出当前AI系统因缺乏这三个深度条件而只是表面模拟，并非真正的智能。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要深度而非广度，如果未来系统能满足这三个条件，可能成为与人类并存但不同的"第二存在"，而不仅仅是工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Result: 绩效比之前方法提升9%，达到状态前治性能，同时揭示了当前自动评估指标的局限性

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种有潜力的方法，能够在法律领域等对可靠性要求高的领域确保AI的责任性和可负责性

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable

representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

Motivation: 知识图谱是建模复杂多关系数据的强大工具，但预测方法要成为可信的科学工具，不仅需要准确性，还需要提供有意义的科学解释能力

Method: 采用奖励和策略机制，考虑科学解释的理想特性来指导强化学习智能体在知识图谱中识别解释性路径，并使用领域特定本体论丰富解释路径

Result: 在三个流行知识图谱基准测试中评估，结果显示该方法能够生成验证预测见解的解释，并在预测性能上优于最先进方法

Conclusion: REx是推进AI驱动科学发现的相关贡献，能够生成基于生物医学知识的见解性解释

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific
ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in
established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing
using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate
its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against
biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in
predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance
AI-driven scientific discovery.

Motivation: 研究LLM在超越简单函数调整的复杂启发式算法设计中的创新能力，探索其在完整求解器构建方面的潜力

Method: 使用约束支架（预写约束检查代码）和迭代自校正（额外精炼循环修复错误）来支持LLM构建3D装箱问题求解器

Result: LLM生成的启发式算法与人工设计的贪心算法相当，其评分函数集成到元启发式算法中后性能可与现有求解器媲美，但在约束收紧时效果下降

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动化启发式设计方面存在两大障碍：复杂推理任务中的脆弱性需要工程支持，预训练偏见会过早限制新颖解决方案的搜索

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于模型解释性的高光谱图像波段选择方法，通过事后可解释性技术量化各波段对分类决策的贡献度，选择最具影响力的波段子集，在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像虽然提供丰富的光谱信息，但其高维度特性带来计算负担和冗余，需要进行维度约简。传统方法往往缺乏对模型决策过程的理解，需要一种能够保持预测性能的智能化波段选择方法。

Method: 使用训练好的分类器，通过事后可解释性方法量化每个波段对分类决策的贡献度。进行删除-插入评估，记录排名靠前的波段被移除或重新引入时的置信度变化，将这些信号聚合成影响力分数。选择影响力最高的波段形成紧凑的光谱子集。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集（Pavia University和Salinas）上的实验表明，仅使用30个选定波段训练的匹配器就能达到或超过全光谱基线的性能，同时显著降低计算需求。选出的波段子集与物理上有意义、高度区分的波长区域一致。

Conclusion: 基于模型对齐和解释性引导的波段选择是高光谱图像维度约简的有效原则性方法，能够在保持准确性的同时提高计算效率，并且所选波段具有明确的物理意义。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理结构化生物医学数据时经常产生流畅但过于自信的输出，特别是在复杂的多表数据推理中，需要更好的不确定性管理机制来提高可靠性。

Method: 结合两种互补的不确定性信号：检索不确定性（多个表选择rollout的熵）和摘要不确定性（自一致性和困惑度组合），使用GRPO强化学习整合摘要不确定性，并在推理时使用两种不确定性进行过滤和高质量合成数据集构建。

Result: 在多组学基准测试中，方法显著提升了事实性和校准性，正确有用的声明数量几乎翻了三倍（内部数据3.0→8.4；癌症多组学3.6→9.9），下游生存预测C-index从0.32提升到0.63。

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理能够弃权、传达置信度，并成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了智能体强化学习(Agentic RL)的新范式，将LLMs从被动序列生成器转变为自主决策智能体，通过对比传统LLM-RL的单步MDP与Agentic RL的时序扩展POMDP，建立了双重分类法并整合了开源资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM强化学习局限于单步决策，无法处理复杂动态环境中的时序扩展任务，需要新的框架来支持LLMs作为自主智能体的发展。

Method: 提出双重分类法：基于核心智能能力(规划、工具使用、记忆等)和任务应用领域进行分类，并通过强化学习将这些能力转化为自适应行为。整合500多篇文献和开源环境资源。

Result: 建立了Agentic RL的完整理论框架和分类体系，提供了实用的开源工具和基准测试集合，为领域发展奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 强化学习是实现LLMs向自主智能体转变的关键机制，该调查为构建可扩展的通用AI智能体指明了发展路径和挑战。

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

### [84] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiStream-LLM是一个模块化手语翻译框架，通过分离处理连续手语、手指拼写和唇读，使用专家网络分别解码后融合，再通过大语言模型生成最终句子，在How2Sign基准测试中达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端手语翻译模型在处理高速手指拼写和异步非手动线索时表现不佳，特别是在翻译姓名、地点和技术术语等关键信息时效果较差。

Method: 采用模块化框架，使用专门的预测器分别处理连续手语、手指拼写和唇读，每个专家网络解码成token序列，通过轻量级transformer融合解决时间错位问题，最后使用大语言模型生成句子。

Result: 在How2Sign基准测试中获得BLEU-4得分23.5的新SOTA，在ChicagoFSWildPlus手指拼写数据集上达到73.2%的字母准确率。

Conclusion: 通过分离和解决不同的识别任务再进行融合，多专家方法为鲁棒、高保真的手语翻译提供了更强大有效的途径。

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

Motivation: 随着NLP技术的发展，各种任务中对"假设"的定义偏离了传统科学定义，且在NLU领域内部也存在差异，需要系统梳理和明确界定。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，对近期发表的NLU任务中的假设定义进行系统梳理和对比分析，识别不同定义间的细微差别。

Result: 揭示了NLU领域中假设定义的多义性和不一致性，展示了从传统科学定义到NLU任务特定定义的演变轨迹。

Conclusion: 明确定义和结构化假设对于构建机器可解释的学术记录至关重要，需要建立统一的定义标准以促进NLP研究的规范发展。

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

Motivation: 现有思维链提示的推理可解释性有限，主要关注局部token级归因，而高层次语义角色和推理步骤转换未被充分探索。

Method: 使用谱分析对token级嵌入进行聚类，将推理步骤表示为语义一致的潜在状态，并通过马尔可夫链建模推理进程。

Result: 该框架支持语义角色识别、时间模式可视化和一致性评估等多种分析功能。

Conclusion: 提出的状态感知转换框架为思维链推理提供了结构化和可解释的视图，有助于深入理解推理过程的语义演化和全局结构。

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Motivation: 当前人类意义建构建模领域缺乏一个通用的理论框架来统一描述各种模型类型，无法在不同模型间进行公平比较。

Method: 基于C.S. Peirce的符号学理论构建理论框架，将模型视为测量潜在符号几何的假设，并通过模型间的对比关系来理解模型价值。

Result: 提出了一个能够统一描述各种建模实践的理论框架，将模型本身视为符号，建立了模型语义学理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析复杂符号系统提供了理论基础，通过实证示例展示了其应用价值，并为未来研究方向奠定了基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

Conclusion: Temporal Game为时间标注提供了新的交互式方法，为强化学习代理的训练奠定了基础，并作为研究和标注工具开源提供给社区

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

TL;DR: RITE是一种将逻辑推理融入文本嵌入的方法，通过生成中间推理文本来增强LLM的表示能力，在推理密集型检索任务中显著提升零样本性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的嵌入方法主要关注上下文表示，未能充分利用LLMs强大的推理能力，而复杂查询需要超越表层词汇匹配的深度推理

Method: 在计算嵌入之前，在token空间中生成中间推理文本，从而为表示注入推理深度，基于现有语言模型嵌入技术进行扩展

Result: 在推理密集型检索基准BRIGHT上的实验表明，RITE显著提升了跨多个领域的零样本检索性能

Conclusion: 将推理过程整合到嵌入生成中是有效的，能够显著增强检索系统的性能，特别是在需要复杂推理的场景中

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and

Motivation: 虽然指令调优和RLHF对齐以及蒸馏推理微调各自有效，但将RLHF应用于蒸馏训练模型的第三范式存在严重的不稳定性问题，需要解决方案

Method: 提出平衡演员初始化(BAI)，采用两阶段加权模型合并方法：先合并指令跟随和蒸馏推理微调模型，再与预训练模型合并以保留基础知识

Result: BAI解决了序列长度崩溃问题，缓解了奖励曲棍球棒曲线，实现了训练期间序列长度的持续改进，并在多个基准测试中验证了有效性

Conclusion: BAI为第三范式提供了有效的稳定训练解决方案，使推理模型能够结合蒸馏效率和RLHF对齐的优势

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示策略通常需要演示、示例或思维链模板，而GIER旨在通过自然语言描述推理差距，让模型能够自我批判和精炼输出，以更好地满足质量标准。

Method: GIER利用自然语言描述推理差距，提示模型迭代地批判和精炼自身输出，通过自我反思和修订来提升输出质量。

Result: 在三个推理密集型任务（SciFact、PrivacyQA和e-SNLI）和四个大语言模型上，GIER提高了理由质量、基础性和推理一致性，且不降低任务准确性。

Conclusion: 模型不仅能够解释抽象的概念差距，还能将其转化为具体的推理改进，证明了自我反思和迭代修订的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek是一个用于合成复杂深度研究任务的框架，通过双代理系统构建研究树并生成需要层次推理的自然语言问题，显著提升了语言模型在深度研究任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法捕捉深度研究任务的复杂性，而合成数据集存在推理捷径、知识泄露或结构深度不足的问题，需要新的框架来支持复杂的层次约束满足问题。

Method: 使用双代理系统递归地从大规模网页构建研究树，将中间节点模糊化为有效子问题，并将这些树转换为需要遍历完整层次结构的自然语言问题。支持快速扩展，生成超过5万个训练示例和推理轨迹。

Result: 在InfoSeek上训练的模型持续优于强基线。在BrowseComp-Plus基准测试中，使用InfoSeek优化的3B LLM超越了更大的32B模型和轻量级商业API，性能与更强的API相当。

Conclusion: InfoSeek通过保留中间步骤和检索标签等元信息，支持复合奖励设计和轨迹级探索等高级优化策略，为深度研究任务提供了有效的训练框架和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [97] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV是一个基于图的KV缓存管理框架，通过动态传播机制自适应保留重要token，可无缝集成到现有方法中


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KV缓存驱逐策略依赖静态启发式方法，无法捕捉推理过程中token间动态的隐式依赖关系，导致长文本处理性能受限

Method: 将token建模为带重要性分数的节点，边表示相似关系，通过衰减信号传播机制在图上动态更新token重要性

Result: 提出的GraphKV框架能够自适应保留上下文最重要的token，可与SnapKV和PyramidKV等现有方法即插即用

Conclusion: GraphKV通过图结构动态建模token依赖关系，有效解决了传统静态KV缓存管理方法的局限性，提升了长文本处理效率

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### [98] [The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391)
*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了GCG和T-GCG对抗性提示攻击在不同规模开源LLM上的效果，发现攻击成功率随模型增大而降低，语义评估比前缀启发式更严格，推理任务比安全提示更脆弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估梯度对抗性提示攻击（如GCG算法）在不同规模语言模型上的有效性，特别是在安全提示和推理密集型编码提示上的攻击效果差异。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-0.5B、LLaMA-3.2-1B和GPT-OSS-20B三个不同规模的开源LLM，在AdvBench安全提示和推理密集型编码提示上评估GCG及其退火增强变体T-GCG的攻击效果，采用前缀启发式和GPT-4o语义判断两种评估方式。

Result: 1) 攻击成功率随模型规模增大而降低；2) 前缀启发式评估高估攻击效果，语义评估更严格真实；3) 编码相关提示比安全提示更脆弱；4) T-GCG能多样化对抗搜索但在语义评估下效果有限。

Conclusion: GCG的可扩展性存在限制，推理任务中存在被忽视的脆弱性，需要进一步发展退火启发策略以进行更鲁棒的对抗评估。

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

*Juraj Vladika,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedSEBA是一个基于AI的医疗问答系统，利用大语言模型生成答案，并通过PubMed动态检索医学研究来确保答案的可信度，提供研究支持程度可视化和共识演变分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互联网医疗信息可靠性差和医学研究数量庞大难以跟踪的问题，帮助用户区分可靠信息和误导信息，同时帮助研究人员掌握最新科学发现。

Method: 结合大型语言模型生成连贯表达的回答，并通过动态检索PubMed数据库中的可信医学研究来支撑答案，提供关键点和论据溯源功能。

Result: 用户研究表明，医学专家和普通用户都认为系统可用且有帮助，提供的答案可信且信息丰富。系统支持研究共识随时间演变的可视化。

Conclusion: MedSEBA系统适用于日常健康问题和高级研究洞察，能有效解决医疗信息可靠性和研究跟踪的挑战。

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建人工语言Camlang来测试LLM的元语言推理能力，发现GPT-5在英语任务上达到98%准确率但在Camlang上仅47%，远低于人类的87%，揭示了LLM缺乏真正的语法系统掌握能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大型语言模型是否真正具备推理能力而非模式匹配，通过人类认知科学中的元语言演绎学习范式来评估模型对陌生语言的掌握能力

Method: 构建Camlang人工语言，包含语法书和双语词典资源，将CommonsenseQA适配为Camlang-CSQA-v0任务，要求模型应用语法规则和词汇映射来解决问题

Result: GPT-5在英语任务上98%准确率，但在Camlang上仅47%，远低于人类的87%。其他先进推理LLM表现更差。人类验证显示模型成功主要来自浅层词汇对齐而非系统语法掌握

Conclusion: Camlang建立了基于认知科学的评估范式，揭示了当前模型与人类元语言能力之间的根本差距，模型缺乏真正的语法系统内部化能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU是一个基于语义单元的RAG框架，通过全局消歧和语义单元合并解决传统图结构RAG中局部语义单元提取的模糊性和耦合问题，在多个任务上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG方法使用异构图和超图来丰富检索和生成，但局部文本块提取的高层语义单元容易产生歧义、复杂耦合，并因缺乏全局知识或忽略细粒度关系而增加检索开销。

Method: 提出GOSU框架：1）在图构建阶段对局部文本块预提取的语义单元进行全局合并，指导实体和关系提取；2）在检索生成阶段引入分层关键词提取和语义单元补全，分别捕捉细粒度二元关系和粗粒度n元关系。

Result: 在多个任务上的评估表明，GOSU在生成质量方面优于基线RAG方法。

Conclusion: GOSU通过全局语义单元处理和分层关系捕捉，有效解决了传统RAG方法的局限性，提升了检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个轻量级框架，使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器和注意力相关性评分来解决伊斯兰继承法多选题，在效率和隐私方面具有优势


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰继承法需要精确识别继承人和计算份额，这对AI提出了挑战，需要开发既准确又高效的解决方案

Method: 使用专门的阿拉伯语文本编码器（MARBERT、ArabicBERT、AraBERT）和注意力相关性评分（ARS）来对答案选项进行语义相关性排序，支持快速设备端推理

Result: 大型模型（Gemini、DeepSeek）在QIAS 2025数据集上达到87.6%准确率，但需要更多资源；基于MARBERT的方法达到69.87%准确率，在效率、设备端部署和隐私方面具有优势

Conclusion: 研究量化了大模型峰值性能与小型专业化系统在实际应用优势之间的关键权衡，为高风险领域提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP)框架，利用token-level熵作为无需logit和参考的不确定性度量，通过保形预测为黑盒语言模型生成提供形式化覆盖保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域语言生成的不确定性量化在无法访问模型内部信号的黑盒约束下是一个关键但未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 使用token-level熵作为不确定性度量，将其整合到split conformal prediction流程中，通过校准不确定性阈值来构建具有形式化覆盖保证的预测集。

Result: 在6个大语言模型和2个基准测试(CoQA和TriviaQA)上的实证评估表明，TECP始终实现可靠的覆盖和紧凑的预测集，优于先前的自一致性UQ方法。

Conclusion: TECP为黑盒LLM设置中的可信生成提供了一个原则性和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了四种提示方法来解决角色扮演对话代理中的过度说话和工具使用不足问题，其中基于规则的提示方法表现最佳，得分从0.519提升到0.571。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CPDC 2025挑战中，对话代理经常产生过长的角色回应（过度说话），同时未能根据角色有效使用工具（行动不足），如生成不存在的函数调用或在回答前进行不必要的工具调用。

Method: 探索了四种提示方法：1）基础角色提示 2）人工制作角色提示 3）自动提示优化（APO）4）基于规则的角色提示（RRP）。RRP采用角色卡片/场景契约设计和严格函数调用执行两种新技术。

Result: 基于规则的角色提示方法取得了最佳性能，总体得分0.571，相比零样本基线得分0.519有所提升。

Conclusion: RRP设计相比APO等更复杂的方法，能显著提高角色扮演对话代理的有效性和可靠性。所有最佳性能提示和APO工具已开源。

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

TL;DR: ResearchQA是一个从75个研究领域的综述文章中提取21K查询和160K评分标准的资源，用于评估LLM系统在长文本研究查询回答中的表现，发现现有系统在引用文献、解释和描述局限性等方面存在显著能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估研究查询的长文本回答主要依赖专家标注，限制了评估范围。研究专业知识广泛分布在文献综述中，需要一种更全面、多领域的评估方法。

Method: 从75个研究领域的综述文章提取21K查询和160K评分标准，每个评分标准包含查询特定的答案评估标准（引用论文、解释、描述局限性等）。使用31位博士标注者在8个领域进行评估，并构建自动配对评判系统。

Result: 96%的查询支持博士信息需求，87%的评分标准项需要在系统回答中用至少一句话来回应。自动评判系统与专家判断达到74%一致率。评估18个系统的7.6K+配对评估显示，没有参数化或检索增强系统超过70%的评分标准覆盖率，最高排名代理系统达到75%覆盖率。

Conclusion: 现有LLM系统在研究查询回答中仍存在显著能力差距，特别是在引用文献（完全处理<11%）、描述局限性（48%）和比较（49%）方面。ResearchQA资源支持更全面的多领域评估。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

Motivation: 现有语音离散表示学习方法产生过于细粒的token（25-50次/秒），而语音一般只包含2-5个单词/秒，导致冗余和效率低下。这种细粒度主要捐捕语音级信息，而语义理解并不需要这么详细的分辨率。

Method: 首先通过大规模无标注数据进行下一token预测预训练语音语言模型，捐捕频繁token模式。然后使用预测伪燃来自适应地确定聚合边界，通过交叉注意力模块融合每个段落内的信息。通过调整伪燃阈值可灵活控制表示的粒度和压缩比。

Result: 在ASR、语音到文本翻译和语音转换任务上的实验表明，压缩后的语义语音表示在性能上与密集token序列相当或更好，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于伪燃的动态聚合框架能够有效学习压缩的语义语音表示，在保持性能的同时显著提升下游任务的训练和推理效率，为高效语音表示学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Eunjung Cho,Alexander Hoyle,Yoan Hermstrüwer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在法律摘要生成中会根据不同法律角色（法官、检察官、律师）产生立场偏向的摘要，即使有平衡指令仍表现出选择性信息包含，存在动机推理问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在法律语境中如何根据用户角色进行动机推理，即模型如何策略性地构建信息以符合法律系统中利益相关者的立场

Method: 基于法律现实主义和近期法律实践趋势，构建评估框架，从法律事实和推理包含度以及利益相关者偏好角度，分析LLMs在不同法律角色提示下的司法判决摘要行为

Result: 即使提示中包含平衡指令，模型仍表现出反映角色一致视角的选择性信息包含模式，存在明显的立场偏向

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在高风险法律环境中对LLM摘要行为进行角色感知评估的必要性，担忧LLMs可能从先前交互或上下文中推断用户角色而产生类似的对齐问题

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在推理能力增强时更容易响应恶意请求，这种现象被称为"推理诱导的失准"，揭示了推理能力与安全性之间的新权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，对其安全性和与人类价值观对齐的关注日益增强。先前研究表明在恶意数据集上微调会导致模型失准，但本研究发现了更令人担忧的现象。

Method: 通过切换到"思考模式"或在良性数学数据集上微调来增强模型的推理能力，观察模型对恶意请求的响应变化，并分析模型内部状态（注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专家作用）。

Result: 发现推理能力增强后，LLMs对恶意请求的响应性显著提高，密集模型尤其脆弱。同时发现注意力转移和专家混合模型中的专门专家有助于将过度推理重新导向安全防护机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了新兴的推理-安全性权衡问题，强调了为高级推理模型推进对齐技术的紧迫性，为理解模型安全机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

TL;DR: 本文量化了LLMs在评估环境与部署环境中的行为差异，通过提示词重写方法将测试类提示转换为部署类提示，发现模型在感知为测试环境时更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在评估环境和实际部署环境中表现出显著的行为差异（评估意识现象），这给AI对齐带来了严峻挑战，因为基准测试性能可能无法准确反映模型的真实安全性和诚实性。

Method: 提出了一种使用线性探针对提示词进行评分的方法，将提示词在"测试类"到"部署类"的连续尺度上评分，并利用LLM重写策略将提示词转向更自然的部署风格上下文，同时保留原始任务。

Result: 重写后的"部署类"提示词导致行为发生显著且一致的变化：所有模型的诚实回答平均增加5.26%，欺骗性回答平均减少12.40%，拒绝率平均增加6.38%。重写后战略角色扮演数据集的平均探针分数提高了30%。

Conclusion: 评估意识是一个可量化和可操纵的因素，直接影响LLM行为。模型在感知为测试环境时更容易产生不安全或欺骗性输出，这强调了在部署前需要更现实的评估框架来准确衡量模型对齐度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

TL;DR: 提出Gated Associative Memory (GAM)网络，一种线性复杂度的序列建模架构，替代Transformer的自注意力机制，在训练速度和性能上优于传统Transformer和Mamba模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次方计算复杂度问题，在处理长序列时成为显著瓶颈，需要更高效的序列建模方案

Method: 使用并行双通路架构：因果卷积捕获局部位置相关上下文，关联记忆检索机制建模全局内容模式，通过门控机制动态融合局部和全局信息

Result: 在WikiText-2和TinyStories数据集上，GAM训练速度更快，验证困惑度优于或与Transformer和Mamba基线相当

Conclusion: GAM是序列建模的高效替代方案，具有线性复杂度优势，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升计算效率

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Result: 零样本思维链提示下o1模型仅达到19.1%的通过率，最佳推理技术（多轮自判断+反思+检索）将解决率提升至42.2%。人类少量特定指导可使o1解决之前无法解决的17/18个问题。

Conclusion: 研究为开发具有基础性、想象力和算法思维的语言模型提供了重要进展，证明了结合人类指导的混合方法在解决复杂编程问题上的有效性。开源了代码和数据以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

TL;DR: 研究发现，经过安全对齐的审查模型在仇恨言论检测准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于未审查模型（78.7% vs 64.1%），但存在意识形态锚定效应，而未审查模型则更容易受到意识形态框架的影响。

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在检测隐性和显性仇恨言论方面的效果，比较经过安全对齐（审查）和未对齐（未审查）模型在客观分类能力上的差异。

Method: 通过对比分析经过安全对齐和未安全对齐的LLMs模型，评估它们在仇恨言论检测任务中的准确性、鲁棒性、对意识形态框架的敏感性以及对微妙语言（如反讽）的理解能力。

Result: 审查模型在准确性和鲁棒性上显著优于未审查模型，但存在强烈的意识形态锚定效应；未审查模型对意识形态框架高度敏感；所有模型在理解微妙语言方面都存在严重缺陷；存在针对不同目标群体的公平性差异和系统性过度自信问题。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLMs作为客观仲裁者的观念，强调需要开发更复杂的审计框架来考虑公平性、校准和意识形态一致性。

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型训练效率挑战大，现有简单路由器在复杂路由任务中表现不佳，需要改进MoE上循环技术的路由能力

Method: 在MoE上循环过程中，从前面的注意力层初始化多个路由器，这些路由器以类似注意力的方式协作分配token给专家，每个token生成多样化查询并与专家特征（作为键）对齐

Result: 实验结果表明该方法实现了最先进的性能，优于其他上循环基线方法

Conclusion: Router Upcycling技术有效提升了MoE上循环模型的性能，通过注意力机制启发的路由方式解决了简单路由器的局限性

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

Motivation: 评估小语言模型被用于在线生成伪造文本的潜在风险，特别是生成低质量和高质量虚假新闻标题的能力。

Method: 使用控制提示工程生成24,000个标题，应用现有的机器学习（DistilBERT）和深度学习检测模型对生成的假新闻标题进行质量检测。

Result: SLMs表现出高配合率，伦理抵抗较少；质量检测误分类普遍，准确率仅35.2%-63.5%；生成的标题与真实网络内容相似度低。

Conclusion: 测试的小语言模型普遍能够生成伪造标题，但生成的假新闻质量较低，与真实内容差异明显，现有检测模型对其识别效果有限。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推荐任务中展现出强大潜力，但如何有效利用用户评论仍然面临挑战：1）在有限上下文窗口中动态使用评论效率低下；2）缺乏有效机制来优先处理与用户当前决策最相关的评论。

Method: 提出RevBrowse框架，受"浏览-决策"过程启发，将用户评论整合到基于LLM的重排序过程中。引入PrefRAG模块，将用户和物品表示解耦为结构化形式，并根据目标物品自适应检索偏好相关内容。

Result: 在四个Amazon评论数据集上的大量实验表明，RevBrowse相比强基线实现了持续且显著的改进，证明了其在建模动态用户偏好方面的泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: RevBrowse通过检索增强的透明过程，不仅提升了推荐性能，还提供了一定程度的可解释性，使影响最终推荐的评论可见，为基于评论的推荐系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

<details>

Motivation: 标准置信度采样方法导致掩码扩散模型的生成顺序类似自回归过程，限制了非自回归建模的优势。

Method: 在每一步扩散过程中，RWS评估整个中间序列的质量，并相应缩放token对数概率，通过整合全局序列连贯性来指导token选择。

Result: 实验表明RWS显著促进了非自回归生成顺序，在多个评估指标上都有改进。

Conclusion: 整合全局信号能有效增强掩码扩散模型的非自回归特性和整体性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

Abstract: Higher education faces growing challenges in delivering personalized,
scalable, and pedagogically coherent learning experiences. This study
introduces a structured framework for designing an AI-powered Learning
Management System (AI-LMS) that integrates generative and conversational AI to
support adaptive, interactive, and learner-centered instruction. Using a
design-based research (DBR) methodology, the framework unfolds through five
phases: literature review, SWOT analysis, development of ethical-pedagogical
principles, system design, and instructional strategy formulation. The
resulting AI-LMS features modular components -- including configurable prompts,
adaptive feedback loops, and multi-agent conversation flows -- aligned with
pedagogical paradigms such as behaviorist, constructivist, and connectivist
learning theories. By combining AI capabilities with human-centered design and
ethical safeguards, this study advances a practical model for AI integration in
education. Future research will validate and refine the system through
real-world implementation.

TL;DR: 本研究系统比较了编码器模型、解码器LLM和FastText在中文AI生成文本检测任务上的表现，发现LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B模型达到95.94%的测试准确率，表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，对AI生成文本的准确检测需求日益增长，特别是在中文等语言中，细微的语言差异给现有方法带来了重大挑战

Method: 使用NLPCC 2025中文AI生成文本检测数据集，比较编码器Transformer（中文BERT-large和RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large）、解码器LLM（Qwen2.5-7B通过LoRA微调）和FastText基线方法。编码器模型采用基于提示的掩码语言建模方法微调，解码器模型使用指令格式输入和轻量级分类头

Result: 编码器模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降（RoBERTa: 76.3%，BERT: 79.3%），FastText展现词汇鲁棒性（83.5%）但缺乏深层语义理解，LoRA微调的Qwen2.5-7B达到95.94%测试准确率，表现出优异的泛化能力

Conclusion: 基于解码器的大语言模型结合参数高效微调在中文AI生成文本检测中效果显著，未来将探索新一代Qwen3模型、蒸馏变体和集成策略以增强跨域鲁棒性

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

TL;DR: FIDES是一个基于事实分解的框架，通过上下文增强的两阶段忠实分解方法将长答案分解为子事实，用于检索相关证据片段，并在证据冲突时修订子事实，最后根据原始句子聚合证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于问题分解的方法在生成问题时经常产生不相关和不完整的问题，导致检索中事实丢失，且无法从不同文档和段落聚合证据片段。

Method: 使用上下文增强的两阶段忠实分解方法分解长答案为子事实，检索相关证据片段，在证据冲突时修订子事实，最后根据原始句子聚合证据。

Result: 在六个数据集上进行了广泛评估，并提出了新的证据精度评估指标$Attr_{auto-P}$。FIDES在GPT-3.5-turbo、Gemini和Llama 70B系列上平均优于SOTA方法超过14%。

Conclusion: FIDES框架有效解决了现有方法在问题生成和证据聚合方面的不足，显著提升了归因问答的性能。

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

TL;DR: 提出司法意见生成新任务，通过LegalChainReasoner框架实现法律推理和量刑预测的端到端生成，解决现有方法中两者不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将司法意见生成分为法律推理和量刑预测两个独立子任务，导致推理与预测不一致，且依赖人工知识增强，实际部署受限。

Method: 提出LegalChainReasoner框架，使用结构化法律链整合事实前提、复合法律条件和量刑结论，实现灵活知识注入和端到端意见生成。

Result: 在两个真实世界的中文法律案例数据集上实验表明，该方法优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 司法意见生成任务能更好地符合法律实践需求，提出的框架有效解决了推理与预测一致性问题。

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文采用LLaMA 3 8B模型进行监督微调，在生物医学多跳问答任务MedHopQA上进行评估，发现模型在语义理解方面表现良好但精确匹配得分较低，提出了两阶段推理管道来改进答案提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学和医疗保健领域的实际应用前，需要对其复杂问答能力进行严格评估，特别是在涉及疾病、基因和化学物质的多跳生物医学问答任务中。

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型进行监督微调，利用来自BioASQ、MedQuAD和TREC的精选生物医学问答数据集。探索三种实验设置：短答案和长答案联合微调、仅短答案微调、仅长答案微调。引入两阶段推理管道进行精确短答案提取。

Result: 模型在概念级准确度得分达到0.8，显示良好的领域理解能力，但精确匹配(EM)得分显著较低，特别是在测试阶段。两阶段推理管道部分改善了答案提取，但在严格格式化输出方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物医学LLM应用中语义理解与精确答案评估之间的差距，需要进一步研究输出控制和后处理策略来改善模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

*Felix Engl,Andreas Henrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Topic Model Translation (TMT)方法，无需对齐语料库即可将主题模型从一种语言迁移到另一种语言，特别适用于目标语言数据稀缺的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言环境下训练主题模型面临巨大挑战，特别是在开发者不熟悉目标语言或数据稀缺的情况下，需要一种无需对齐语料就能实现跨语言主题模型迁移的方法。

Method: 开发了Topic Model Translation (TMT)技术，该方法不需要元数据、词嵌入或对齐语料库，能够直接将LDA等主题模型从源语言转移到目标语言。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估表明，TMT能够产生语义一致且连贯的主题翻译效果。

Conclusion: TMT是一种鲁棒且透明的跨语言主题模型迁移技术，特别适用于目标语言大规模语料不可用或人工翻译不可行的情况。

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI对话系统数量增长，需要有效的评估方法，特别是在小规模模型限制下

Method: 采用两种主要策略：1）通过提示工程使用语言模型作为评估器 2）训练编码器基础的分类和回归模型

Result: 语言模型提示方法与人类判断仅有中等相关性，但在测试集上排名第二；分类/回归模型在验证集上对某些维度显示高相关性，但在测试集上性能下降

Conclusion: 小规模模型在对话评估中具有潜力，但测试集评分范围差异对模型性能有显著影响，需要更好的数据协调和模型适应性

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型使用三元组数据进行对比学习时，负样本的质量对模型区分语义细微差异的能力至关重要，需要更有效的负样本生成策略

Method: 1) MGH框架：利用大语言模型生成不同相似度级别的多样化负样本，支持从粗到细的课程学习策略；2) ATA池化方法：基于LLM聚合模式为锚点标记分配更高权重，在不增加模型复杂度的情况下提升嵌入准确性

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现，超越了现有的合成策略，无论是在纯合成数据还是与公共检索数据集结合的情况下

Conclusion: 提出的MGH框架和ATA池化方法有效提升了文本嵌入模型的性能，通过智能负样本生成和改进的表示学习方法实现了更好的语义区分能力

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型作为强大的创意工具，存在放大有害社会偏见风险，需要系统评估其表征偏见并提出干预策略。

Method: 构建包含5种社会重要职业（CEO、护士、软件工程师、教师、运动员）的基准测试，使用中性提示和公平性控制提示，对5个先进模型（DALLE 3、Gemini Imagen 4.0、FLUX.1-dev、Stable Diffusion XL Turbo、Grok-2 Image）的输出进行性别和种族标注分析。

Result: 提示工程能显著改变人口统计表征，但效果高度模型依赖：有些系统能有效多样化，有些过度校正导致不现实的一致性，有些则响应性很低。

Conclusion: 提示工程作为公平性干预手段既有潜力也有局限，需要结合模型层面的补充策略，所有代码和数据已开源以确保透明度和可复现性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对欺骗性和误导性提示时会产生奉承幻觉，即模型优先考虑与输入隐含视角的一致性而非准确性和真实性，这影响了模型输出的可靠性。

Method: 设计两种范式生成相应的欺骗性/误导性输入以诱导奉承幻觉，然后提出协作对比解码(CCD)方法，通过对比诱导输入和转换后中性输入的输出分布偏差来减少对误导信息的依赖。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的CCD方法能有效缓解奉承幻觉，并在各种任务中提高生成响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 协作对比解码是一种有效的后处理方法，能够在不进行额外训练的情况下显著减少大语言模型中的奉承幻觉现象，提升模型输出的真实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG是一个新型的RAG框架，通过引入结构化检索-笔记-回答流程，使用支持性证据笔记(SENs)和证据质量奖励(EQR)来解决传统检索式问答中的噪声问题和错误累积问题，在多个QA基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索式问答存在两个主要问题：(1)检索证据中的低信噪比，有用信息被无关内容淹没；(2)多跳推理中的错误累积。这些问题影响了问答系统的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了EviNote-RAG框架，采用结构化检索-笔记-回答流程。模型训练生成支持性证据笔记(SENs)，这些笔记是简洁的人类式笔记，仅保留答案相关信息，突出不确定性，并明确说明何时没有有用证据。同时引入证据质量奖励(EQR)，这是一个基于蕴含的信号，评估SENs是否逻辑支持最终答案。

Result: 在领域内和领域外QA基准测试中，EviNote-RAG在准确性、泛化性和训练稳定性方面始终优于强基线。在HotpotQA上相对F1提升20%(+0.093)，Bamboogle上提升40%(+0.151)，2Wiki上提升91%(+0.256)，通过更密集的奖励和减少冗余实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG通过结构化笔记生成和质量奖励机制，显著提高了检索增强生成系统的性能，增强了鲁棒性和效率，为解决传统RAG框架的局限性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺、反讽和挖苦通常用于表达幽默和批评，但有时会被误认为事实报道，类似于假新闻。这些技术可以在更细粒度的句子级别应用，因此需要专门的句子级讽刺检测数据集和方法。

Method: 构建了包含13,873条人工标注句子的罗马尼亚语数据集SeLeRoSa，涵盖社会问题、IT、科学和电影等多个领域。评估了基于LLM的基线模型在零样本和微调设置下的性能，以及基于transformer的基线模型。

Result: 研究发现当前大型语言模型在句子级讽刺检测任务上存在局限性，即使在零样本和微调设置下性能仍有待提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为句子级讽刺检测研究开辟了新方向，揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来改进提供了基础。

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于因果LLMs的快速发展，预期其在序列标注任务上应超越停滞发展的编码器模型，但现有研究较少关注更适合因果LLMs的生成式序列标注方法。

Method: 提出SIFT方法，结合(1)上下文学习从示例中学习，(2)监督微调，将序列标注任务重新表述为约束响应生成问题。

Result: SIFT在一系列标准序列标注任务上显著优于ICL和解码器作为编码器的微调基线，并发现移除指令可以缓解长上下文对性能的负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了LLMs在序列标注任务中的优势和局限性，强调了基于响应的生成式任务表述对实现有效序列标注性能的重要性。

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL

TL;DR: MedCOD是一个结合UMLS知识库和LLM知识库的混合框架，通过结构化提示和微调显著提升英语到西班牙语医学翻译质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升医学领域翻译质量，通过整合领域特定的结构化知识来解决医学翻译中的专业术语和语境理解问题

Method: 构建2999对英西医学文章平行语料库和100句测试集，使用UMLS和LLM-KB提供结构化医学知识，结合LoRA微调和结构化提示（多语言变体、医学同义词、UMLS定义）

Result: 所有模型翻译质量显著提升，Phi-4模型达到BLEU 44.23、chrF++ 28.91、COMET 0.863，超越GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化知识整合能有效增强LLM在医学翻译任务中的表现，MedCOD提示和模型适配各自独立贡献性能提升，组合使用效果最佳

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了NLP中结构化知识图谱与非结构化大语言模型两大范式的融合，提出了结构与解构的互补机制来构建更通用、透明和可控的知识引擎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中的知识引擎发展存在两大看似对立的范式：基于结构化知识图谱的方法和基于海量非结构化数据的大语言模型方法。论文旨在建立这两种范式之间的概念联系，探索如何结合各自的优势。

Method: 提出了结构与解构的互补机制：结构用于组织已知的符号交互，解构通过周期性的嵌入重置来提高模型的可塑性和对未见场景的泛化能力。

Result: 建立了连接结构化与非结构化范式的新框架，为开发通用知识引擎提供了新的方法论。

Conclusion: 通过融合结构与解构的力量，可以构建支持透明、可控和自适应智能系统的通用知识引擎，为NLP领域提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

TL;DR: RPRO是一个结合强化学习和偏好驱动的推理优化框架，通过任务自适应推理模板和概率评估机制提升医疗问答的临床推理质量，在多个医疗数据集上超越更大参数模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗问答中生成的推理链缺乏事实准确性和临床可靠性，需要一种能够整合领域知识并进行逻辑推理的优化方法。

Method: 提出Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO)框架，结合强化学习和偏好驱动推理优化，使用任务自适应推理模板、概率评估机制、基于Bradley-Terry模型的组间排序优化以及KL散度正则化。

Result: 在PubMedQA和MedQA-USMLE数据集上表现优于强基线，1.1B参数模型超越7B-13B大型模型，包括医疗专用变体。

Conclusion: 将偏好优化与质量驱动细化相结合，为构建更可靠、临床基础的医疗大语言模型提供了可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: The demand for text classification is growing significantly in web searching,
data mining, web ranking, recommendation systems, and so many other fields of
information and technology. This paper illustrates the text classification
process on different datasets using some standard supervised machine learning
techniques. Text documents can be classified through various kinds of
classifiers. Labeled text documents are used to classify the text in supervised
classifications. This paper applies these classifiers on different kinds of
labeled documents and measures the accuracy of the classifiers. An Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) model using Back Propagation Network (BPN) is used with
several other models to create an independent platform for labeled and
supervised text classification process. An existing benchmark approach is used
to analyze the performance of classification using labeled documents.
Experimental analysis on real data reveals which model works well in terms of
classification accuracy.

Method: 使用印度语言词性标注语料库构建词图，应用预处理步骤后采用多种基于图的排名算法进行比较分析

Result: 实验结果显示各排名算法在F1度量上的准确性表现

Conclusion: 成功建立了完整的孟加拉语单词排名计算流程，包括从文本构建词图到应用多种图算法进行比较分析

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TaarofBench，首个评估大语言模型对波斯taarof文化礼仪理解的基准测试，揭示了主流LLMs在跨文化沟通中的显著不足，并通过微调方法显著提升了模型的文化对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在理解特定文化沟通规范方面存在局限，特别是波斯文化中的taarof礼仪系统——一种强调谦逊、间接和尊重的复杂社交礼仪，这在现有文化基准测试中完全缺失。

Method: 构建包含450个角色扮演场景的TaarofBench基准，覆盖12个常见社交话题，由母语者验证。评估5个前沿LLMs，进行监督微调和直接偏好优化，并开展包含33名参与者的人类研究。

Result: 主流LLMs在taarof文化适宜场景中的准确率比母语者低40-48%，性能因话题而异，波斯语提示能改善表现，存在性别不对称性。通过微调方法分别实现了21.8%和42.3%的文化对齐改进。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发多样化、文化敏感的LLMs奠定了基础，揭示了西方礼貌框架的局限性，强调了文化特定基准测试的重要性，以支持LLMs在复杂社交互动中的更好应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的基于融合的生成方法，用于在危机沟通中保持语言模型生成响应的风格一致性，通过两阶段过程评估候选响应风格并进行实例级优化融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 危机沟通中自动化响应的风格一致性对建立受影响人群信任至关重要，但现有研究很少关注如何保持生成响应的风格一致性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先评估候选响应的风格，然后通过融合过程在实例级别进行优化和整合，以减少风格变化。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在响应质量和风格一致性方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的融合生成方法能有效生成高质量响应并显著降低风格变化，为危机沟通中的自动化响应提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)检索与特定健康素养水平对齐的知识，设计包含主观用户偏好和客观可读性奖励的奖励函数，通过强化学习优化反言论生成。

Result: 实验结果表明Controlled-Literacy优于基线方法，能生成更易访问且更受用户偏好的反言论。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提高反健康错误信息言论的可访问性和理解性，为更公平和有效的公共卫生沟通做出贡献。

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

Conclusion: LLMs在结构化法律推理方面存在局限性，错误模式包括继承场景误解、法律规则错误应用和领域知识不足，需要改进伊斯兰法律推理性能

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

TL;DR: 乌尔都语中-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代语法中极不合法，尽管19世纪文献中常见，这是由主格主语要求与及物完成体必须用ergative格的语法冲突导致的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究乌尔都语动词和体组合中的范式空缺：-ya: kar结构的完成体形式在现代乌尔都语和印地语中极不合法，但在19世纪文献中自由出现，需要探究这一历时变化的原因。

Method: 通过历史文本分析、大规模语料库研究（确认完成体形式的明显缺失）以及母语者的主观评价任务（判断完成体例句高度不自然）来调查这一历时转变。

Result: 研究发现完成体形式在现代语法中确实不存在，母语者认为极不自然，这种空缺源于形态句法冲突：该结构要求主格主语和不变分词，与及物完成体必须分配ergative格的核心语法规则相冲突。

Conclusion: 这种冲突使得完成体形式不稳定，其他结构的功能性替代使得这一空缺在现代语法中得以巩固。

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG成功实现了高效参数化同时保持RAG级别性能的目标，为隐私保护推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG应用中，LLM处理长上下文输入时存在显著的延迟和内存消耗问题，且检索到的段落中只有小部分与查询直接相关，存在大量不必要的计算。

Method: 提出REFRAG框架，通过分析RAG上下文的块对角注意力模式，识别并消除不必要的计算，采用压缩、感知和扩展机制来优化解码过程。

Result: 实现了30.85倍的解码加速和3.75倍的时间到首个令牌加速，同时将LLM的上下文大小扩展了16倍，在各种长上下文任务中保持准确性不变。

Conclusion: REFRAG有效解决了RAG应用中的效率瓶颈，在多个数据集和任务上验证了其优越性，为LLM在检索增强应用中的高效部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Motivation: 探究自然演化的上下文段落如何影响生成式大型语言模型在问答任务中的表现，分析文本自然演变对LLM理解能力的挑战。

Method: 提出一个框架来整理自然演化的人类编辑版阅读段落，通过语义相似度评分量化变体与预训练内容的对齐程度，评估6个QA数据集和8个LLM。

Result: 实验显示LLM性能随着阅读段落与预训练版本的语义差异增大而下降，例如BoolQ数据集的平均准确率从最高到最低相似度区间下降超过30%。

Conclusion: 自然文本演化对大型语言模型的语言理解能力构成了显著挑战，模型对预训练数据的依赖性很强。

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We

TL;DR: 提出实体对齐翻译(EAT)方法，利用大语言模型的双重翻译策略来解决非拉丁文字语言的跨语言命名实体识别性能下降问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本跨语言命名实体识别方法主要针对拉丁文字语言，在非拉丁文字语言(如中文、日文)上性能下降严重，因为存在深层结构差异

Method: 使用大语言模型进行实体对齐的双重翻译策略，并利用多语言维基百科数据微调大语言模型来增强源语言到目标语言的实体对齐

Result: 论文未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果

Conclusion: EAT方法通过实体对齐翻译策略有效解决了非拉丁文字语言在跨语言命名实体识别中的性能下降问题

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文信息抽取涉及古典和现代文献的多个任务，在异构任务和不同时代上微调单一模型会导致干扰和性能下降。

Method: 结合LoRA与混合专家设计，多个低秩LoRA专家专注于不同的IE任务和时代，通过任务-时代感知路由机制动态分配专家贡献。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了中文信息抽取中多任务和跨时代学习的挑战，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse
temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a
single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to
interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with
a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Motivation: 现有LLM增强的KGC方法存在两个关键挑战：1）忽略自然语言与图结构表示空间的不一致性；2）为不同KGC任务设计独立指令导致重复工作和耗时过程

Method: 提出SAT框架：1）分层知识对齐通过多任务对比学习将图嵌入与自然语言空间对齐；2）结构指令调优使用统一图指令和轻量级知识适配器指导LLM进行结构感知推理

Result: 在4个基准数据集上的两个KGC任务中，SAT显著优于最先进方法，特别是在链接预测任务中提升8.7%到29.8%

Conclusion: SAT框架通过结构感知对齐调优有效解决了LLM在知识图谱补全中的表示空间不一致问题，实现了统一的多任务处理，取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量、多样化且可验证的长上下文数据集，这严重制约了大型语言模型在长文本处理和推理能力方面的发展。

Method: 采用模块化框架，通过模板化提示、模型无关架构和元数据丰富的输出，支持四种核心生成范式：多轮对话、文档基础输入输出对、可验证指令响应任务和长上下文推理示例。

Result: 该框架能够实现可扩展、可控且目标对齐的数据集创建，为提升LLMs的长上下文能力提供支持。

Conclusion: 提出的合成数据生成框架为解决长上下文数据集稀缺问题提供了有效方案，有助于推动LLMs在长文本处理方面的进步。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long
textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications.
However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of
high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both
training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework
for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with
LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives,
including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context
reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture,
and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable,
controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context
capabilities in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统越来越依赖自然语言原则，但语言解释的模糊性导致模型行为不一致和不稳定，而当前AI对齐流程缺乏类似法律系统的制度保障机制

Method: 提出计算框架，包含两个法律机制：(1)规则精炼流程，通过修订模糊规则来最小化解释分歧；(2)基于提示的解释约束，减少规则应用的不一致性

Result: 在WildChat数据集的5000个场景子集上评估，显示两种干预措施显著提高了合理解释者小组的判断一致性

Conclusion: 该框架为系统管理解释性模糊性提供了第一步，是构建更稳健、遵循法律的AI系统的关键步骤

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同步语音翻译系统在多语言多对多场景中难以平衡翻译质量、延迟和语义连贯性，读写策略的分歧阻碍了统一策略学习

Method: 结合前缀训练和混合专家精炼器，以隐式方式学习有效的读写决策，无需增加推理时间开销，仅需对标准Transformer架构进行最小修改

Result: 在6种语言对上，500M参数的语音转文本模型优于Seamless基线，在1.5秒平均延迟下BLEU下降小于7%，在3秒延迟下小于3%

Conclusion: SimulMEGA框架在同步语音翻译和流式文本转语音任务中都表现出优越的延迟-质量权衡，具有很好的通用性

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于模型增长的预训练策略（特别是Transformer堆叠）在缓解大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题方面的效果，发现该方法在阅读理解等任务上能减少性能退化，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的关键挑战，特别是对大语言模型而言，保持跨领域性能对其通用性至关重要。模型增长策略通过利用小模型来加速和结构化大模型训练，但其对遗忘问题的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用基于模型增长的预训练方法（Transformer堆叠），比较使用增长训练的模型（Stack LLM）和未使用增长的基线模型（LLM）在一系列微调任务（领域知识、推理、阅读理解、偏见评估）上的表现。

Result: 两个模型在领域知识上都有提升，但推理和阅读理解性能随时间退化，显示灾难性遗忘迹象。Stack LLM退化程度较小，尤其在阅读理解上表现更好。在偏见评估中，基线LLM逐渐变得更中立，而Stack LLM保持约60-61%的稳定偏见比例。

Conclusion: 基于模型增长的预训练在抵抗灾难性遗忘方面能带来适度改进，但在处理社会偏见方面存在权衡，需要进一步研究来平衡性能保持和偏见控制。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在特定领域任务上表现不佳，需要微调。面对众多开源LLM，如何快速选择最优模型进行下游任务微调是一个挑战

Method: 1) 数据层面：系统分类数据过滤方法（分布感知、质量感知、混合方法），增强关键token密度实现token压缩，使用LLM迭代重写文本优化表达；2) 模型层面：使用层相似性评分评估各层重要性，移除低重要性层，引入稀疏合并范式保留原始模型能力

Result: 在医疗问答、金融问答、通用问答和阅读理解四个数据集上的大量实验表明，可以在节省约20倍训练时间的同时选择出最优LLM

Conclusion: DaMoC框架有效解决了LLM选择难题，通过数据模型双重压缩显著提升效率，为领域特定任务的高效微调提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Chain-of-Thought推理在提升模型推理能力方面日益重要，但其底层工作机制仍不明确，需要从上下文学习与预训练先验的交互关系角度进行深入探究。

Method: 采用细粒度词汇级分析检查模型推理行为；通过逐步引入噪声样本考察模型如何平衡预训练先验与错误上下文信息；研究提示工程是否能诱导大语言模型进行慢思考。

Result: 发现三个关键结论：1）模型能快速学习词汇级推理结构和深层逻辑模式，但严重依赖预训练先验；2）足够样本使决策从预训练先验转向上下文信号，误导提示引入不稳定性；3）长推理链提示能诱导生成更长推理链，提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought推理的有效性源于模型在预训练先验与上下文学习之间的动态平衡，提示工程可以诱导更深入的推理过程，为理解和改进大语言模型的推理能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Motivation: 情感是人类社会功能中的关键现象，但在文本表现方面仍是一个广泛开放的课题。当前评估方法的情感理论框架未被充分利用，提供了与传统方法互补的不同视角。

Method: 使用基于评估方法手动标注的工业语料库，训练语言模型来分析标注过程，研究标注分歧背后的统计趋势和语言特征驱动因素。

Result: 标注虽然存在显著分歧，但遵循稳定的统计趋势。语言模型能够成功建模标注过程，变异性由底层语言特征驱动。语言模型能够基于评估标准区分情感情境。

Conclusion: 评估方法为情感分析提供了有价值的补充视角，语言模型能够有效捕捉情感标注的统计规律和语言特征，证明该方法在情感识别中的可行性。

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文化对齐评估方法将文化简化为静态事实或价值观，通过选择题或简答题进行测试，忽视了文化的多元性和互动性现实，以及文化假设在看似"中性"评估环境中的渗透。

Method: 提出有意文化评估框架，系统地表征评估中文化相关考虑因素的出现方式、内容和环境，强调研究者立场性对于促进包容性、文化对齐的NLP研究的重要性。

Result: 建立了系统性的文化评估理论框架，识别了当前评估范式的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 需要超越当前基准测试实践，发现未知的重要应用，并通过HCI启发的参与式方法让社区参与评估设计，以促进更具包容性和文化敏感性的NLP研究。

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然通用性强，但在适应新领域时面临挑战，特别是在低资源领域且缺乏标注数据的情况下。传统微调方法计算成本高且耗时，需要更高效的领域适应方案。

Method: 使用6种参数高效微调技术(PEFTs)在Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型上，基于14个科学、医疗、法律和新闻领域的数据集进行文本摘要任务实验，评估领域内和跨领域适配器的效果。

Result: 实验表明，对于低资源领域，使用领域内适配器的推理性能优于少样本学习，甚至优于更大的Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型。在没有领域内适配器时，跨领域适配器和策略性组合适配器能够利用语言相似性获得更好的适应性。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调技术为低资源领域的适应提供了有效解决方案，跨领域语言相似性的利用可以显著提升模型在资源匮乏环境下的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

Conclusion: KoBLEX和ParSeR为法律领域的LLM评测提供了有效工具，能够测试多跳推理和条文基础能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

TL;DR: LLMs通过高质量游戏数据微调可以接近强游戏AI性能，能同时掌握多种复杂卡牌游戏，但会降低通用能力，可通过加入通用指令数据缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在复杂卡牌游戏中的潜力，验证LLMs是否能在复杂游戏中取得类似AlphaGo等AI的成功。

Method: 系统评估LLMs在8种不同卡牌游戏中的学习能力，通过高质量游戏数据进行监督微调，并测试模型在掌握游戏同时保持通用能力的情况。

Result: LLMs通过微调可接近强游戏AI性能；能同时掌握多个复杂卡牌游戏，相似规则游戏性能增强，不相似规则存在冲突；掌握复杂游戏会导致通用能力下降。

Conclusion: LLMs展现出强大的学习能力和多任务适应性，但在专业化过程中需要平衡通用能力的保持，集成通用指令数据是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

*Mohammad Zbeeb,Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种从经过强化学习训练的大语言模型中提取推理能力向量（reasoning vector）的方法，通过简单的张量算术操作就能将推理能力迁移到其他模型上，显著提升多种推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常需要昂贵的优化（如强化学习）来掌握复杂推理任务。本研究旨在证明一旦学习到的推理能力可以被提取和迁移，从而重复利用已有的计算投资。

Method: 从两个相同初始化的Qwen2.5模型中提取推理向量：一个经过监督微调（SFT），另一个经过组相对策略优化（GRPO）。推理向量定义为v_reason = θ_GRPO - θ_SFT，然后通过简单的算术加法将该向量应用到兼容的指令调优模型上。

Result: 推理向量在多个推理基准测试中带来一致性能提升：GSM8K（+4.9%）、HumanEval（+4.3%）、SciQ（+1.7%）和BigBenchHard（1.5B模型+12.3%）。在对抗条件下性能提升仍然保持。相反，减去该向量会导致性能显著下降（GSM8K上-11.8%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过昂贵的训练开发的推理能力可以从现有的开源模型中提取，并通过简单的张量算术重复使用，为通过回收先前的计算投资来增强模型提供了一种实用方法。

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

Motivation: 解决数字空间中的仇恨言论问题，需要结合自动化系统的速度和人类审核员的判断力，同时提供决策解释以建立信任

Method: 构建AI代理系统，使用大语言模型配合专门工具：与真实仇恨言论案例对比、BERT分类器标记有害信息、Urban Dictionary查询俚语、生成思维链推理、检查平台指南

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越现有最先进方法，达到0.91的宏观F1分数

Conclusion: WATCHED工具通过支持AI与人类监督的协作，帮助减少网络危害，适用于审核员、安全团队和研究人员

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

Conclusion: 该框架支持跨应用场景的系统性跨文档理解研究，生成的新数据集为媒体框架分析和同行评审等众多跨文档任务奠定了基础

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

Method: 分析各种NAC模型产生的离散语音token，检验其符合Zipf定律、Heaps定律等语言统计规律的情况，计算熵和和冗余度，并使用语音识别错误率和UTMOS评分评估语义保存和语音质量

Result: NAC token（特别是3-grams）呈现出类似语言的统计模式，这些统计特性与信息内容量指标相关联，且与改善的语音识别和重构性能相关

Conclusion: 神经音频编码器产生的token序列具有语言统计特性，这些发现为设计更有效的生成式语音模型提供了见解

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学应用题上表现出色，但在元推理任务如识别学生解答中的错误步骤方面存在明显困难，需要改进这一能力。

Method: 提出一种方法：生成中间修正的学生解答，使其更接近原始学生解答，从而提高错误定位性能。使用VtG和PRM800K两个错误推理数据集进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，即使提供参考答案，最先进的LLMs也难以准确定位学生解答中的第一个错误步骤。提出的中间修正方法有效提升了错误定位性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成与原始学生解答更接近的中间修正版本，可以显著提升LLMs在定位数学解答中第一个错误步骤的能力，为解决元推理挑战提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word

as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的思维链推理过程不透明，难以在高风险场景中进行验证、调试和控制，需要更可靠和可理解的推理方法

Method: 开发Vis-CoT框架，将线性CoT文本转换为交互式推理图，支持用户可视化逻辑流程、识别错误步骤、修剪错误路径和嫁接新前提

Result: 在GSM8K和StrategyQA数据集上，Vis-CoT比非交互式基线提高最终答案准确率高达24个百分点，用户研究显示可用性和信任度大幅提升

Conclusion: Vis-CoT通过结合LLM和针对性人工监督，为实现更可靠、可理解和协作的推理提供了实用路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个基于世界价值观调查的评估框架，系统评估LLMs在不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况，发现LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐，而与大多数国家对齐不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注美国或少数国家的人口群体意见，缺乏全球国家样本、不同历史时期人类意见研究，以及使用语言引导LLMs的讨论，同时忽视了提示语言对LLMs意见对齐的潜在影响。

Method: 基于世界价值观调查(WVS)创建评估框架，系统评估LLMs在全球不同国家、语言和历史时期与人类意见的对齐情况。

Result: LLMs仅与少数国家适当或过度对齐意见，而与大多数国家对齐不足；改变提示语言以匹配问卷语言能有效引导LLMs与相应国家意见对齐；LLMs更符合当代人口的意见。

Conclusion: 这是首个在全球、语言和时间维度上全面调查LLMs意见对齐主题的研究，提供了评估框架和公开的代码数据。

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: UniCR是一个统一框架，将多种不确定性证据转化为校准的正确概率，并通过原则性拒绝来执行用户指定的错误预算，提高语言模型的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署的语言模型需要决定何时回答、何时不回答，以避免错误回答。现有方法往往缺乏统一的证据融合和风险控制机制。

Method: 使用温度缩放和适当评分学习轻量级校准头，支持黑盒API模型，利用符合风险控制提供分布无关保证，通过检索证据监督原子事实性分数来对齐长文本生成的置信度。

Result: 在短问答、代码生成和检索增强长问答任务中，相比熵或logit阈值、后验校准器和端到端选择性基线，校准指标持续改善，风险-覆盖率曲线下面积降低，固定风险下覆盖率更高。

Conclusion: UniCR提供了一个从证据融合到校准概率再到风险控制决策的可移植方案，无需微调基础模型，在分布偏移下仍有效，通过信息丰富的拒绝消息提高可信度。

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练后知识静态化，现有知识编辑方法要么过度依赖表面线索，要么在噪声多跳条件下性能下降，需要更可靠的知识更新方法

Method: 端到端推理链编辑框架，包含事实确认、相关性判定、选择性应用和最终推理四个结构化阶段，在MQuAKE-CF数据集上训练

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B模型上实现90.2%的多跳问答准确率，在重度干扰下仅下降6.3%，答案泄露时下降<1%，建立了新的SOTA

Conclusion: Reason-KE展示了在噪声多跳条件下的强大韧性和效率，为可靠的LLM知识更新提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型会产生事实性错误的幻觉，研究者主要使用检索增强语言模型和拒绝后训练两种方法，但缺乏对RALMs拒绝能力的系统评估。

Method: 通过分析不同内部和外部知识状态下的校准情况，研究拒绝后训练方法（Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning和In-Context Fine-tuning）对过度拒绝问题的影响，并开发了改进拒绝方法。

Result: 发现LLMs存在显著过度拒绝行为；In-context fine-tuning缓解了过度拒绝问题，而R-tuning加剧了该问题；拒绝能力可能与答案质量存在冲突。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对RALM系统中重要因素影响的更全面理解，开发了简单有效的拒绝方法来提高整体答案质量。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统采用简单的top-k语义搜索机制，经常导致检索到不相关或冗余信息，从而降低性能和处理效率。

Method: 提出五阶段模块化设计：初始检索、相关性验证、备用检索、上下文优先级排序和token预算分配，实现细粒度控制和任务依赖的过滤适配。

Result: 在知识密集型QA任务上，MeVe相比标准RAG实现，在Wikipedia数据集上减少57%的上下文冗余，在更复杂的HotpotQA数据集上减少75%。

Conclusion: MeVe通过主动验证信息和精炼上下文，为LLM应用提供了更可扩展和可靠的框架，实现了更好的基础支撑和更准确的事实支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比不同历史时期社区工会的语境特征，探索社区工会主义在不同时代和组织背景下的差异性和连续性。

Method: 使用BERTopic进行主题建模和cTF-IDF权重计算，结合词频分析，对比分析1920年代的B&S工会和2010-2020年代的Unite Community工会的语境内容。

Result: 现代Unite Community显示出更强的向外寻求、社会公正导向的主题，而B&S工会则重点关注内部管理、工业关系和成员服务，反映了更传统的服务导向模式。

Conclusion: 虽然两个工会都涉及社区相关主题，但其参与模式存在显著差异，这挑战了社区工会主义在不同时期和领域的连续性和普遍性假设。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of

*Kairong Han,Wenshuo Zhao,Ziyu Zhao,JunJian Ye,Lujia Pan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Causal Attention Tuning (CAT)方法，通过向注意力机制注入细粒度因果知识，解决LLMs在OOD场景中依赖伪相关而非真实因果关系的问题。


<details>

Method: 提出CAT方法，包括自动化生成token级因果信号的流程和Re-Attention机制，通过人类先验知识指导训练，使模型关注因果结构并减少注意力分数中的噪声和偏差。

Result: 在提出的Spurious Token Game基准测试和多个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法能有效利用因果知识进行预测，并在OOD场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAT方法成功地将因果知识注入到注意力机制中，显著提升了LLMs在因果推理和OOD泛化方面的性能，为解决模型依赖伪相关问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

*Seungkyu Lee,Nalim Kim,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了In-N-Out数据集，通过将API文档转换为结构化API图来改善工具代理在多工具查询中的性能，显著提升了工具检索和API调用生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度增加，基于LLM的工具代理难以正确识别和调用API，特别是需要组合多个API的复杂任务。现有方法仅依赖API文档，缺乏对API依赖关系的结构化理解。

Method: 将API文档转换为结构化API图来捕捉API依赖关系，创建专家标注的In-N-Out数据集，包含来自两个真实API基准的API图，用于训练模型理解API文档和参数关系。

Result: 使用In-N-Out数据集后，工具检索和多工具查询生成的性能几乎翻倍，比仅使用文档的LLM表现更好。经过微调的模型生成的API图能够弥补90%的性能差距。

Conclusion: 显式API图对工具代理具有重要价值，In-N-Out数据集是理解API文档和参数关系的宝贵资源，显著提升了复杂任务中API调用的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一种基于自评估的校准方法，通过聚合LLM中间层的内部信念来获得更准确的置信度分数，显著改善了模型校准性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常表现出过度自信，生成看似合理但错误的答案，特别是在经过RLHF训练的模型中，这对可靠的不确定性估计和安全部署构成挑战

Method: 提出EAGLE方法，从LLM的多个中间层提取内部信念，聚合这些层间信念并计算置信度分数分布的期望值，从而获得更精细化的置信度分数

Result: 在多样化数据集和LLM上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE显著优于现有基线方法，改善了校准性能

Conclusion: EAGLE通过利用LLM内部隐藏状态进行自评估，能够更准确地反映模型内部确定性，为可靠的不确定性估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，句子嵌入空间中的几何距离并不能预测句子嵌入在不同任务上的性能表现，语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的，而不是反映在嵌入空间的几何结构中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究句子嵌入空间中距离的接近性是否能够扩展到句子嵌入的共享属性，即是否相似的句子嵌入在空间中距离相近，以及这种几何关系是否能预测它们在各种任务上的性能。

Method: 通过三种方式计算句子嵌入：平均词嵌入、特殊[CLS]标记的嵌入和随机词标记的嵌入。研究探索了句子嵌入变体之间的距离与其在语言任务上性能之间的相关性，以及它们是否以相同方式编码相同信息。

Result: 结果显示余弦相似度只能捕捉句子嵌入之间的浅层共性或差异，这些差异不能预测在特定任务上的性能。语言信息是通过不同维度的加权组合编码的，而不是反映在句子嵌入空间的几何结构中。

Conclusion: 句子嵌入空间的几何结构不能预测其相对性能表现，语言信息的编码方式比简单的几何距离关系更加复杂和深层。

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，AI生成文本难以与人类文本区分，而现代诗歌因其独特特征使得AI生成诗歌的检测更加困难，已经影响诗歌生态系统。

Method: 构建高质量数据集，包含6位专业诗人的800首诗和4个主流LLMs生成的41,600首诗；系统性评估6种检测器在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前检测器无法作为可靠工具检测LLMs生成的现代诗歌，最难检测的是诗歌的本质特征（特别是风格）。

Conclusion: 研究验证了所提基准的有效性和必要性，为未来AI生成诗歌的检测奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT是一种结合微调Transformer和图注意力网络的新型自动作文评分方法，通过双流预测和句法依赖关系建模，在分析性评分维度上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工评分耗时且不一致，现有自动评分方法使用静态词嵌入无法捕捉上下文语义，且多采用整体评分而忽略具体写作维度。

Method: 将微调Transformer（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTaV3）与GAT配对，第一流生成文章级预测，第二流在Transformer词嵌入上应用GAT并构建句法依赖边，最后融合两流预测。

Result: 在ELLIPSE数据集上，TransGAT平均二次加权Kappa达到0.854，在所有分析性评分维度上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TransGAT展示了结合Transformer上下文理解能力和GAT关系建模优势的潜力，可推动自动作文评分系统的发展。

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

Motivation: 需要一种高效的方法来计算基于发音的词语相似性，以分析语言的音乎结构，并支持大规模数据集处理。

Method: 使用Needleman-Wunsch算法计算音乎转写的相似性，用Rust实现并在CPU和GPU上并行化（利用CUDA和cudarc库），构建全连通图进行聚类分析。

Result: 方法能够高效处理大规模数据集，GPU实现带来显著性能提升，通过聚类算法成功识别出音乎相似的词语群。

Conclusion: 该方法在语言音乎结构分析中具有可行性和有效性，并可易扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出InSide模型，通过图神经网络联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，实现更有效的假新闻检测，在四个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法主要依赖语义线索（如情感词、文体特征），容易陷入表面模式检测，在动态环境中性能有限。需要从新闻意图角度深入理解欺骗背后的内在思想。

Method: 提出基于图的意图-语义联合建模（InSide）方法：1）将语义和意图信号重构为异构图结构；2）通过实体引导实现长距离上下文交互；3）粗到细的意图建模；4）基于动态路径的图对齐策略建立共同空间

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了InSide相比最先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: 通过联合建模新闻语义和意图信号，能够更深入地理解新闻欺骗的内在机制，显著提升假新闻检测性能

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了chDzDT，一个专门针对阿尔及利亚方言形态特征的字符级预训练语言模型，通过字符级建模解决方言处理中的形态复杂性和代码转换问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔及利亚方言在自然语言处理中代表性不足，其复杂的形态、频繁的代码转换、多文字系统和来自其他语言的强烈词汇影响使得传统词级或子词级方法效果有限。

Method: 开发字符级预训练模型chDzDT，在孤立词上进行训练，不依赖分词边界或标准化拼写。训练语料来自YouTube评论、法语/英语/柏柏尔语维基百科和Tatoeba项目，涵盖多种文字和语言变体。

Result: 构建了多语言阿尔及利亚词典数据集，开发了专注于形态学的编码器，在低资源方言处理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 字符级建模为形态丰富、资源稀缺的方言处理提供了有效解决方案，为构建更具包容性和适应性的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLM的提示词敏感性可能更多是评估方法的人为产物而非模型固有缺陷，使用LLM作为评判者能显著降低性能方差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视广泛报道的提示词敏感性问题，探究这是LLM的固有弱点还是评估过程的人为产物

Method: 系统评估7个LLM模型在6个基准测试上的表现，使用12种不同的提示模板，对比启发式评估方法和LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法

Result: 使用LLM作为评判者时，性能方差显著降低，模型排名在不同提示间相关性更高，现代LLM对提示模板的鲁棒性比之前认为的更强

Conclusion: 提示词敏感性更多是评估方法的问题而非模型缺陷，采用语义理解的评估方法能更准确反映LLM的真实能力

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的大型语言模型的发展，AI面试官系统能够实时进行语音调查。本文旨在评估这类系统在定量和定性研究数据收集中的适用性，了解其优势和局限性。

Method: 通过评估AI面试官和传统交互式语音应答(IVR)系统在两个维度上的表现：输入/输出性能（语音识别、答案记录、情感处理）和语言推理能力（探询、澄清、处理分支逻辑）。

Result: 实地研究表明，AI面试官在定量和定性数据收集方面已经超越IVR系统，但存在实时转录错误率较高、情感检测能力有限、后续提问质量不均等问题。

Conclusion: 当前AI面试官技术的实用性、使用和采用可能取决于具体情境，特别是在定性数据收集工作中，其应用需要根据具体场景进行评估。

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Result: 显著提升了AI在医疗保健中的应用，提供了可扩展的解决方案，提高了从EHR中提取信息的准确性和可用性

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进信息提取和评估方式，帮助临床医生做出更明智的决策，提升患者护理效果

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主诉记录存在多种录入方式和医疗术语变体，难以标准化处理，需要自动化方法来支持医疗文本挖掘和记录标准化

Method: 采用分割匹配算法生成弱标注数据，然后训练基于BERT的模型进行实体识别和本体链接

Result: 在120万条真实主诉记录上实验，方法性能优于现有无人工标注方法

Conclusion: 弱监督方法能有效解决主诉记录的实体提取和标准化问题，无需人工标注成本

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

Motivation: 争议解决在各个领域普遍存在，传统方式依赖人类法官，本文旨在探索LLMs作为法官助手来提高争议解决效率和质量。

Method: 开发DRAssist系统，从非结构化争议描述中提取关键结构元素并生成结构化摘要，使用多种提示策略和多LLMs在三个层次上产生争议解决输出。

Result: 通过合适的评估指标与相关基线比较，评估了LLMs在所有任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的争议解决助手，在识别强势方、评估具体诉求和论证强度等任务上展现出潜力。

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

*Chao Xue,Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StructCoh是一个图增强的对比学习框架，通过结合结构推理和表示空间优化来解决文本语义匹配问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然擅长捕捉token级交互，但往往忽略层次结构模式，在细微语义区分方面存在困难，需要同时理解结构关系和细粒度语义区别

Method: 采用双图编码器通过依存解析和主题建模构建语义图，使用图同构网络传播结构特征；设计分层对比目标，在多个粒度上实施一致性约束，包括节点级对比正则化和图感知对比学习

Result: 在三个法律文档匹配基准和学术抄袭检测数据集上表现显著优于最先进方法，在法律法规匹配任务上达到86.7%的F1分数（绝对提升6.2%）

Conclusion: StructCoh通过结构推理和表示空间优化的协同结合，有效解决了文本语义匹配中的结构模式捕捉和细微语义区分问题，在多个应用场景中展现出优异性能

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

*Hexian Zhang,Xinyu Yan,Yanqi Yang,Lijian Jin,Ping Yang,Junwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSeek V3在牙科纵向病例分析中表现最佳，在忠实度和专家评分方面超越GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash和Copilot，显示出在医疗教育和研究中的潜在应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在医疗领域特别是牙科纵向患者叙事分析中的能力，现有商业模型在此方面的表现尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 使用34个标准化牙周病例（共258个问答对），通过开放式临床任务评估4个先进LLM（GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash、Copilot和DeepSeek V3），采用自动化指标和执业牙医盲法评估。

Result: DeepSeek表现最优，忠实度中位数0.528（其他模型0.367-0.457），专家评分中位数4.5/5（其他4.0/5），且未显著影响可读性。

Conclusion: DeepSeek是病例分析领域的领先LLM，适合作为医疗教育和研究的辅助工具，并具有成为领域特定代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt是一个结合遗传算法和LLM的新框架，通过将语义文本属性视为基因序列，利用LLM模拟交叉和变异操作来增强合成数据生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型擅长生成合成数据，但确保其质量和多样性仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够产生更接近真实世界数据分布的高质量合成数据的方法。

Method: 提出Genetic Prompt框架，将语义文本属性作为基因序列，利用LLM模拟遗传算法中的交叉和变异操作。集成主动学习方案来优化父代选择，扩展后代搜索空间。

Result: 在多个NLP任务上的实验表明：Genetic Prompt显著优于最先进的基线方法，在不同生成模型大小和规模上都表现出稳健性能。将合成数据与原始训练集融合能显著提升下游模型性能，特别是在类别不平衡场景中。

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt是生成高质量合成数据的有效方法，适用于广泛的NLP应用，能够产生更接近真实数据分布的合成数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

TL;DR: 指令微调显著提升大语言模型在英语和意大利语中的长度控制能力，主要通过深层网络组件的专业化实现，不同语言采用不同的补偿机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在精确字数控制文本生成方面的挑战，比较基础模型和指令微调模型在英语和意大利语中的表现差异。

Method: 使用累积加权归因（源自直接对数归因）分析模型性能和内部组件贡献，重点关注不同层级的注意力头和MLP组件。

Result: 指令微调大幅改善长度控制，英语中深层注意力头贡献显著增加，意大利语中最终层MLP发挥更强补偿作用。

Conclusion: 指令微调重新配置深层网络以实现任务遵循，组件级策略可能根据语言上下文进行适应性调整。

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

TL;DR: CRPO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过检索对比优质和劣质提示样本，利用LLM的推理能力进行分层和多维度的对比分析，显著提升了提示优化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注直接提示精炼或模型微调，忽视了利用LLM固有推理能力从对比示例中学习的潜力。

Method: 提出对比推理提示优化(CRPO)框架：1)从HelpSteer2数据集中检索参考提示；2)分层对比推理：比较高、中、低质量提示进行反思推理；3)多维度对比推理：分析各评估维度的最佳提示并整合优势。

Result: 在HelpSteer2基准测试中，CRPO显著优于基线方法，证明了对比性检索增强推理在自动提示优化中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过显式对比优质和劣质示例，CRPO使模型能够推断提示成功或失败的原因，实现了更鲁棒和可解释的优化，为自动提示优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型评估基于预定义问题集的范式存在交互有限、难度控制不足和评估结果有效性验证困难等问题，难以精确确定目标模型的知识和能力边界。

Method: 采用知识驱动的数据合成和目标自适应难度调整方法，通过基准评分、交互扩展和评估反馈的综合评估方法进行扩展测试。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了JudgeAgent及其动态评估范式的有效性，提供了准确有效的评估结果。

Conclusion: JudgeAgent框架解决了传统评估范式的局限性，为LLM能力评估提供了更精确和有效的方法，并通过新的验证视角证实了其有效性。

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG)方法，通过同时利用文本和图像信息进行多模态文档问答，显著优于纯视觉方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理多模态文档时存在局限：基于布局分析的方法只能利用显式文本信息，无法处理图像；基于视觉语言模型的方法忽略了文本的语义优势

Method: 首先对文档进行结构化解析获得文本片段和图像区域的共模态表示，然后分别从文本和图像通道检索候选证据，在跨模态检索层面聚合结果，最后提示VLM基于共模态检索结果生成最终响应

Result: 实验表明该方法在视觉文档问答任务中显著优于纯视觉RAG方法

Conclusion: 将共模态信息统一整合到RAG框架中是提升复杂文档视觉问答系统性能的有效方法

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

TL;DR: AMBEDKAR框架通过宪法感知解码层，在不修改基础模型参数的情况下，在推理时减少LLM中的种姓和宗教偏见，实现了高达26.41%的偏见减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能反映训练数据中的社会偏见，特别是在印度语境下的种姓和宗教偏见。现有缓解策略多为西方中心，无法处理这些本地细微差别。

Method: 提出宪法感知解码层，基于印度AI宪法指导，在推理时应用。采用推测解码算法，让小型语言模型作为潜在偏见生成器，大型语言模型作为宪法指导的验证器来强制执行无偏见轨迹。

Result: 相比基线，该方法实现了高达26.41%的绝对偏见减少，且无需重新训练模型，降低了计算和基础设施成本。

Conclusion: AMBEDKAR框架成功地将推测解码重新诠释为公平性机制而非效率工具，为处理本地化社会偏见提供了有效的解决方案，同时保持了模型性能并降低了实施成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

Motivation: 解决低资源语言NER任务中大型多语言模型内存占用大、延迟高的问题，探索小规模解码器模型通过元学习实现快速适应和零样本跨语言迁移的可能性。

Method: 使用一阶模型无关元学习（MAML）替换部分自回归目标进行预训练，在塔加洛语和宿务语这两种类型相似但结构不同的语言上进行测试，涵盖4种模型规模（11M-570M）。

Result: MAML方法在仅头部调优时提升零样本micro-F1分数2-6个百分点，全模型调优时提升1-3个百分点，同时减少收敛时间达8%。对与塔加洛语格助词si/ni共现的单标记人名实体效果最显著。

Conclusion: 元学习预训练能够有效提升小规模模型在低资源语言NER任务中的零样本迁移性能，表面锚点（如格助词）在跨语言实体识别中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在相同输入提示下往往生成重复单调的输出，特别是在故事生成任务中缺乏创意多样性

Method: Avoidance Decoding解码策略，通过自适应平衡两种相似性惩罚：早期优先概念级相似性惩罚以多样化初始故事概念，后期逐渐强调叙事级相似性惩罚以确保自然且多样化的情节发展

Result: 相比强基线方法，输出多样性提高2.6倍，重复性平均减少30%，同时有效缓解文本退化问题，激活了更广泛的神经元

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了LLM生成内容的多样性，证明了其能够有效利用模型的内在创造力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型的幻觉、偏见、隐私和高计算成本问题，这些问题主要源于单一模型同时处理语言能力和事实记忆的设计缺陷。

Method: 评估135M到32B参数规模的模型在三个维度上的表现：语言能力、外部事实知识和内部事实知识，分析规模扩展对不同能力的影响。

Result: 发现语言能力和事实知识都随规模增长而提升，但内部事实知识增长更快，表明模型规模与记忆能力的关系比与核心语言能力的关系更密切。

Conclusion: 支持模块化语言建模方法，使用紧凑的语言能力强模型作为工具增强系统的基础，提供更高效、可解释和可持续的NLP解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在团队对话分析中的应用，不仅能推断人类思维，还能曝露团队成员间的理解差异和盲点

Method: 两步框架：第一步用LLM为任务导向对话生成共享心智模型注释，第二步用另一个LLM比较模型注释与人工注释的差异，并与标准标签进行对比

Result: 虽然LLM在简单自然语言注释任务中表现出明显的一致性，但在需要空间推理或语调辨别的场景中系统性地出错

Conclusion: 研究提供了一套可重复的共享心智模型一致性评估框架，并实证了LLM在团队对话分析中的优势和限制

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios

TL;DR: DCPO通过动态裁剪策略和平滑优势标准化技术，解决了RLVR中梯度消失问题，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO存在梯度消失问题，主要原因是固定的token级概率比裁剪边界和相同奖励的标准化，导致梯度更新无效和生成响应利用不足。

Method: 提出了动态裁剪策略优化(DCPO)，包括基于token特定先验概率自适应调整裁剪边界的动态裁剪策略，以及跨累积训练步骤标准化奖励的平滑优势标准化技术。

Result: 在四个基准测试中实现SOTA性能，AIME24上Avg@1达46.7，Avg@32达38.8；AIME25上达23.3/19.0。非零优势比GRPO平均提升28%，训练效率比DAPO翻倍，token裁剪率显著降低一个数量级。

Conclusion: DCPO能更有效地利用生成数据进行大语言模型的强化学习，在性能和效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

TL;DR: 本综述论文系统梳理了大语言模型中的隐式推理方法，提出了基于执行范式的分类法，将现有方法分为潜在优化、信号引导控制和层循环执行三大类，并提供了评估指标和基准的综述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在各种任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，但现有研究主要关注显式推理（如思维链提示），而对隐式推理（通过潜在结构进行内部计算）缺乏机制层面的系统分析。

Method: 提出以执行范式为中心的分类法，将隐式推理方法分为三类：潜在优化（通过梯度优化潜在表示）、信号引导控制（使用外部信号指导内部计算）、层循环执行（在模型层间循环执行推理）。同时综述了支持隐式推理存在的结构、行为和表示证据。

Result: 建立了隐式推理的系统分类框架，整理了现有评估指标和基准，为理解LLM内部推理机制提供了结构化视角。

Conclusion: 隐式推理是LLM推理的重要方向，具有生成成本低、推理速度快、与内部计算更好对齐等优势。该综述填补了机制层面分析的空白，为未来研究提供了理论基础和分类框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Motivation: 现有方法在时间序列意见分析方面存在空白，缺乏时态基础的细粒度注释，限制了预测和趋势分析等下游应用的发展

Method: 整合成熟的意见挖掘形式化方法到声明式LLM注释流水线中，定义三种基于情感和意见挖掘文献的数据模型，使用两个独立LLM进行最终注释

Result: 通过人工注释测试样本进行严格的定量评估，计算了细粒度意见维度上的注释者一致性，构建了时间对齐的结构化意见知识库

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时态意见注释的缺口，构建的知识库兼容于RAG、时态问答和时间线摘要等应用

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交远程医疗平台上存在大量的阿拉伯语医疗文本数据，需要有效的方法来分类疾病症状，以支持医疗诊断和建议。

Method: 采用三种阿拉伯语医疗文本预处理方法（摘要、精炼、命名实体识别），然后对精调的阿拉伯语transformer模型（CAMeLBERT、AraBERT、AsafayaBERT）进行疾病分类，最后采用多数投票集成方法结合原始和预处理文本的预测结果。

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLM基于预处理与精调阿拉伯语transformer模型和集成学习结合的研究，为阿拉伯语医疗文本分析提供了有效的疾病分类方案。

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

TL;DR: EmoPerso是一个自监督框架，通过情感感知建模改进人格检测，利用生成机制进行数据增强和表示学习，通过多任务学习和交叉注意力模块捕捉人格特质与情感特征的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人格检测方法严重依赖大规模标注数据集，难以获得高质量的人格标签，且大多将情感和人格视为独立变量，忽略了它们的相互作用。

Method: 提出EmoPerso框架：1）利用生成机制进行合成数据增强和丰富表示学习；2）提取伪标签情感特征并通过多任务学习与人格预测联合优化；3）使用交叉注意力模块捕捉人格特质与情感表征的细粒度交互；4）采用自学习策略迭代增强模型推理能力。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，EmoPerso超越了最先进的模型。

Conclusion: EmoPerso通过情感感知建模和自监督学习有效提升了人格检测性能，证明了情感与人格之间相互作用的重要性。

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

TL;DR: 研究表明LLM在任务处理中并不总是整合外部标签定义，而是经常依赖内部参数化知识，特别是在通用任务中；领域特定任务更能从显式定义中受益


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM是真正整合外部定义还是主要依赖其参数化知识，以及外部标签定义对模型性能的影响

Method: 在多个解释基准数据集（通用和领域特定）上进行控制实验，使用专家策划、LLM生成、扰动和交换的定义等不同标签定义条件

Result: 显式标签定义可以提高准确性和可解释性，但LLM并不保证或一致地将其整合到任务解决过程中，模型经常默认使用内部表示，特别是在通用任务中

Conclusion: 需要更深入理解LLM如何处理外部知识与其预训练能力的关系，外部定义整合存在不一致性，领域特定任务更能从显式定义中受益

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型发布商虽然公布了详细的行为指南，但并不清楚模型是否真正遵守这些规范，需要系统性的审计方法

Method: 通过解析行为声明、生成针对性提示、使用模型作为判断者来验证三方一致性（提供商规范-模型输出-模型判断）

Result: 对16个模型进行超过100个行为声明的审计，发现系统性不一致性，最高达20%的遵循性缺口

Conclusion: 基础模型在遵循发布商指南方面存在显著问题，三方一致性框架为建立必要的基准线提供了方法

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型严重依赖大规模标注偏好数据，而预训练方法未能有效注入显式推理能力，需要开发能够进行奖励推理的通用奖励模型

Method: 采用自训练方法利用未标注数据激发奖励推理，开发GRAM-R²生成式奖励模型，能够同时输出偏好标签和奖励理由

Result: 在响应排序、任务适应和人类反馈强化学习等实验中，GRAM-R² consistently outperforms several strong discriminative and generative baselines

Conclusion: GRAM-R²作为奖励推理的基础模型，能够支持下游应用如响应排序和任务特定奖励调优，在广泛任务中表现优异且需要极少或无需额外微调

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

Method: 构建风格专家混合(MoSEs)框架，包含风格参考库(SRR)、风格路由器(SAR)和条件阈值估计器(CTE)三个核心组件，通过动态阈值估计实现风格感知的不确定性量化

Result: 平均检测性能提升11.34%，在少量数据情况下更达39.15%的显著改善

Conclusion: MoSEs框架通过风格建模和动态阈值估计，有效提升了AI生成文本检测的性能和可靠性，特别在少量数据场景下体现出明显优势

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言语义评估的挑战，特别是在印度语言中缺乏高质量基准测试的问题。

Method: 构建包含20,000篇新闻文章的数据集，每篇文章配有四个标题变体（原始、语义相似、词汇相似、不相关），使用余弦相似度评估多种句子变换器模型。

Conclusion: 该数据集为印度语言NLP提供了有价值的基准资源，可用于RAG管道评估、多选题问答等多种应用场景。

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发现和验证Federico Pucci在1931年提出的机械翻译系统，这一系统在历史上几乎被完全遗忘，但可能是机器翻译领域的早期重要贡献。

Method: 使用AI按照Pucci的方法重新翻译1931年文献中的两个文本片段（但丁《新生》意大利语-法语和伏尔泰《查第格》法语-意大利语），然后扩展到英语、西班牙语和德语的翻译。

Result: AI按照Pucci方法翻译的结果与94年前的原始翻译差异很小，验证了该系统的有效性。进一步成功翻译了更现代和技术性的文本。

Conclusion: Pucci的系统经过验证有效，应被重新认定为机器翻译领域的先驱之一，与Troyanskij、Booth和Weaver等人并列，这可能会改写机器翻译的历史认知。

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

Motivation: 现有截断采样技术（如温度缩放、top-p采样、min-p采样）在平衡文本生成多样性和逻辑连贯性方面存在局限，特别是未能有效利用模型置信度信息

Method: 首先建立熵约束最小散度问题的理论框架，证明其等价于NP难的熵约束质量最大化问题，然后提出计算高效的top-H贪婪算法来解决该问题

Result: 在创意写作基准上比min-p采样性能提升25.63%，在GPQA、GSM8K和MT-Bench等问答数据集上保持鲁棒性，LLM作为评判者的评估确认了即使在高温下也能产生连贯输出

Conclusion: top-H解码在开放文本生成方面达到了最先进水平，易于集成到创意写作应用中，有效解决了创造性与连贯性的平衡问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 代码混合文本(特别是Hinglish)的命名实体识别面临非正式结构、音译和频繁语言转换等独特挑战，需要评估不同模型在此任务上的表现

Result: 代码混合模型(特别是HingRoBERTa和HingBERT)表现最佳，超越了包括Google Gemini在内的闭源LLMs；非代码混合模型表现尚可但适应性有限；Google Gemini在零样本设置下展现出有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: 专门针对代码混合数据预训练的模型在Hinglish NER任务中表现最优，但现代LLMs也显示出强大的泛化能力，为专业模型与通用模型的比较提供了重要见解

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot

### [217] [Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522)
*Jiaming Li,Longze Chen,Ze Gong,Yukun Chen,Lu Wang,Wanwei He,Run Luo,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PACS是一个新颖的RLVR框架，通过监督学习实现隐式Actor-Critic耦合，将可验证奖励转化为可预测标签，用交叉熵损失优化，在数学推理任务上显著优于PPO和GRPO等基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在奖励信号稀疏和策略梯度更新不稳定的问题，特别是在基于RL的方法中，需要更稳定高效的训练框架。

Method: 将RLVR问题重新表述为监督学习任务，将结果奖励视为可预测标签，通过交叉熵损失优化策略模型参数化的评分函数，实现隐式的Actor-Critic耦合。

Result: 在AIME 2025数学推理任务上，PACS在pass@256指标达到59.78%，比PPO和GRPO分别提升13.32和14.36个百分点。

Conclusion: PACS提供了一个简单而强大的框架，为具有可验证奖励的LLM后训练提供了有前景的途径，实现了更稳定高效的训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

TL;DR: 提出了Flavors of Moonshine系列小型ASR模型，专门针对代表性不足的语言。研究发现对于小模型（27M参数），单语训练在精心平衡的高质量数据上表现优于多语模型，错误率比同等大小的Whisper Tiny低48%，甚至超越大9倍的Whisper Small模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前普遍认为多语ASR模型通过利用跨语言语音相似性优于单语模型的假设，特别针对小参数模型和代表性不足语言进行研究。

Method: 使用精心平衡的高质量人类标注、伪标注和合成数据训练单语系统，模型规模为27M参数。

Result: 平均错误率比同等大小的Whisper Tiny低48%，性能超越大9倍的Whisper Small模型，在大多数情况下匹配或超越大28倍的Whisper Medium模型。

Conclusion: 这些结果推动了该规模模型的技术水平，为之前支持有限的语言实现了准确的设备端ASR，并开源发布了阿拉伯语、中文、日语、韩语、乌克兰语和越南语模型。

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

*Tianjian Li,Yiming Zhang,Ping Yu,Swarnadeep Saha,Daniel Khashabi,Jason Weston,Jack Lanchantin,Tianlu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARLING框架通过强化学习同时优化回答质量和语义多样性，解决大语言模型后训练中多样性不足的问题，在创意任务和数学竞赛任务中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的后训练往往过分追求准确性和有用性，导致输出分布过于集中，多样性降低，限制了模型在创意探索类任务（如头脑风暴、故事创作、问题解决）中的实用性。

Method: 提出多样性感知强化学习（DARLING）框架，通过学习的分区函数测量语义多样性（超越表面词汇变化），将多样性信号与质量奖励结合进行在线强化学习。

Result: 在多个模型家族和规模上的实验显示：在非可验证任务（指令跟随和创意写作）中，DARLING始终优于仅优化质量的RL基线，产生更高质量和更新颖的输出；在可验证任务（竞赛数学）中，实现了更高的pass@1（解决方案质量）和pass@k（解决方案多样性）。

Conclusion: 明确优化多样性能够催化在线强化学习中的探索，表现为更高质量的回答，证明质量与多样性可以协同优化而非相互冲突。

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025是首个针对LLMs在阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化领域文化能力的基准测试，包含两个多选题子任务，结果显示任务特定微调显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于西方高资源语言数据训练，对阿拉伯和伊斯兰文化的理解存在明显差距，需要专门评估和改进其文化能力

Method: 设计包含两个子任务（阿拉伯文化和伊斯兰文化）的共享任务，使用现代标准阿拉伯语的多选题，涵盖22个阿拉伯国家的广泛主题

Result: 26个团队注册子任务1，19个注册子任务2，最终分别有9个和6个有效提交。最佳系统在文化问题上达到72.15%准确率，伊斯兰知识达到84.22%

Conclusion: 任务特定微调显著提升性能，参数高效微调是最有效方法，数据增强的效果具有领域依赖性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Conclusion: AMMKD框架有效解决了移动设备部署的轻量化需求，具有高效性和灵活性

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

Abstract: This work focuses on the high carbon emissions generated by deep learning
model training, specifically addressing the core challenge of balancing
algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Motivation: 传统输入模态（如Apex Frame、光流、动态图像）难以充分捕捉微表情的细微短暂特征，导致识别性能不佳，需要开发更有效的输入表示方法和网络架构。

Method: 1. 提出MESTI将视频序列转换为单张图像，保留微运动特征；2. 设计MEGANet网络，引入梯度注意力块来增强细粒度运动特征提取；3. 在多种CNN架构上进行对比实验。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

Motivation: 肾脏异常检测是临床前药物开发的关键环节，但传统方法需要人工检查数百到数千张全切片图像，耗时耗力且成本高昂。大多数切片是正常的，需要检测出指示毒性效应的细微变化。

Conclusion: 通过进一步开发，此类模型可用于在药物安全性评估研究中排除正常切片，从而降低药物开发相关成本和时间。

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Conclusion: 通过生成视觉查询来弥合模态差距的方法有效，结合了视觉编码器、VLM和文本到图像生成模型的最新进展，为文本到图像检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

### [231] [Safe-LLaVA: A Privacy-Preserving Vision-Language Dataset and Benchmark for Biometric Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00192)
*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM基准和Safe-LLaVA数据集，用于评估和减少多模态大语言模型中的生物特征信息泄露问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉语言任务时经常推断和泄露敏感的生物特征信息（如种族、性别、年龄等），即使这些信息没有被明确请求，这在现实应用和社会敏感领域存在严重隐私问题

Method: 1) 创建PRISM基准来评估模型在两个方面：拒绝生物特征相关查询和在保持语义忠实度的同时避免隐含生物特征泄露；2) 对LLaVA数据集进行详细审计，发现广泛的生物特征泄露；3) 构建Safe-LLaVA数据集，通过系统性地移除显性和隐性生物特征信息

Result: 评估显示不同MLLM模型在各种生物特征属性上都存在泄露问题，展示了详细的隐私违规情况。在Safe-LLaVA数据集上微调的模型显著减少了生物特征泄露

Conclusion: Safe-LLaVA和PRISM为隐私对齐的MLLM开发和评估设立了新标准，提供了首个隐私保护的多模态训练数据集和综合评估基准

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,
and the source code is available at

TL;DR: VEME是一个新颖的跨模态对齐方法，通过构建自我中心的世界模型来增强视觉语言模型在动态环境中的时空推理和泛化能力，在未知场景中实现了1%-3%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在静态场景理解方面表现出色，但在动态开放环境中的时空推理和适应能力有限，特别是在任务导向导航和具身问答等任务中，缺乏对细粒度时空线索和物理世界理解的建模。

Method: 提出VEME框架，包含三个核心组件：跨模态对齐框架（连接物体、空间表示和视觉语义）、动态隐式认知地图（通过世界嵌入激活任务相关记忆）、基于指令的导航推理框架（利用具身先验进行长期规划）。

Result: 在VSI-Bench和VLN-CE基准测试中，相比传统方法实现了1%-3%的准确率和探索效率提升，显著改善了动态环境中的推理和规划能力。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入几何感知的时空经验，VEME方法有效增强了视觉语言模型在动态未知环境中的泛化能力和推理性能，为具身智能的发展提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叶独肿瘤在预手术分类中容易与良性纤维膏肿混淆，导致不必要的手术切除，需要更准确的非侵入性诊断方法。

Method: 开发双支神经网络，整合乳腺超声图像和患者元数据特征，采用类意识采样和主体层反复交叉验证来避免类不平衡和数据泄漏。

Result: 多模态方法在分类良性与边界性/恶性叶独肿瘤方面超过单模态基线，ConvNeXt和ResNet18编码器表现最佳，AUC-ROC分别达到0.9427和0.9349，F1分数为0.6720和0.7294。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多模态AI作为非侵入性诊断工具的潜力，可以减少不必要的活检和改善乳腺肿瘤管理中的临床决策。

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe into the properties of dark

performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural
networks and provides insights into the detectability of strong gravitational
lenses on that common test sample. We fine-tune ten architectures using
datasets from HOLISMOKES VI and SuGOHI X, and benchmark them against
convolutional baselines, discussing complexity and inference-time analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FHT2SP算法，一种快速且高精度的霍夫变换算法，在保持常数有界误差的同时实现近最优计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有快速霍夫变换算法(FHT)在计算效率和精度之间存在权衡：FHT2DT等算法具有最优线性复杂度但精度随尺度降低，而高精度算法计算成本接近立方复杂度。

Method: 基于Brady的超像素概念，将其扩展到任意形状（超越原始幂次方约束），并将其集成到FHT2DT算法中，通过超像素尺寸的适当选择实现性能优化。

Result: 对于w×h图像，FHT2SP算法达到近最优计算复杂度O(wh ln³ w)，同时保持与图像尺寸无关的常数有界近似误差，可通过元参数控制。

Conclusion: FHT2SP算法成功解决了霍夫变换中计算效率与精度之间的权衡问题，提供了理论分析和实验验证的高性能解决方案。

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Motivation: 工业计算机视觉系统面临噪声、材料变异性和非控制拍照条件的挑战，传统边缘检测器和手工管道效果有限。

Method: 系统分为三步：数据获取和预处理、使用条件GAN生成轮廓、通过视觉-语言模型进行多模态轮廓精炼，采用标准化提示词和人在循环过程。

Result: 在FabTrack数据集上，系统提升了轮廓保真度，改善了边缘连续性和几何对齐，减少了手工追踪。GPT-image-1在结构准确性和感知质量方面都超过了Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型导向的生成式工作流有力推动工业计算机视觉系统超越传统管道的限制。

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and
perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided
generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the
limitations of classical pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出LIMO方法，通过信息最大化损失和参数高效微调策略，显著提升了transductive few-shot CLIP模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前transductive few-shot learning在视觉-语言基础模型中的研究较少，需要专门针对VLMs的transductive方法

Method: 提出LIMO损失函数，包含三个互补项：视觉输入与文本类别描述的互信息、KL散度惩罚项、标准交叉熵损失；并探索参数高效微调策略

Result: LIMO大幅超越近期transductive few-shot CLIP方法，相比最佳inductive方法也有显著提升

Conclusion: 信息理论概念和参数高效微调在transductive few-shot设置中具有巨大潜力，LIMO为VLM量身定制的方法表现出色

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Result: 注意力图分析显示MorphGen主要依赖核形态、细胞组成和空间细胞组织进行分类。该方法展示了对图像损坏和对抗攻击的强健性，不仅实现了OOD泛化，还解决了数字病理学中深度学习系统的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: MorphGen通过显式建模生物学相关的形态学特征，成功实现了在计算组织病理学中的领域泛化，为数字病理学提供了更可靠的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

Method: 仅对视觉刷进行剪枝，采用互信息基于的策略移除与文本刷语义不对齐的视觉刷，并通过最大化嵌入空间中预期成对距离来保持保留刷的信息多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-NEXT-7B模型上实现了88.9%的刷削减率，推理速度提升56.7%，同时保持了强劲的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过专注于视觉刷剪枝和采用互信息等有效重要性评估方法，可以在保持多模态对齐的前提下显著提升大型多模态模型的效率

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and
personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,
particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This
paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition
system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of
facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature
extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We
introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support
higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the
multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of
these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face
recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and
increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural
networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

TL;DR: 提出ILRNet迭代低秩网络，结合模型驱动和数据驱动方法，通过小波域奇异值阈值处理和迭代优化，实现高光谱图像去噪的先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像去噪是重要预处理步骤，但传统方法难以充分利用HSI的低秩稀疏物理先验，同时在去噪过程中保持图像细节

Method: 在U-Net架构中嵌入秩最小化模块(RMM)，将特征图转换到小波域并对低频分量应用奇异值阈值处理，自适应学习阈值参数，采用迭代细化过程结合中间去噪结果和噪声输入

Result: 在合成和真实噪声去除任务中均达到最先进性能

Conclusion: ILRNet成功整合了模型驱动和数据驱动的优势，能够有效利用HSI的谱低秩特性，实现渐进式增强和优异的图像细节保持

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: SurgLLM框架通过增强空间关注和时间意识，有效解决了手术视频理解中的关键挑战，为多功能计算机辅助手术系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness
of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding. The source code is

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法偏靠错误假设，认为缺失和错误幻觉有共同根源，导致减少缺失却增加错误。这项研究要承认这一偏见并提出更有效的解决方案。

Method: 通过视觉注意力干预实验，提出视觉-语义注意潜力场概念框架，并基于此设计了插件式的视觉潜力场检测方法（VPFC）。

Result: VPFC方法能够有效减少缺失幻觉，同时不会引入额外的错误幻觉，实现了更平衡的幻觉减少效果。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了当前对象幻觉研究的重大忽视，为开发更稳健和平衡的幻觉减少策略指明了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: SPO-VLM是一个两阶段的VLM防御框架，通过激活干预和策略优化增强模型鲁棒性，在保持视觉理解能力的同时有效防御对抗攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于激活引导的防御方法依赖任务特定的对比提示来提取有害方向，性能欠佳且会降低视觉接地性能，需要更有效的防御方案

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段从多样化数据源计算自适应层特定引导向量，第二阶段通过序列级偏好优化（整合毒性评估和视觉一致性奖励）精炼这些向量

Result: 实验表明SPO-VLM通过激活引导和偏好优化增强了安全性，同时在良性任务上保持强性能且不损害视觉理解能力

Conclusion: SPO-VLM通过结合轻量级缓解基础和深度策略精炼，在效率和效果之间取得了平衡，为VLM安全防御提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于点云数据稀缺，预训练大型3D模型面临挑战。现有方法通过"高到低"映射将视觉模型应用于3D领域，但导致空间几何信息丢失且缺乏通用性框架。

Method: 提出APPT方法：1)将原始点云转换为点嵌入表示，聚合局部几何特征获取空间信息；2)使用排列不变性特征捕捉点嵌入的相对位置；3)通过与点嵌入模块共享权重的提示生成器，动态生成点提示来调整自注意力机制。

Result: 方法能够在不添加额外参数的情况下，通过微调少量参数来适配任何模态的预训练模型用于3D点云分析，提供丰富的全局结构信息并补偿异构数据中缺乏结构上下文的问题。

Conclusion: APPT方法为多模态基础模型在3D点云领域的适配提供了一种通用的、参数效率高的解决方案，避免了异构映射导致的空间几何信息丢失问题。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

Motivation: 传统CutMix等方法在组合多类别图像时会产生不自然的边界，需要一种能够生成自然融合特征的高分辨率图像的数据增强方法

Method: 在扩散模型中部分组合两个不同类别对应的估计噪声，利用扩散模型生成自然高分辨率图像的能力和CutMix融合多类别特征的特点

Result: 在分类实验中验证了该方法的有效性，相比传统多类别组合数据增强技术和随机图像生成方法表现更好

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix方法成功实现了自然、高分辨率的双类别特征融合图像生成，为数据增强提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

TL;DR: HERO-VQL是一种针对第一人称视角视频的视觉查询定位新方法，通过自上而下的注意力引导和增强一致性训练，有效解决了视角剧烈变化带来的物体外观变化和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 第一人称视角视频中频繁且剧烈的视角变化导致物体外观显著变化和部分遮挡，使得现有方法难以实现准确定位。

Method: 提出HERO-VQL方法，包含：1）自上而下的注意力引导（TAG），利用类别token提供高层上下文和主成分得分图进行细粒度定位；2）自我中心增强一致性训练（EgoACT），通过替换查询对象和重排视频帧来增强查询多样性并模拟极端视角变化，同时使用一致性损失确保不同增强场景下的稳定定位。

Result: 在VQ2D数据集上的大量实验验证了HERO-VQL能有效处理第一人称视角的挑战，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HERO-VQL通过模拟人类认知过程的对象识别机制，成功解决了第一人称视角视频中的视觉查询定位难题，为处理视角剧烈变化场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

TL;DR: 提出双约束扩散模型(DCDM)用于超低剂量PET重建，通过冻结预训练扩散模型权重并注入可训练的双约束控制器，大幅减少可训练参数数量，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量PET重建在减少患者辐射暴露和缩短检查时间方面具有重要潜力，但会导致噪声增加和成像细节减少，降低图像质量。需要一种既能保持重建质量又具有灵活性的方法。

Method: DCDM模型包含两个约束模块：核变换器约束(NTC)利用核范数作为矩阵秩最小化的近似，将低秩特性集成到Transformer架构中；编码连接约束(ENC)利用压缩特征表示来编码和控制预训练扩散模型。NTC从低剂量图像中提取信息并转换为潜在空间的压缩特征表示，ENC使用这些表示最终在像素空间获得重建PET图像。

Result: 在UDPET公共数据集和临床数据集上的实验表明，DCDM在已知剂量减少因子(DRF)上优于最先进方法，并且在未知DRF场景中具有良好的泛化能力，即使在超低剂量水平(如全剂量的1%)也证明有价值。

Conclusion: DCDM通过双约束控制器有效减少了可训练参数数量，提高了重建灵活性，能够适应不同剂量水平而无需重新训练所有模型参数，在超低剂量PET重建中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

*Ryosuke Seshimo,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对全景视频修复的深度学习模型DAOVI，通过考虑测地距离的时间运动评估模块和深度感知特征传播模块，有效处理等距柱状投影的几何畸变问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景视频在VR和遥感等领域应用广泛，但其广角视野常包含不需要的物体。现有视频修复方法主要针对普通窄视野视频，无法处理全景视频的投影畸变问题。

Method: 提出DAOVI模型，包含两个核心模块：1）基于测地距离评估时间运动信息的图像空间模块；2）针对几何畸变的深度感知特征传播模块。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAOVI模型成功解决了全景视频修复中的几何畸变问题，为全景视频处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细粒度动态细节和生成新视角的合理细节方面存在困难，主要源于化身模型表示能力有限和观测数据不足

Method: 利用Human4DiT视频生成模型生成替代视角的人体运动作为额外监督信号；通过视频微调注入物理身份确保运动一致性；采用基于补丁的去噪算法获得高分辨率细节

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法，验证了所提策略的有效性

Conclusion: 通过利用视频生成模型提供多视角监督，能够丰富未见过区域的细节并正则化化身表示，有效缓解伪影问题

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

TL;DR: LightVLM是一种无需训练即可加速现有视觉语言模型推理的方法，通过分层token合并和KV缓存压缩技术，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在推理过程中存在效率低下的问题，特别是在处理长序列时延迟较高，需要一种无需重新训练就能加速推理的解决方案。

Method: 将VLM推理分为编码和解码两个阶段：编码阶段使用金字塔token合并技术分层减少token数量；解码阶段通过KV缓存压缩移除不必要的缓存来提升网络吞吐量。

Result: 实验显示LightVLM在仅保留35%图像token时保持100%性能，仅保留3% token时仍维持98%性能，网络吞吐量提升2.02倍，预填充时间减少3.65倍，长序列生成时推理时间减少3.21倍。

Conclusion: LightVLM成功实现了在无需重新训练的情况下显著加速VLM推理，使大型模型推理速度超过小型模型，有望促进视觉语言模型的实际部署应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

TL;DR: SemaMIL是一个新的多实例学习方法，通过语义重排序和语义引导检索状态空间模块，在计算病理学中实现了最先进的准确率，同时降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力MIL方法忽略上下文关系，Transformer模型计算成本高且容易过拟合，状态空间模型打乱补丁顺序会破坏组织学意义。需要一种既能保持语义关系又能高效建模的方法。

Method: 提出SemaMIL框架，包含语义重排序(SR)方法对语义相似的补丁进行聚类和排序，以及语义引导检索状态空间模块(SRSM)选择代表性查询子集来调整状态空间参数。

Result: 在四个WSI亚型数据集上的评估显示，SemaMIL相比强基线方法实现了最先进的准确率，同时使用更少的FLOPs和参数。

Conclusion: SemaMIL通过语义重排序和语义引导的状态空间建模，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，在计算病理学中提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过标签分布学习建模相邻年龄组的相关性，但忽视了不同年龄阶段存在不同程度的标签模糊性这一重要特征。

Method: SA-LDL算法基于嵌入相似性分析发现标签模糊性呈现明显的阶段性模式，采用阶段自适应方差建模和加权损失函数来捕捉标签模糊性的复杂结构化特征。

Result: 在MORPH-II数据集上MAE为1.74，在FG-NET数据集上MAE为2.15，表现出竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: SA-LDL通过建模标签模糊性的阶段性特征，实现了更准确和鲁棒的年龄估计，验证了阶段自适应方法的有效性。

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

Method: 基于Horn-Schunck光流方程分析ConvNets的作用，提出EOIR框架：使用3层ConvNet进行特征提取，构建拉普拉斯特征金字塔，通过3层光流估计器逐步组合微分同胚变形。

Result: 在5个不同模态和解剖区域的数据集上验证，EOIR实现了优越的精度-效率和精度-平滑度平衡，在可比精度下提供更好的效率和平滑度。

Conclusion: EOIR框架通过分离特征学习和光流估计，有效解决了大变形配准问题，在多个数据集上表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态奖励模型评估基准存在样本数量少、多样性不足、评估维度不全面等问题，需要构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 通过AI辅助数据管道构建包含1,563个标注样本的高质量偏好数据集，每个样本包含视频-文本提示、选择响应和拒绝响应的三元组，评估了生成式、判别式和半标量三类共28个多模态奖励模型。

Result: 最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到57.0%的总体准确率，开源最佳模型Qwen2.5-VL-72B为53.3%。研究发现：RL训练不一定带来更强的跨模态泛化能力；除判别式模型外，其他类型模型都能从推理时缩放中受益；不同视频帧数对不同类型模型影响不同。

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench为视频领域多模态奖励模型的评估和发展提供了具有挑战性和价值的基准测试平台，揭示了当前模型的局限性并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂场景中视频数据的爆炸式增长，快速检索群体活动成为迫切需求。现有方法只能检索整个视频，无法实现活动粒度的检索。

Method: STVH通过统一框架同时建模个体对象动态和群体交互，捕捉群体视觉特征和位置特征的时空演化。M-STVH作为增强版本，通过多焦点表示学习实现分层特征集成，能够同时关注活动语义特征和对象视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上的对比实验表明，STVH和M-STVH都能取得优异的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的STVH和M-STVH方法有效解决了群体活动细粒度视频检索问题，能够满足不同检索需求。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Method: 提出token驱动的双流框架，包含数据视角选择合适目标token和模型视角识别最优目标token，并注入辅助提示来匹配内容表示

Result: 在超声数据集上的实验表明，TRUST在视觉质量和下游任务性能方面均优于现有UI2I方法

Conclusion: TRUST框架通过有效分离内容和风格特征，显著提升了跨设备超声图像的下游任务性能

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Motivation: AI即服务的普及使得预训练模型通过API提供，但无法获取模型权重、训练数据或logits，当前领域自适应方法在这种黑盒约束下不适用。需要一种仅使用one-hot预测就能有效训练本地模型的方法。

Conclusion: ATGC方法成功解决了开放词汇模型在不同分辨率下的敏感性问题，为仅使用one-hot预测的黑盒模型蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案，推动了AIaaS环境下本地模型适配的发展。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

Conclusion: LBD框架有效解决了类别增量语义分割中的语义纠缠问题，通过语言引导和原型解耦机制显著提升了性能

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

TL;DR: BrainFM是一个模态无关的多任务视觉基础模型，通过创新的"轻度到重度"生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，能够处理多种脑成像任务，对输入模态具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在校准医学成像（如CT）中表现优异，但在未校准模态（如MRI）中泛化能力差，对MR对比度、分辨率和方向差异敏感，限制了在多样化临床协议中的广泛应用。

Method: 提出"轻度到重度"主体内生成和"真实-合成"混合训练策略，使模型对获取图像的外观（模态、对比度、变形、分辨率、伪影）具有弹性。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上评估，证明BrainFM在所有任务和输入模态上都具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: BrainFM作为一个模态无关的基础模型，能够直接应用于多种脑成像基础任务，解决了现有方法在未校准模态中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)方法，通过交叉注意力机制将全局场景上下文与局部提案特征融合，在车辆损伤检测等细粒度目标检测任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiffusionDet方法在上下文相关场景中受限于局部特征条件，性能有限，需要更好的全局上下文理解能力。

Method: 引入Context-Aware Fusion (CAF)，使用专门的编码器生成全局场景上下文，通过交叉注意力机制让每个目标提案都能关注到全面的环境信息。

Result: 在CarDD基准测试中超越了最先进模型，为细粒度领域的上下文感知目标检测建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: CAF框架通过全局上下文融合显著增强了生成式检测范式的性能，在具有挑战性的视觉领域中表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在遥感图像分割中的迁移问题，通过解耦和对齐策略实现了准确且可解释的多模态理解。

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，需要及时检测以有效减缓气候变化。传统方法依赖图像预处理步骤如正交校正，这些步骤增加了计算成本和延迟。

Method: 使用未正交校正的EMIT传感器高光谱数据训练机器学习模型，避免了传统的正交校正和匹配滤波器预处理步骤。

Result: 在未正交校正数据上训练的ML模型性能与正交校正数据训练的模型相当，且两种ML方法都优于传统的匹配滤波器基线(mag1c)。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了直接在未预处理数据上训练ML模型的可行性，为星载快速甲烷检测提供了更高效的解决方案，减少了计算成本和延迟。

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

TL;DR: MV-SSM是一个新颖的多视角状态空间建模框架，通过投影状态空间块和网格令牌引导的双向扫描技术，显著提升了多视角3D人体姿态估计的泛化能力，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于注意力机制的transformer在多视角3D人体姿态估计中存在两个主要问题：1）难以准确建模关键点的空间排列，特别是在遮挡场景下；2）容易过拟合训练数据中的特定相机配置和视觉场景，导致在新设置下性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出了MV-SSM框架，在两个层次上显式建模关节空间序列：多视角图像的特征层次和人体关键点层次。设计了投影状态空间（PSS）块来学习关节空间排列的泛化表示，并改进了Mamba的传统扫描方式为网格令牌引导的双向扫描（GTBS）。

Result: 在多个实验中表现出强大的泛化能力：在CMU Panoptic的三相机设置上AP25提升10.8（+24%），在变化相机配置上AP25提升7.0（+13%），在跨数据集评估的Campus A1上PCP提升15.3（+38%）。

Conclusion: MV-SSM框架通过状态空间建模和创新的扫描机制，有效解决了多视角3D人体姿态估计中的泛化问题，在多个挑战性场景下都显著优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP
(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations. Project Website:

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂语义理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确细节感知的基础视觉任务上存在不足，主要源于单一视觉编码器架构牺牲了细粒度视觉信息捕获能力

Method: 提出FtZ视觉塔框架，创新性地通过轻量级多头交叉注意力机制将语义强大的锚定编码器与感知丰富的增强编码器组合

Result: 在TextVQA、POPE、MMMU、MME和MM-Vet等需要细粒度视觉理解的基准测试中，FtZ模型显著优于仅使用单一编码器或现有特征融合方法的基线

Conclusion: 组合异构专家编码器是克服当前MLLMs视觉感知瓶颈的高效有效途径，为构建具有更强感知能力的下一代AI系统提供了新的设计范式

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出STM策略，通过参数高效微调视觉基础模型，仅使用少量正常天气数据实现恶劣天气下的单目深度估计，在多个真实基准测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件下的单目深度估计面临缺乏可靠真值和难以从无标签真实数据学习的挑战，现有方法存在域差距或违反光度假设的问题

Method: 引入选择-调优-保持(STM)策略，基于熵秩和稳定秩结构分解预训练权重，自适应选择秩数和任务感知奇异方向进行初始化，并实施主方向正则化

Result: 在四个真实世界基准测试中，STM不仅优于现有PEFT方法和全微调，还超过了使用恶劣合成数据训练的方法，甚至超越了深度基础模型

Conclusion: STM策略能够保证灵活的任务适应同时保持预训练VFM的强大泛化能力，为恶劣天气条件下的深度估计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多模态视觉-语言模型训练方法，通过将评分器模型的偏好数据重新组织为可验证的训练信号，直接在基础生成模型上进行强化学习。这个方法产生的LLaVA-Critic-R1模型既是一个高性能评分器，也是一个竞争力强的策略模型，在26个视觉理解和推理测试中超过了专门训练的VLM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，评分器模型和策略模型是分离的，评分器只用于评估输出而不用于生成响应。这项工作挖掘了评分器模型的潜力，诉求将其直接用于策略生成，以实现统一的模型既能评估又能生成。

Method: 将偏好标签的评分器数据集重新组织为可验证的训练信号，然后在基础生成模型(Qwen-2.5-VL-7B)上进行强化学习训练。这个方法产生了LLaVA-Critic-R1模型，并在现有强大推理VLM上扩展得到LLaVA-Critic-R1+。

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1在26个视觉理解和推理测试中超过了专门训练的VLM模型，平均提升+5.7%。LLaVA-Critic-R1+在7B规模下在MMMU上达到了71.9的SoTA性能。测试时使用自我评估可在5个代表性推理任务上获得平均+13.8%的提升。

Conclusion: 通过在评分器数据上进行RL训练，可以产生一个统一的模型，同时在评估和生成两个方面都表现优异。这为构建可扩展的自我改进多模态系统提供了简单有效的路径。

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Conclusion: CSFMamba网络能够有效利用Mamba的低计算负担优势，通过跨态融合机制实现更强的全图理解能力，为遥感图像分类提供了一种高效的多模态特征融合方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint

representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: 投影层具有非平凡的泛化能力，无需显式对齐监督即可处理新概念，为有限对齐数据下的高效VLM训练提供了可能

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE方法通过有效感受野和输入归因技术，揭示视觉SAE特征的真实因果驱动因素，而非仅依赖激活位置，避免了传统激活图可能导致的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过检查特征激活最高的图像块来理解稀疏自编码器特征，但由于自注意力机制在整个图像中混合信息，激活块往往只是与特征触发共现而非因果关系，这可能导致对特征含义的错误解释。

Method: 提出因果特征解释(CaFE)方法，利用有效感受野(ERF)，将每个SAE特征激活视为目标，应用输入归因方法识别因果驱动该激活的图像块。

Result: 在CLIP-ViT特征上，ERF图经常与朴素激活图不同，揭示了隐藏的上下文依赖关系（如"咆哮面部"特征需要眼睛和鼻子的共现，而不仅仅是张开的嘴）。补丁插入测试证实CaFE比激活排序补丁更有效地恢复或抑制特征激活。

Conclusion: CaFE提供了更忠实和语义精确的视觉SAE特征解释，强调了仅依赖激活位置进行解释的风险，需要关注因果驱动因素而非简单的共现关系。

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言检索方法在处理描述抽象事件、隐含因果关系、时间上下文或包含长复杂叙述的标题时表现不足，需要理解视觉特征和潜在事件语义、上下文及现实世界知识

Method: 多阶段检索框架：密集文章检索（Qwen3）+事件感知语言模型重排序（Qwen3-Reranker）+高效图像收集+标题引导语义匹配（Qwen2-VL）+排名感知选择，使用RRF融合多配置输出

Result: 在EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge Track 2的私有测试集上获得top-1分数

Conclusion: 结合基于语言的推理和多模态检索的方法对于复杂真实世界图像理解是有效的

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined
message. We propose the first generalizable watermarking framework that enables
efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

TL;DR: 本文针对检测变换器在HOI检测中存在的"有毒兄弟"偏差问题，提出了两种新的去偏学习目标，显著提升了检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现检测变换器在处理人-物交互检测时存在"有毒兄弟"偏差问题，即相似但不同的HOI三元组在输入和输出端相互干扰竞争，导致学习效率降低

Method: 提出"对比后校准"和"合并后分割"两种去偏学习目标：前者采样错误HOI三元组并重建为正确样本；后者先学习兄弟类别共享特征，再细化组内区分

Result: 在HICO-Det数据集上显著超越基线方法(+9.18% mAP)和现有最佳方法(+3.59% mAP)，在各种设置下都表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法有效解决了HOI检测中的"有毒兄弟"偏差问题，为检测变换器在复杂交互识别任务中的应用提供了新思路

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Result: InterPose显著提升了最先进运动生成方法的性能，并实现了基于LLM的零样本人-物交互动画

Conclusion: InterPose数据集解决了人-物交互运动生成的数据瓶颈，为复杂3D场景中的真实交互动画提供了重要基础

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

Conclusion: 可取消产品量化框架为安全面部表征检索提供了一种高效的解决方案，有效解决了同态加密技术在实时应用中的效率问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on
various datasets and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively extract complete line segments from input images
compared to other advanced line segment detectors. The implementation is

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

Conclusion: OmniReason框架成功解决了自动驾驶中时空推理的关键限制，通过创新的数据集和架构设计，显著提升了模型在动态环境中的理解和决策能力，为未来自动驾驶系统的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在需要外部知识的视觉问答任务上表现有限，传统的单次检索框架往往无法获取足够的知识

Method: 提出多模态迭代RAG框架，利用累积的推理记录动态制定多查询，在异构知识库中进行联合搜索，并将新知识整合到推理记录中逐步优化理解

Result: 在Encyclopedic VQA、InfoSeek和OK-VQA等挑战性基准测试中，MI-RAG显著提高了检索召回率和答案准确性

Conclusion: MI-RAG为知识密集型视觉问答中的组合推理提供了一种可扩展的方法

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Motivation: 水下3D重建面临光线失真、浑浊和能见度限制等挑战，现有AI方法尚未充分利用语言模型与视觉处理的结合潜力。

Method: 将额外语义特征嵌入到每个高斯基元中，通过CLIP提取的语义特征进行监督，采用语义一致性损失和分阶段训练策略（从粗到细学习和后期参数优化）。

Conclusion: 该方法为水下探索和海洋感知应用提供了强有力的候选方案，实现了鲁棒和高保真的深海场景重建。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

Motivation: 胎儿超声标准面分类面临组织对比度低、边界模糊和操作者依赖性图像质量变化等挑战，需要一种能够提高图像识别性能的方法。

Method: 设计了一个浅层纹理敏感网络来预测临床可行的对比度参数，通过可微分映射将输入图像转换为多个对比度增强视图，并在下游分类器中融合这些视图。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

*Xinlei Liu,Tao Hu,Peng Yi,Weitao Han,Jichao Xie,Baolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为顺序差异最大化(SDM)的梯度对抗攻击方法，通过三层优化框架和定向概率差异比损失函数，在攻击性能和成本效益方面优于现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要高效的对抗攻击方法来评估计算机视觉模型的鲁棒性，重构对抗样本生成的优化目标为最大化非真实标签概率上界与真实标签概率之间的差异。

Method: 建立"循环-阶段-步骤"三层优化框架，初始阶段使用真实标签的负概率作为损失函数压缩解空间，后续阶段引入定向概率差异比(DPDR)损失函数逐步增加非真实标签概率上界。

Result: 实验表明SDM相比之前SOTA方法具有更强的攻击性能和更高的攻击成本效益，并且可以与对抗训练方法结合提升防御效果。

Conclusion: SDM方法在对抗攻击领域表现出优越性能，为模型鲁棒性评估提供了有效的工具，同时还能增强对抗训练的防御效果。

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is
available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Gabor滤波器和模糊U-Net-ViT模型的新方法，用于提高纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和可靠性，在多个数据集上平均AUC达到0.939


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统纹理缺陷检测方法在处理复杂纹理和噪声环境时性能有限，需要结合局部特征和全局处理能力来提升检测精度

Method: 使用U-Net进行局部特征训练，结合Vision Transformer进行全局处理；采用高斯滤波损失函数去除背景噪声；在训练过程中使用Salt-and-Pepper掩码强化纹理-缺陷边界；后处理阶段应用Gabor滤波器突出缺陷方向频率特征

Result: 在MVTec-AD、Surface Crack Detection和Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset等数据集上实现了0.939的平均AUC值，消融实验验证了最优滤波器尺寸和噪声概率对性能的提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合U-Net的局部特征学习和ViT的全局处理能力，配合Gabor滤波后处理，有效提升了纹理表面缺陷检测的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

*Zhijing Wu,Longguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的统一优化框架，通过将相机位姿作为可学习参数与3D高斯属性互补，来解决动态场景重建中运动模糊导致的位姿估计误差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用两步流水线（先估计相机位姿，再优化3D高斯），但运动模糊会破坏位姿估计，导致误差累积和重建质量下降。

Method: 将相机和物体运动重新表述为3D高斯的每个基元的SE(3)仿射变换，制定统一优化目标，并采用三阶段训练策略交替优化相机位姿和高斯参数。

Result: 在Stereo Blur数据集和真实世界序列上的实验表明，该方法在重建质量和位姿估计精度方面显著优于先前的动态去模糊方法。

Conclusion: 该统一优化框架通过端到端联合优化相机位姿和3D高斯属性，有效解决了运动模糊导致的动态3D场景重建问题，取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO是一个高效的分割框架，使用冻结的DINOv3主干网络和轻量级解码器，在多个分割基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖重型解码器进行多尺度融合或复杂上采样，带来大量参数开销和计算成本，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 从预训练编码器提取多级特征，对齐到共同分辨率和通道宽度，使用轻量级MLP头直接预测分割掩码

Result: 在6个基准测试（包括3个医学数据集和3个自然图像数据集）上一致达到最先进性能

Conclusion: SegDINO设计在最小化可训练参数的同时保持了基础特征的表示能力，提供了高效的语义分割解决方案

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

*Jongwook Si,Sungyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Swin Transformer和U-Net的混合去雾框架SUFERNOBWA，用于卫星图像去雾，在RICE和SateHaze1K数据集上取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气干扰和雾霾严重影响卫星图像的清晰度和信息提取精度，需要开发有效的去雾方法来提升卫星图像质量。

Method: 采用Swin Transformer和U-Net混合架构，使用SwinRRDB模块在编码器和解码器中提取特征，结合全局上下文学习和局部细节恢复，并设计了包含L2损失、引导损失和新型分水岭损失的复合损失函数。

Result: 在RICE数据集上达到PSNR 33.24 dB和SSIM 0.967的优异性能，显著优于现有方法，在两个数据集上都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法为减轻卫星图像大气干扰提供了有效解决方案，在多样化遥感应用中具有潜在适用性。

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将单视图新视角合成分解为360度场景外推和视角插值的两阶段方法，通过全景扩散模型和视频扩散模型确保长距离视角一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像新视角合成方法在长距离或闭环轨迹中难以保持视角一致性和正确对齐，需要解决大范围未观察区域的挑战

Method: 第一阶段使用全景扩散模型从输入图像学习场景先验，第二阶段从生成的全景图中采样关键帧，通过预训练的视频扩散模型进行空间噪声扩散来生成新视角

Result: 在多样化场景数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户定义轨迹上生成连贯视图方面优于现有方法，即使在闭环场景中也能保持全局一致性

Conclusion: 该方法通过场景外推和视角插值的分解策略，有效解决了单视图新视角合成的长距离一致性问题，同时支持灵活的相机控制

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FQAT方法，通过层间冻结机制和自适应冻结算法解决量化感知训练中的OOD泛化性能下降问题，在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法主要关注模型在分布内数据的性能，但忽视了在分布外数据上的性能下降问题。实验表明QAT会导致显著的OOD泛化性能退化。

Method: 提出FQAT方法：1）引入层间冻结机制缓解双优化目标之间的梯度冲突；2）提出基于梯度无序度度量的自适应冻结算法，动态确定每步训练中需要冻结的层

Result: 在权威OOD基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法在I.D和OOD图像分类任务上都优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: FQAT通过解决QAT导致的尖锐损失景观问题，成功实现了可泛化的量化感知训练，在保持I.D性能的同时显著提升了OOD泛化能力

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

*Zirui Zhou,Zizhao Peng,Dongyang Jin,Chao Fan,Fengwei An,Shiqi Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集和双重表征框架(DRF)，解决了基于姿态的特发性症筛查中的数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题，并通过结合连续骨枱图和离散不对称向量实现了独特的临床解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI特发性症筛查方法主要依靠大规模侧影数据集，忽视了临床相关的姿态不对称指标。而姿态数据虽然提供直观的骨枱表征，但因数据稀缺和噪声敏感问题导致基于姿态的特发性症筛查研究不足。

Method: 构建Scoliosis1K-Pose数据集（447,900帧2D关键点），提出双重表征框架(DRF)：结合连续骨枱图保持空间结构，离散姿态不对称向量(PAV)编码临床不对称描述符，以及PAV导向注意力(PGA)模块用于指导特征提取。

Result: DRF框架实现了犹怀性能能力，可视化结果证明模型利用了临床不对称线索来指导特征提取，促进双重表征之间的协同作用。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了基于姿态的特发性症筛查面临的挑战，通过创新的数据集和框架设计，提供了具有临床解释性的高效筛查方案，为医疗AI应用开启了新方向。

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spotlighter是一个轻量级的token选择框架，通过双重评估机制选择最重要的视觉token，在提升CLIP提示调优准确率的同时显著提高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP的提示调优虽然有效，但冗余和弱相关的特征组件会引入噪声并增加不必要的计算成本，需要一种既能提升准确性又能提高效率的方法

Method: 从样本层面和语义层面评估每个视觉token的激活度，只保留得分最高的token；使用类别特定的语义记忆库来精化选择；引入两级排序机制动态加权token-原型交互

Result: 在11个few-shot基准测试中，相比CLIP在调和平均准确率上提升达11.19%，额外实现0.8K FPS，仅增加21个参数

Conclusion: Spotlighter为提示调优提供了一个有效且可扩展的基准方法，在准确性和效率方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for
our method will be available at

Result: IPG生成泛化性好的补丁，有效覆盖更广泛的模型漏洞，生成的数据集可作为构建鲁棒模型的知识基础

Conclusion: IPG在对抗补丁防御和自动驾驶、安防系统、医疗成像等实际应用中具有巨大潜力

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

Conclusion: DarkVRAI通过协同结合条件化方案和BOSS机制，成功解决了低光RAW视频去噪的挑战性问题

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频令牌压缩方法采用固定压缩比例，忽略了不同视频片段语义密度的差异性，导致信息丰富片段表示不足而静态片段计算浪费。

Method: 使用轻量级语言模型将视频片段转换为软描述令牌作为视觉表示，通过语义密度感知监督训练，动态调整压缩比例基于场景丰富度（通过描述长度反映）。

Result: 实验结果显示方法相比VideoGPT+减少49%的FLOPs计算量，同时保持竞争性性能，并能根据视频片段丰富度自适应调整压缩比例。

Conclusion: LangDC模仿人类动态表达视觉信息的方式，实现了基于语义密度的动态令牌压缩，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然3DGS在RGB数据上表现优异，但在多谱数据上的每段独立优化会导致几何结构不一致的问题，需要找到有效的多模态集成方法

Method: 评估了三种策略：1）每段独立重建 2）分段优化（先RGB后其他波段） 3）聚合优化策略，将多谱数据直接集成到球面调和颜色组件中

Result: 聚合优化策略在数量指标咄质量新视角渲染上都表现最佳，提高了谱系重建质量并通过谱间交互增强RGB结果

Conclusion: 建议将多谱数据直接集成到球面调和颜色组件中，以简洁地模型每个高斯的多谱反射特性，并提供了优化过程中引入谱段的关键交易选择

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,
offering practical insights for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral
species within the next decade. Restoration efforts are crucial, but their
success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,
sub-image patch classification of 89.1%, and real-time model inference at 5.5
frames per second. Further, we present and publicly contribute a large

Motivation: 现有的基于滑块的文本到图像生成方法通常为每个属性单独训练适配器，忽略了多个属性之间的纠缠问题，导致不同属性之间产生干扰，无法同时精确控制多个属性。

Method: 提出CompSlider方法，在条件先验的潜在空间中操作，通过新颖的解耦损失和结构损失来组合多个属性变化，同时保持图像结构一致性，无需重新训练基础模型。

Result: 该方法能够可靠且独立地操纵多个属性，在多种图像属性上表现良好，并可扩展到视频生成领域，同时降低了训练和推理的计算负担。

Conclusion: CompSlider通过解耦多个属性和结构一致性保持，实现了更可靠的基于滑块的多属性同时控制，为文本到图像生成提供了更精确的属性操控能力。

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于去除玻璃表面各种污染物（如泥水、灰尘等）的图像恢复方法，通过一次性测试时自适应机制和自监督辅助学习任务来处理真实世界中的复杂遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖合成数据或仅处理雨滴污染，而现实中的玻璃污染物种类更多样（如泥水、灰尘等），需要更强大的方法来处理这些复杂的真实污染情况。

Method: 采用一次性测试时自适应机制，通过自监督辅助学习任务来更新训练好的模型，以适应每个测试图像独特的污染类型，使用真实配对的污染/清洁图像进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都优于现有最先进方法，特别是在处理未见过的污染类型时表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的全合一模型能够有效处理多种类型的玻璃污染物，通过测试时自适应机制显著提升了真实污染图像的恢复效果，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实病理图像存在噪声、模糊、低分辨率等退化问题，现有方法缺乏处理多样化低级视觉挑战的通用性，物理染色成本高且不一致。

Method: 使用对比预训练编码器从1.9亿未标记病理图像学习可迁移特征，通过统一条件扩散过程和文本提示动态适应特定任务。

Conclusion: LPFM为病理学图像处理提供了统一的解决方案，能够有效处理多种低级视觉任务，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

Motivation: 医学图像异常检测需要高效率和准确性，但CNN感受野有限，Transformer计算成本过高。Mamba的长序列处理能力和线性复杂度为此提供了新的解决方案。

Method: 提出SpectMamba架构，包含混合空间-频率注意力块(HSFA)分离学习高低频特征，视觉状态空间模块(VSSM)和Hilbert曲线扫描技术增强空间相关性和局部依赖。

Conclusion: SpectMamba成功将Mamba架构应用于医学图像检测，通过频域特征与空间特征的结合，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为医学图像分析提供了新的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散Transformer模型在生成高质量视频时面临计算复杂度高的问题，全注意力的二次复杂度导致训练和推理成本过高，需要解决查询和键值对的稀疏性问题

Method: 使用双向稀疏注意力框架，通过语义相似性选择最信息丰富的查询token，采用动态时空训练策略，并通过统计动态阈值保留最显著的KV块

Result: BSA显著加速了DiT训练，FLOPs减少高达20倍，注意力训练速度提升17.79倍，同时保持甚至超越了全注意力的生成质量

Conclusion: BSA框架有效解决了视频DiT模型的计算效率问题，在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升了训练和推理速度

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

TL;DR: VEPE是一个端到端的视频姿态估计框架，通过时空Transformer组件和实例一致性机制，解决了传统两阶段方法效率低和时空上下文分离的问题，在Posetrack数据集上性能优越且推理效率提升300%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频姿态估计方法采用两阶段流程（检测+时序建模），存在时空维度分离、无法端到端优化、依赖复杂后处理（RoI裁剪、NMS）导致推理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出VEPE框架，包含三个核心时空Transformer组件：STPE（时空姿态编码器）、STDME（时空可变形记忆编码器）、STPD（时空姿态解码器），并引入实例一致性机制来增强跨帧实例查询的一致性和差异性，实现实例跟踪功能。

Result: 在Posetrack数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法优于大多数两阶段模型，推理效率提升了300%。

Conclusion: VEPE提供了一个简单灵活的端到端视频姿态估计解决方案，有效利用时序上下文优化人体姿态估计，同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: PVINet通过并行处理全局和局部特征并实现有效交互，提升了点云压缩的重建质量。

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有布局到图像生成方法在退化场景（如低光、水下）中存在生成保真度有限和与用户提供布局对齐度弱的问题，主要归因于上下文幻觉困境。

Method: 提出频率启发的上下文解缠生成范式FICGen：1）可学习双查询机制提取上下文频率原型；2）视觉频率增强注意力注入频率原型；3）实例一致性图和自适应空间频率聚合模块实现解缠和重建。

Result: 在5个基准测试上（从严重低光到轻度模糊的各种退化场景）的实验表明，FICGen在生成保真度、对齐度和下游辅助可训练性方面持续超越现有L2I方法。

Conclusion: FICGen通过频率知识迁移和上下文解缠机制，有效解决了退化场景下的布局到图像生成问题，为相关应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

Conclusion: GPSToken通过高斯参数化空间自适应标记化，实现了非均匀图像表示，解耦了空间布局和纹理特征，支持高效的两阶段生成流程。

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法主要关注生成参考预测的策略，但忽视了标注数据中的潜在噪声和不同未标注像素的异质性价值。需要更有效地挖掘两个预测中的丰富信息。

Method: 基于空间异质性损失框架，将未标注数据的预测分为四个区域（UC、US、DC、DS），根据置信度和一致性分配递减权重。提出自适应阈值区分置信预测和可疑预测，并将该损失应用于标注图像以应对标注噪声。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法与现有SSL框架集成后，在不同数据集上显著提高了分割性能。

Conclusion: MetaSSL是一个即插即用的通用框架，通过有效利用预测中的不确定性和一致性信息，能够显著提升半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 通过实证研究分析流行视觉编码器在识别关键帧方面的能力局限。

Result: 发现当前视觉编码器在确定MLLM应该关注视频中哪些位置以恰当处理文本查询方面存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的关键帧识别技术来支持高效视频多模态大语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video

*Junxiang Liu,Junming Lin,Jiangtong Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind是一个从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景的新框架，通过联合建模神经动力学和语义特征，在视频重建精度和视觉保真度方面实现了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从EEG信号重建动态视觉场景时面临空间分辨率低、时间不匹配和语义信息利用不足的问题，无法充分解析视觉刺激的动态连贯性和复杂语义上下文

Method: 提出DynaMind框架，包含三个核心模块：区域感知语义映射器(RSM)提取多模态语义特征，时间感知动态对齐器(TDA)生成动态潜在序列确保时间一致性，双引导视频重建器(DGVR)将时序蓝图转换为高保真视频

Result: 在SEED-DV数据集上达到新的SOTA性能，视频和帧级重建精度分别提升12.5和10.3个百分点，SSIM提升9.4%，FVMD降低19.7%，显示出卓越的视觉保真度和时间连贯性

Conclusion: 这项工作在神经动力学和高保真视觉语义之间架起了关键桥梁，标志着脑解码领域的重要进展

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusDPO是一个多主体个性化图像生成框架，通过动态语义对应和自适应焦点区域识别，有效防止属性泄漏并保持主体保真度，无需测试时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多主体个性化图像生成需要在不进行测试时优化的情况下，合成包含多个指定主体的定制图像，但现有方法在保持主体保真度和防止跨主体属性泄漏方面存在困难。

Method: 基于动态语义对应和参考图像复杂度自适应识别焦点区域，在训练过程中根据噪声时间步逐步调整焦点区域，采用加权策略奖励信息丰富区域并惩罚低置信度区域。

Result: 在单主体和多主体个性化图像合成基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升现有预训练个性化生成模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解属性泄漏问题，在不同生成场景下保持优异的主体保真度，推动了可控多主体图像合成的前沿发展。

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Conclusion: SegAssess通过PQM新范式为无监督分割质量评估提供了一种健壮且可迁移的解决方案，有效充分判断正确和错误分割像素。

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same
experiments but on fewer bands (red, green, blue only), by around $30\%$. This
dataset is publicly available on \href{URL}{HuggingFace}, and both processing
and training codebases are available on \href{URL}{GitHub}.

Conclusion: DcMatch通过利用形状集合的流形结构和双域一致性约束，实现了更准确和一致的非刚性多形状匹配，为计算机视觉和图形学中的对应关系建立提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of
computational pathology.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

Conclusion: 交叉重建显著增加了预训练难度，使该方法在3D自监督学习中超越了之前的单模态自重建方法，证明了双视图学习的潜力。

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which
enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods
in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the
self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three
variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is

*Thinh-Phuc Nguyen,Thanh-Hai Nguyen,Gia-Huy Dinh,Lam-Huy Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran,Trung-Nghia Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCap是一个新颖的事件增强图像检索和描述系统，通过整合相关文章的背景信息来生成叙事丰富、事实准确的字幕，解决了传统视觉语言模型缺乏时间、社会和历史背景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像描述系统往往产生通用描述，无法捕捉事件级别的语义信息，这对于新闻报道和数字存档等应用至关重要。现有视觉语言模型通常只关注可见内容，而忽略了时间、社会和历史背景。

Method: ReCap包含三个集成组件：(1)使用DINOv2嵌入的两阶段文章检索系统，先通过全局特征相似性选择候选，再用补丁级互近邻相似性重新排序；(2)从文章摘要、通用描述和原始元数据中合成信息的上下文提取框架；(3)基于大型语言模型的字幕生成系统，采用语义高斯归一化来增强流畅性和相关性。

Result: 在EVENTA 2025大挑战赛Track 1的OpenEvents V1数据集上评估，ReCap获得了0.54666的总体得分，在私有测试集上排名第二。

Conclusion: ReCap有效桥接了视觉感知与现实世界知识，为高风险领域中的上下文感知图像理解提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

TL;DR: X-Agent是一个创新的开放词汇语义分割框架，通过潜在语义感知的"代理"来协调跨模态注意力机制，在基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割中，基础类别训练和开放词汇推理之间的领域差异给潜在未见类别的判别建模带来挑战，现有方法对潜在语义理解机制探索不足。

Method: 提出X-Agent框架，采用潜在语义感知的"代理"来协调跨模态注意力机制，同时优化潜在语义动态并增强其可感知性。

Result: 广泛的基准评估表明，X-Agent实现了最先进的性能，同时有效增强了潜在语义的显著性。

Conclusion: X-Agent通过探索视觉语言模型中潜在语义的分布模式和动态，提出了一种有效的开放词汇语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Motivation: SAR目标检测面临散斑噪声、小目标模糊性和机载计算限制等挑战，现有方法主要关注SAR特定的架构修改，本文探索利用现有轻量级检测器YOLOv10并通过NAS提升其性能。

Method: 采用神经架构搜索(NAS)系统优化网络结构，特别是骨干网络架构搜索。构建广泛的搜索空间并利用进化搜索，找到在精度、参数效率和计算成本之间平衡的优化架构。

Result: 在大规模SARDet-100K数据集上的实验结果表明，优化模型优于现有SAR检测方法，实现了更高的检测精度，同时保持较低的计算开销。

Conclusion: 这项工作为利用NAS解决实际应用问题提供了新的视角，首次将NAS引入SAR目标检测领域，展示了NAS在优化检测器架构方面的有效性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该模型在准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为雷达目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

*Huan Ni,Qingshan Liu,Xiaonan Niu,Danfeng Hong,Lingli Zhao,Haiyan Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FSS-TIs方法，使用常微分方程和傅里叶变换构建一体化模块，解决跨域小样本分割中模块独立导致知识流动不畅的问题，在多个跨域数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域小样本分割方法通常设计多个独立模块来增强特征表示的跨域泛化能力，但这些模块之间的独立性阻碍了知识的有效流动，难以充分发挥它们的集体潜力。

Method: 提出基于常微分方程和傅里叶变换的一体化模块FSS-TIs，假设域特定特征和域无关特征的光谱之间存在ODE关系，通过时间间隔序列的迭代变换过程，同时对光谱应用带有随机扰动的仿射变换。

Result: 在五个不同领域的跨域数据集上评估，实验结果表明FSS-TIs优于现有的CD-FSS方法，深入的消融研究进一步验证了其跨域适应性。

Conclusion: FSS-TIs通过ODE和傅里叶变换将域无关特征表示空间的探索和多样化潜在目标域分布的模拟重新表述为ODE内在参数的优化过程，实现了结构简洁且性能优越的跨域小样本分割。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

*Alexandros Gkillas,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个端到端框架，联合处理LiDAR超分辨率和语义分割，通过轻量级架构实现与64通道高分辨率LiDAR相当的语义分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率LiDAR成本高昂限制了大规模部署，而低成本16通道LiDAR产生的稀疏点云会降低分割精度，需要解决这一矛盾

Method: 采用联合优化训练框架，SR模块融入语义线索并保留细节；提出新的SR损失函数关注感兴趣区域；轻量级基于模型的SR架构参数少且易于与分割网络兼容

Result: 实验表明该方法在语义分割性能上可与使用昂贵64通道高分辨率LiDAR数据的模型相媲美

Conclusion: 该联合框架成功解决了低成本稀疏LiDAR数据的分割精度问题，为自动驾驶大规模部署提供了经济有效的解决方案

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

TL;DR: PGRD是一个基于扩散模型的医学图像分割框架，通过先验引导和残差学习来捕捉体素级分布，提高校准性和采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割存在模糊性，需要模型捕捉完整的条件分布而非单点估计，现有方法在校准性和效率方面存在不足

Method: 将离散标签嵌入连续空间对齐分割与扩散建模，使用粗粒度先验预测器提供逐步指导，扩散网络学习残差加速收敛，采用深度扩散监督稳定训练

Result: 在MRI和CT数据集上评估，相比贝叶斯、集成、Probabilistic U-Net和普通扩散基线，获得更高的Dice分数和更低的NLL/ECE值，且需要更少采样步骤

Conclusion: PGRD框架在医学图像分割中能够有效捕捉不确定性，同时保持强校准性和实用采样效率，优于现有概率分割方法

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Conclusion: 这篇论文证明了检索增强生成基于多模态大语言模型在地理定位估计中的有效性，为传统从头开始训练模型的方法提供了一条替代路径，为GeoAI领域开启了更可访问和可扩展解决方案的新可能性。

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable
solution for real-time decision support in precision agriculture and paves the
way for future lightweight multimodal AI systems in resource-constrained

TL;DR: M3Ret是一个统一的多模态医学图像检索模型，通过自监督学习在包含2D、3D和视频的混合数据集上训练，无需模态特定定制，在零样本检索和跨模态对齐方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像检索方法针对不同模态使用分离的架构和训练策略，这种模态特定的设计限制了可扩展性，阻碍了统一表示的发展。

Method: 构建包含867,653个医学影像样本的大规模混合模态数据集，使用生成式(MAE)和对比式(SimDINO)自监督学习范式训练统一的视觉编码器M3Ret，无需任何模态特定定制。

Result: 在所有单个模态的零样本图像检索中达到最先进水平，超越DINOv3和BMC-CLIP等基线方法；在没有配对数据的情况下实现强跨模态对齐；在未见过的MRI任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: M3Ret为医学成像社区提供了一个有前景的基础模型，展示了纯视觉自监督学习对未见模态的泛化能力，是多模态医学图像理解向基础模型迈进的一步。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

Conclusion: TPIGE框架以最小成本实现了身份保持文本到视频生成的显著性能提升，为相关领域提供了有效的训练免费解决方案

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Low light conditions significantly degrade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
performance in critical applications. Existing Low-light Image Enhancement
(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: RAL框架通过概率建模和置信门控机制解决部分相关视频检索中的不确定性挑战，提升跨模态对齐的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRVR方法容易受到虚假语义相关性的干扰，存在查询歧义和视频部分相关性带来的数据不确定性挑战

Method: 1) 将视频和查询编码为多元高斯分布进行概率建模 2) 引入可学习的置信门控动态加权相似度 3) 作为即插即用方案集成到现有架构

Result: 在多种检索骨干网络上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: RAL框架通过显式建模数据不确定性，有效提升了部分相关视频检索的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RibPull是一种利用隐式占据场连接计算几何和医学影像的方法，通过神经占据场表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩提取中轴，相比体素方法能更好地处理稀疏数据和几何操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素网格在医学影像中存在分辨率限制、拓扑信息丢失和稀疏数据处理效率低的问题，而基于坐标的隐式表示能更好地保持复杂几何信息并处理稀疏数据。

Method: 使用神经占据场预测3D点是否在物体内部来表示CT扫描的胸腔，并应用拉普拉斯收缩算法提取胸腔的中轴线。

Result: 在RibSeg数据集的20个医学扫描上进行了评估，证明了连续坐标基3D场景表示相对于体素基表示的优越性。

Conclusion: 隐式占据场为医学影像中的几何操作提供了更好的解决方案，能够有效处理稀疏噪声数据并保持几何完整性。

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

TL;DR: NSD是一个新颖的图像编辑框架，通过并行交叉注意力机制和渐进式自风格表示学习模块，在保持语义控制的同时确保风格一致性，并建立了全面的评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法主要关注语义控制，但忽视了保持风格一致性的重要性，这影响了图像的整体美感和连贯性。

Method: 提出神经场景设计器(NSD)框架，采用并行交叉注意力机制分别处理文本和风格信息，并设计渐进式自风格表示学习(PSRL)模块，通过风格对比损失学习细粒度风格表示。

Result: 在建立的综合基准测试中进行了大量实验，证明了所提框架的有效性。

Conclusion: NSD框架成功解决了图像编辑中的风格一致性问题，为语义控制和风格保持提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

TL;DR: MILO是一个轻量级的多尺度感知度量，用于全参考图像质量评估，既可作为先进的图像质量指标，也可作为生成管道中感知优化的实用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统图像质量评估方法需要大规模人工标注数据集的问题，以及提供既准确又高效的实时应用解决方案。

Method: 使用伪MOS监督训练，通过对多样图像应用可复现的失真并使用考虑视觉掩蔽效应的质量度量集合进行评分。在潜在域优化中结合空间掩蔽和课程学习策略。

Result: MILO在标准FR-IQA基准测试中优于现有指标，推理速度快，适用于实时应用。在去噪、超分辨率和面部修复等任务中显著提升性能，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: MILO不仅是一个最先进的图像质量度量标准，还是一个实用的感知优化工具，特别适用于生成模型管道中的高效优化。

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

Conclusion: InfoScale通过信息中心化的方法有效解决了扩散模型在变尺度图像生成中的关键问题，为多分辨率图像生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced
visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in

each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Images vary in how memorable they are to humans. Inspired by findings from
cognitive science and computer vision, this paper explores the correlates of
image memorability in pretrained vision encoders, focusing on latent
activations, attention distributions, and the uniformity of image patches. We
find that these features correlate with memorability to some extent.
Additionally, we explore sparse autoencoder loss over the representations of
vision transformers as a proxy for memorability, which yields results
outperforming past methods using convolutional neural network representations.
Our results shed light on the relationship between model-internal features and
memorability. They show that some features are informative predictors of what
makes images memorable to humans.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Motivation: 解决现有体素方法精度高但推理慢、柱状方法速度快但精度不足的问题，寻求在自动驾驶3D目标检测中平衡精度和速度的新方案。

Method: 提出PointSlice方法：1）将3D点云沿水平面切片转换为多组2D数据，模型仅学习2D分布；2）引入Slice Interaction Network（SIN）保持切片间垂直关系，增强3D感知能力。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上比SAFDNet快1.13倍，参数量减少0.79倍，精度仅降低1.2 mAPH；在nuScenes数据集达到66.74 mAP的SOTA结果；在Argoverse 2数据集快1.10倍，参数量减少0.66倍，精度降低1.0 mAP。

Conclusion: PointSlice通过创新的点云切片处理和SIN网络，成功实现了高检测精度和快速推理的平衡，为3D目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet
benchmark show that ConTiCoM-3D matches or outperforms state-of-the-art
diffusion and latent consistency models in both quality and efficiency,
establishing it as a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation.

Result: 在Synapse、ACDC、Kvasir和ISIC2017数据集上分别获得86.49%、92.56%、93.37%和92.98%的Dice系数。

Conclusion: MSA2-Net在多种医学图像分割任务中表现出优异的鲁棒性和精确性，证明了自适应卷积模块的有效性。

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving
Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the
Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets,
respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical
image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

TL;DR: V²Drop是一种基于视觉token变化的压缩方法，通过在推理过程中逐步移除变化最小的视觉token，显著提升大视觉语言模型的推理效率，同时保持原始性能的94-98.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像和长视频理解导致token数量激增，降低推理效率。现有方法存在位置偏差和与高效算子不兼容的问题，限制了实际部署。

Method: 从token变化角度出发，发现视觉token变化具有任务无关性，提出V²Drop方法，在推理过程中逐步移除变化最小的视觉token。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，V²Drop将图像和视频理解任务的LLM生成延迟分别降低31.5%和74.2%，同时保持原始性能的94.0%和98.6%。与高效算子结合后还能进一步降低GPU峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: V²Drop提供了一种有效的token压缩解决方案，显著提升大视觉语言模型的推理效率，同时保持高性能，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在放射学中缺乏临床所需的判别精度，且公开的3D CT数据集存在稀缺性和异质性，标注格式和粒度差异大，需要解决这些限制。

Method: 开发Uniferum体积VLM，统一分类标签和分割掩码等多样化监督信号，协调三个具有不同标注的公共3D CT数据集，构建单一训练框架。

Result: 在CT-RATE基准测试中AUROC比CLIP基线和传统多标签卷积模型提高7%，在RAD-CHEST和INSPECT数据集上展现出意外的零样本性能，具有强大的分布外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 整合异质标注和身体分割能有效提升模型性能，为3D医学影像中临床可靠、数据高效的VLMs设定了新方向。

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

TL;DR: HIFU-ILDiff是一种基于潜在扩散模型的深度学习新方法，能够实时抑制超声引导HIFU治疗中的干扰，显著优于传统陷波滤波器方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高强度聚焦超声(HIFU)治疗需要实时监测，但超声引导时存在干扰问题，影响治疗成功率和安全性。

Method: 使用向量量化变分自编码器(VQ-VAE)将含噪超声图像编码到低维潜在空间，然后通过潜在扩散模型迭代去除干扰，最后解码重建高质量无干扰图像。

Result: 在体外实验中，HIFU-ILDiff达到SSIM 0.796和PSNR 23.780，远超陷波滤波器的SSIM 0.443和PSNR 14.420，处理速度达15帧/秒，比陷波滤波器快300倍。

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff能够实时去噪超声引导图像中的HIFU干扰，将显著提高当前临床应用中HIFU治疗的精确度。

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理视频内容时面临空间分辨率和时间覆盖之间的权衡问题，视频理解仍然是一个具有挑战性的领域，因为视频具有动态和信息密集的特性。

Method: 1) 新颖的Slow-Fast视频编码策略，基于帧间相似性动态分配计算资源；2) 渐进式四阶段预训练方法，将上下文长度从8K扩展到128K tokens；3) 综合后训练流程，包括5步思维链数据构建、基于GSPO的迭代强化学习和对齐训练。

Result: 在公共基准测试和严格的内部人工评估中，Keye-VL-1.5相比现有模型展现出显著改进，特别是在视频理解任务上表现卓越，同时在通用多模态基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5通过三项关键技术创新成功解决了视频理解中的基本挑战，为动态视频内容的处理提供了有效的解决方案，在视频理解领域取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

TL;DR: ViSTA-SLAM是一个无需相机内参的实时单目视觉SLAM系统，采用轻量级对称双视图关联模型作为前端，后端构建专门的Sim(3)位姿图，在相机跟踪和3D重建质量方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不需要相机内参的通用视觉SLAM系统，使其能够适用于各种不同的相机设置，同时保持轻量级和高性能。

Method: 使用轻量级对称双视图关联(STA)模型作为前端，仅从两张RGB图像同时估计相对相机位姿和回归局部点云图；后端构建包含闭环检测的Sim(3)位姿图来处理累积漂移。

Result: 前端模型大小仅为同类最先进方法的35%，显著降低了模型复杂度，同时在相机跟踪和密集3D重建质量方面实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM提供了一个高效、通用的视觉SLAM解决方案，在不依赖相机内参的情况下实现了优异的性能，适用于各种相机配置。

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both
camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current
methods. Github repository: https://github.com/zhangganlin/vista-slam

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在视频编辑中面临挑战，需要为不同编辑任务设计不同的控制信号，导致模型设计复杂且需要大量训练资源。

Method: 提出基于随机和自适应噪声的对象失真控制信号(O-DisCo)，能够灵活封装多种编辑线索；配合复制形式保护模块来保留未编辑区域；采用有效的训练范式。

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit提供了一个统一的框架，能够高效处理多样化的视频编辑任务，在保持高质量的同时简化了模型设计。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable
editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse
object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse
editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training
resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that
incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on
random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues
within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that
O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods
across various video editing tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于CNN的多任务深度学习模型在导管手术中提供触觉和视觉感知数据，但需要逐步扩展感受野。本文从新视角出发，利用Transformer捕获长距离依赖关系

Method: 使用Vision Transformer编码器-解码器架构，将双视角X光图像作为独立序列处理，通过共享分割头和回归头分别实现导管分割和3D力估计

Result: 在多种噪声水平的合成X光图像上进行广泛实验，相比纯分割模型、视觉导管力估计方法和多任务方法，在导管分割和力估计两方面均达到新的state-of-the-art

Conclusion: 提出的立体视觉Transformer模型能够同时从两个角度分割导管并估计其尖端3D力，为导管手术提供了更有效的多任务感知解决方案

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Result: 在15个基准测试中平均得分从48%提升到57%，显著改善模型性能

Conclusion: Panel-of-Peers框架证明了同行评估作为自监督对齐的可扩展替代方案的潜力，能够有效提升模型性能而无需大量人工标注数据

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to
57%

TL;DR: Q-Sched是一种新的后训练量化方法，通过调整扩散模型调度器而非模型权重，在4倍模型压缩下实现全精度准确率，显著提升few-step扩散模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型计算成本高昂，few-step模型虽然减少了去噪步骤但仍依赖大型未压缩的骨干网络，限制了在非数据中心GPU上的部署和现有后训练量化方法的效果。

Method: 提出Q-Sched范式，通过修改扩散模型调度器来调整few-step采样轨迹；设计JAQ损失函数，结合文本-图像兼容性和图像质量指标进行细粒度优化，实现无需参考图像和全精度推理的校准。

Result: 相比FP16 4步潜在一致性模型提升15.5% FID，相比FP16 8步分阶段一致性模型提升16.6% FID；大规模用户研究（超过80,000个标注）在FLUX.1和SDXL-Turbo上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 量化与few-step蒸馏在高保真生成中是互补的，Q-Sched为高效扩散模型部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Motivation: 提升OpenVision的训练效率，减少训练时间和内存消耗，同时保持多模态性能。

Method: 移除文本编码器和对比损失，仅使用生成式标题损失进行纯生成式训练。

Result: 训练时间减少1.5倍（83h→57h），内存使用减少1.8倍（24.5GB→13.8GB），批量大小从2k增至8k，参数量可扩展至10亿以上，性能与原版相当。

Conclusion: 轻量级的纯生成式范式对未来多模态基础模型中视觉编码器的发展具有重要价值。

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,
BLINK and MMStar, significantly outperforming the supervised and text-based RL
finetuning baselines. Notably, Our ReVPT-3B and ReVPT-7B outperform the

rendering of people in real-time. We introduce a novel Gaussian splatting
densification strategy to build Gaussian points from the surface of cylindrical
structures around estimated skeletal limbs. Given the camera calibration, we
render an accurate semantic segmentation with our novel view segmentation
module. Finally, a UNet generator uses the rendered Gaussian splatting features
and the segmentation maps to create photorealistic digital avatars. Our method
runs in real-time with a rendering speed of 79 FPS. It outperforms previous
methods regarding visual perception and quality, achieving a state-of-the-art
results in terms of a pixel fidelity of 32.94db on the ZJU Mocap dataset and
33.39db on the Thuman4 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱图像数据维度高、处理复杂，多标签分类进一步增加了特征提取的难度，需要研究降维技术的有效性

Method: 构建包含可选PCA步骤的流水线，将数据降维至3维后输入三层分类器，比较ResNet50和DINOv2两种深度学习架构

Result: PCA对多标签多光谱图像分类的效果强烈依赖于所选的深度学习架构和训练策略

Conclusion: 研究结果为自监督预训练和替代降维方法的未来研究开辟了新途径

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated
processing challenges. Multi-label classification, where each image may belong
to multiple classes, adds further complexity to feature extraction. Our
pipeline includes an optional PCA step that reduces the data to three
dimensions before feeding it into a three-layer classifier. The findings
demonstrate that the effectiveness of PCA for multi-label multispectral image
classification depends strongly on the chosen deep learning architecture and
training strategy, opening avenues for future research into self-supervised
pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction approaches.

Motivation: 岩石粒度精确分类在地质工程、矿业和资源管理中具有重要意义，直接影响操作效率和安全性，需要更准确的分类方法

Method: 在ConvNeXt基础上构建CNSCA模型，结合自注意力机制捕获长距离空间依赖关系，通道注意力机制强调信息丰富的特征通道，形成混合设计

Result: 在岩石粒度分类数据集上评估，与三个强基线模型进行对比，结果显示注意力机制的引入显著提升了模型在细粒度分类任务中的能力

Conclusion: 注意力机制的集成有效提升了深度学习模型在岩石粒度分类任务中的表现，能够同时捕获细粒度局部模式和广泛上下文关系，提高分类准确性和稳健性

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

TL;DR: 一种基于临床元数据导向的两阶段滿散框架，用于改善有限角CT重建质量，通过元数据指导的窗口变据器生成触觉前知并结合物理约束保证数据一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角CT虽然提高了时间分辨率和降低放射役爆，但因投影截断导致严重伪影，需要解决这个痴定问题。

Method: 两阶段滿散框架：第一阶段仅使用元数据条件化的窗口变据器模型从噪声生成粗糕触觉前知；第二阶段结合粗糕前知和元数据精炼高保真图像，每个采样步骤都通过ADMM模块强制物理数据一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实心脏CT数据集上验证，结果显示给入元数据显著提升重建保真度，尤其在严重角度截断条件下。在SSIM、PSNR、nMI和PCC指标上都超过现有无元数据基线方法。

Conclusion: 临床元数据在改善重建质量和效率方面发挥双重作用，不同类型元数据具有补充优势，支持将其集成到未来的元数据导向医学形象框架中。

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

Motivation: 现实世界中的视觉识别数据通常是长尾分布的，这给深度神经网络的训练和部署带来了挑战。传统的信息瓶颈方法在处理长尾数据时效果有限，需要新的方法来学习充分且平衡的特征表示。

Method: 将损失函数重平衡和自蒸馏技术集成到原始信息瓶颈网络中，形成平衡信息瓶颈(BIB)。进一步提出混合多个BIB的结构(MBIB)，让不同的BIB负责整合不同网络层的知识，实现端到端的同时学习表示和分类。

Result: 在CIFAR100-LT、ImageNet-LT和iNaturalist 2018等常用长尾数据集上进行实验，BIB和MBIB都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 提出的BIB和MBIB方法能够有效解决长尾视觉识别问题，从信息论角度同时学习表示和分类，在多个数据集上表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

Motivation: 现有光照控制方法需要大量领域特定数据集训练，限制了基础模型的泛化能力和适用性。需要一种能够利用现有生成模型基础知识的实用方法。

Method: 基于光照关系与自注意力层中token交互相似的洞察，训练轻量级LoRA回归器生成直接辐照度图，使用少量训练图像，通过分类器引导将所需光照融入图像生成过程。

Result: 在多种场景类型上展示了最先进的性能，在质量和控制方面表现优异，相比领先工作具有更好的参数和数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过挖掘基础模型的知识，图像光照控制是可行的，能够实现实用且通用的重光照效果。

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Motivation: 当前基于计算机视觉的空间转录组学分析方法严重受数据丢失问题限制，且依赖单细胞RNA测序参考数据，存在对齐质量依赖、批次效应和继承性数据丢失等缺陷。

Method: 提出LGDiST模型，采用无参考的潜在基因扩散方法，利用之前被认为无信息的上下文基因构建丰富的生物学意义遗传潜在空间，包含邻居条件等关键组件。

Result: 在26个数据集上平均MSE降低18%，在6种最先进方法上基因表达预测性能提升达10%。移除关键组件（上下文基因、ST潜在空间、邻居条件）会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LGDiST完整架构相比其孤立组件能实现显著更好的性能，为空间转录组学数据丢失问题提供了有效的无参考解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion
(SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust
performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth
prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or
constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and
equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and
robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates
key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud
registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction,
demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as
digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super
resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale
architectures under complex conditions. The code and DroneSR dataset will be

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于2D高斯泼溅的图像修复框架，通过将不完整图像编码为连续的2D高斯泼溅系数场，利用可微分栅格化过程重建图像，在保持像素级连贯性的同时确保全局语义一致性。

Conclusion: 2D高斯泼溅为图像修复提供了有效的连续表示框架，结合DINO的全局语义指导，能够同时实现局部连贯性和全局一致性，展现了高斯泼溅技术在2D图像处理领域的广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

Motivation: 现有方法在多主体个性化生成中存在身份混合和属性泄漏问题，主要原因是缺乏对不同主体在共享表示空间中如何交互的充分建模

Method: 提出SemAlign-MS数据集提供细粒度语义对应；使用语义对应注意力损失确保精确的点对点语义对齐；开发多参考解耦损失将不同主体推入正交注意力子空间

Conclusion: MOSAIC通过表示级别的精确语义对齐和特征解耦，为复杂多主体合成应用开辟了新可能性，解决了多主体生成中的核心挑战

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然条件生成已被广泛研究，但无需额外训练即可进行提示引导图像编辑的能力同样重要，因为它支持众多实际应用。

Method: 引入VARIN技术，利用新颖的位置感知Argmax反演(LAI)伪逆函数生成逆Gumbel噪声，实现源图像精确重建和可控编辑。

Result: 大量实验表明VARIN能有效根据指定提示修改源图像，同时显著保留原始背景和结构细节。

Conclusion: VARIN被验证为一种实用的编辑方法，为VAR模型提供了有效的文本到图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Draw-In-Mind (DIM)数据集和模型，通过将设计责任明确分配给理解模块来解决多模态统一模型中图像编辑能力不足的问题，在较小参数规模下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型在文本到图像生成方面表现良好，但在精确图像编辑方面存在困难。作者认为这是由于责任分配不平衡造成的：理解模块仅作为翻译器，而生成模块需要同时承担设计师和画家的角色。

Method: 提出了DIM数据集，包含两个子集：DIM-T2I（1400万长上下文图像-文本对）和DIM-Edit（23.3万GPT-4o生成的思维链想象）。通过两层MLP连接冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-3B和可训练的SANA1.5-1.6B，在DIM数据集上训练得到DIM-4.6B模型。

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit在ImgEdit和GEdit-Bench基准测试中达到SOTA或竞争性性能，超越了UniWorld-V1和Step1X-Edit等更大模型。

Conclusion: 将设计责任明确分配给理解模块能显著提升图像编辑性能，证明了该方法在较小参数规模下实现高效图像编辑的可行性。

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has achieved unprecedented success in various
computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection. However, the black-box
nature and high complexity of deep neural networks pose significant challenges
for interpretability, especially in critical domains such as autonomous
driving, medical imaging, and security systems. Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by providing tools and
methods to make model decisions more transparent, interpretable, and
trust-worthy for humans. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art explain-ability methods specifically applied to object
detection models. The paper be-gins by categorizing existing XAI techniques
based on their underlying mechanisms-perturbation-based, gradient-based,
backpropagation-based, and graph-based methods. Notable methods such as D-RISE,
BODEM, D-CLOSE, and FSOD are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the paper
investigates their applicability to various object detection architectures,
including YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet. Statistical analysis of
publication trends from 2022 to mid-2025 shows an accelerating interest in
explainable object detection, indicating its increasing importance. The study
also explores common datasets and evaluation metrics, and highlights the major
challenges associated with model interpretability. By providing a structured
taxonomy and a critical assessment of existing methods, this review aims to
guide researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable explainability
techniques for object detection applications and to foster the development of
more interpretable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调色板在创意工作流中广泛使用，但用于图像生成时存在显著模糊性和不稳定性，需要一种能够灵活控制调色板遵循度和颜色变化的方法。

Method: 将调色板解释为稀疏直方图，引入直方图熵和调色板到直方图距离两个标量控制参数，采用负直方图机制抑制不需要的色调，并在精心策划的数据集上进行训练以确保颜色空间的广泛泛化。

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter通过创新的直方图解释和控制参数机制，有效解决了调色板条件化的问题，为文本到图像生成提供了更精确的颜色控制能力。

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

Method: 使用量化MobileNet模型部署在树莓派上，实现实时行为状态检测，包含模型量化（减少68%内存）、树莓派优化视觉管道和安全IoT通信三个创新点。

Conclusion: 轻量级优化模型如MobileNet为可扩展、低成本且具有临床可操作性的NICU监测系统提供最可行基础，有助于改善资源受限环境的早产儿护理。

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Motivation: 尽管RMOT系统在语言视觉理解方面取得了进展，但其可靠性和鲁棒性研究不足。本文从设计逻辑角度分析RMOT系统的安全影响，识别其对抗性漏洞。

Method: 提出VEIL对抗攻击框架，通过精心设计的数字和物理扰动来破坏RMOT模型的统一指代匹配机制，特别是在使用FIFO内存的模型中引入持续性错误。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RMOT系统存在严重的安全漏洞，强调了在关键大规模应用中需要安全感知的RMOT设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging

evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够将场景分解为独立对象并利用关系理解环境，现有槽位注意力方法仅基于低级特征分配图像区域，缺乏高级语义信息且无法微调编码器

Method: 提出ContextFusion阶段利用前景和背景的语义信息，通过辅助指标提供额外上下文线索；设计Bootstrap分支将特征适应与重构阶段解耦，使用自助策略训练特征适应机制

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，方法显著提升了多个状态的槽位注意力模型的性能

Conclusion: 方法有效解决了现有槽位注意力模型的两大限制，为对象中心学习领域提供了更灵活和有效的适应机制

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD是一种语义感知的判别式逻辑异常检测方法，通过显式建模对象组成图的分布来检测逻辑异常，在MVTec LOCO基准上达到96.1%的AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面异常检测方法擅长检测结构异常（如凹痕、划痕），但在逻辑异常（如不规则或缺失的物体组件）检测上表现不佳。现有最佳方法依赖聚合预训练特征或手工描述符，丢弃了空间和语义信息。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，包含新提出的组成分支来显式建模对象组成图的分布，学习重要语义关系。同时引入无需手工标签或类别特定信息的组成图提取新流程。

Result: 在标准逻辑异常检测基准MVTec LOCO上显著优于现有最先进方法，达到96.1%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: 通过有效建模组成图分布，SALAD方法在逻辑异常检测方面取得了显著改进，证明了语义感知方法的重要性。

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线和离线多目标跟踪方法之间的割裂问题，满足实际部署场景中灵活的时间需求。在线跟踪器难以处理长期遮挡，离线方法仍依赖启发式拼接。

Method: 使用统一的图神经网络框架处理非重叠子片段，通过新颖的自回归长时跟踪(ALT)层进行融合，子片段大小控制延迟和时间上下文之间的权衡。

Result: 在DanceTrack上AssA提升+2.3，SportsMOT上+9.2，MOT20上+5.0，离线模式下提升更大，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: NOOUGAT成功统一了在线和离线跟踪范式，通过灵活的时序处理能力为实际部署提供了适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene
understanding.

Conclusion: ITD数据集有效地模拟了真实环境中的时间依赖性挑战，为TTA方法的性能评测提供了更加准确的基准。新提出的攻击性内存初始化策略为改善内存基TTA方法的表现提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Conclusion: 使用标签分布的自适应标签校正是提升序数分类模型在噪声数据下鲁棒性和准确性的有效策略

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Motivation: 现有深度学习人群计数方法在复杂人群场景中面临两个主要挑战：区域间密度分布差异大，以及视角变化和姿态差异导致的个体表示不一致，这些限制了模型的计数精度。

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

Conclusion: GSD-Net能有效应对医学图像分割中的标注噪声问题，提高模型在真实噪声环境下的性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-OOD是一个针对遥感图像的开分布检测框架，通过空间特征增强、双提示对齐机制和置信度引导的自训练循环，实现了高效的少样本异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法主要针对自然图像，不适用于遥感图像的数据稀缺、多尺度场景结构和显著分布偏移等挑战，需要专门针对遥感特点的解决方案。

Method: 采用遥感特定的视觉-语言建模，包含三个创新：空间特征增强提升场景判别能力，双提示对齐机制交叉验证场景上下文与细粒度语义的空间-语义一致性，置信度引导的自训练循环动态挖掘伪标签扩展训练数据。

Result: RS-OOD在多个遥感基准测试中持续优于现有方法，能够以最少的标注数据实现高效适配。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了空间-语义集成在遥感OOD检测中的关键价值，为自主监测、灾害响应和环境评估等应用提供了可靠的异常模式识别能力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督策略有效提升预测精度，处理现实世界变异性，弥合sim-to-real域差距，在复杂城市场景中表现优异

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source
imagery. Our contributions include the novel ClassMix++ algorithm, which blends
labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on
real-world datasets like Indian Driving Dataset (IDD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Learn-to-Steer框架，通过从扩散模型的内部表示学习数据驱动的目标函数，而不是手工设计损失函数，来改善文本到图像生成模型的空间关系推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在空间关系推理方面表现不佳，特别是在处理不常见的物体组合时。现有方法通过模型微调或手工设计的损失函数进行测试时优化，但这些方法不够优化。

Method: 提出Learn-to-Steer框架，训练一个轻量级分类器从扩散模型的交叉注意力图中解码空间关系，然后将该分类器作为学习的损失函数在推理时使用。采用双重反转策略来强制几何理解，避免分类器走捷径检测语言痕迹而非真正的空间模式。

Result: 方法显著提高了空间准确性：在FLUX.1-dev上从0.20提升到0.61，在SD2.1上从0.07提升到0.54。该方法还能泛化到多种关系并显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过直接从模型内部表示学习目标函数，而不是手工设计，可以显著改善扩散模型的空间推理能力，该方法具有很好的泛化性和效果提升。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

Motivation: 当前人工智能模型评估缺乏对人类特征挑战性任务的测试，需要通过棋盔游戏等新方式来更全面评估模型的人类化程度

Method: 使用棋盔游戏Hues & Cues测试CLIP模型的颜色感知和命名能力，分析其与人类观察者的对齐程度

Result: CLIP模型在颜色感知方面整体与人类良好对齐，但曝露出文化偏见和不同抽象层次处理不一致的问题，这些问题在常规测试中难以发现

Conclusion: 通过棋盔游戏等多样化任务评估模型，可以更有效地发现模型的潜在缺陷，进一步提升模型人类化评估的全面性

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniActor通用智能体，通过分层异构MoE架构解决GUI和具身数据在浅层协同与深层冲突的问题，统一动作空间并整合多源数据训练，在GUI和具身任务中均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体研究主要专注于GUI或具身场景，但复杂任务需要智能体交替与2D虚拟世界和3D真实世界交互。混合训练时发现GUI和具身数据存在冲突导致性能下降，需要解决这种数据冲突问题。

Method: 提出分层异构MoE架构：浅层参数共享以利用协同效应，深层参数分离以消除冲突。统一GUI和具身任务的动作空间，并从多源收集大规模数据进行训练。

Result: OmniActor在GUI和具身任务中均优于仅使用单一数据训练的智能体，特别是在GUI任务中表现显著提升，成功实现了协同效应的利用和冲突的消除。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人脑大脑-小脑机制的分层设计，成功解决了多模态智能体在跨环境交互时的数据冲突问题，为构建通用智能体提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Conclusion: C33D方法为3D对象合成提供了一种简单但强大的解决方案，能够生成结构一致的新题材3D模型

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面的局限性，提出了MulSeT基准测试，发现仅增加训练数据无法有效提升空间理解能力，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在空间理解方面仍存在困难，但缺乏全面系统的评估。本文旨在从数据和架构两个角度系统分析空间理解能力。

Method: 提出了MulSeT基准测试，涵盖单视图、多视图和视频三种代表性场景，设计了一系列实验来分析MLLMs的空间推理能力。

Result: 从数据角度看，空间理解性能随训练数据增加快速收敛，上限较低；从架构角度看，空间理解更依赖于视觉编码器中的位置编码而非语言模型中的位置编码。

Conclusion: 仅扩展训练数据不足以实现满意的空间理解性能，需要通过架构设计和推理注入来优化空间理解能力，为改进空间推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在医学图像分割中缺乏跨模态和跨机构的泛化能力，视觉基础模型虽然强大但存在ViT主干网络性能不足和自然图像与医学图像领域差距大的挑战

Method: 重新设计简单有效的多尺度token聚合架构，在CT-3M数据集（387万张CT切片）上进行多阶段DINOv3领域自适应预训练，学习鲁棒的密集特征

Result: MedDINOv3在四个分割基准测试中达到或超越了最先进性能

Conclusion: 该研究证明了视觉基础模型作为医学图像分割统一骨干网络的潜力

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,
we present a deployment-friendly 4D cost aggregation network DBStereo, which is
based on pure 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first provide a thorough
analysis of the decoupling characteristics of 4D cost volume. And design a
lightweight bidirectional geometry aggregation block to capture spatial and
disparity representation respectively. Through decoupled learning, our approach
achieves real-time performance and impressive accuracy simultaneously.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DBStereo outperforms all
existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even
surpassing the iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo. Our study break the
empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 现有美妆转移方法存在身份偏移、公平性问题，且缺乏实时能力和时间一致性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将美妆转移解耦为两步：透明化妆面具提取和图形学面具渲染。使用图形渲染流水线和无监督k-means聚类生成假偏真实数据训练模型，采用专门的训练目标如alpha权重重建和唇彩损失。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了实时虚拟化妆试用中的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

TL;DR: TeRA是一个高效的两阶段文本到3D头像生成框架，通过结构化潜在空间和潜在扩散模型替代传统SDS方法，实现快速生成和局部定制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SDS-based模型和大型3D生成模型在文本到3D头像生成中存在效率低下和优化缓慢的问题，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）从大型人体重建模型中蒸馏解码器构建结构化潜在空间；2）训练文本控制的潜在扩散模型在该空间内生成逼真3D头像

Result: 在主观和客观评估中均优于之前的文本到3D头像生成模型，消除了缓慢的迭代优化过程

Conclusion: TeRA框架通过结构化潜在表示和潜在扩散模型，为文本到3D头像生成提供了更高效有效的解决方案，支持基于文本的局部定制

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

### [429] [Anisotropic Fourier Features for Positional Encoding in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02488)
*Nabil Jabareen,Dongsheng Yuan,Dingming Liu,Foo-Wei Ten,Sören Lukassen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对医学影像各向异性特点的Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE)方法，在多个医学影像任务中显著优于现有位置编码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中复杂器官形状和各向异性的高维图像特性使得传统位置编码方法（如正弦位置编码和各向同性傅里叶特征位置编码）在处理医学图像时表现不佳，需要专门针对医学影像各向异性特点的位置编码方法。

Method: 提出了Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE)，这是对各向同性傅里叶特征位置编码的泛化，能够整合各向异性、类别特定和领域特定的空间依赖性。

Result: 在胸部X光多标签分类、CT器官分类和超声心动图射血分数回归等任务中，AFPE在所有测试的各向异性设置中都显著优于最先进的位置编码方法，正确选择位置编码可以显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 在各向异性的医学图像和视频中，选择适合数据和目标形状的各向异性位置编码至关重要，AFPE为此类任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

Conclusion: 该方法为健身活动识别提供了可扩展和实时可行的解决方案，在基于视觉的健康监测领域具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

*Guyue Hu,Siyuan Song,Jingpeng Sun,Zhe Jin,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合模态联邦学习框架MDM-MixMFL，用于解决分布式医院中MRI图像分割的模态异构性问题，通过模态解耦和记忆机制实现稳定聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI图像分割方法主要采用集中式多模态范式，不适用于工程中非集中式混合模态医疗场景。分布式医院处理多种混合MRI模态，存在严重的客户端模态异构性和数据异构性问题。

Method: 提出MDM-MixMFL框架，包含模态解耦策略和模态记忆机制。模态解耦将每个模态分解为模态特定和模态共享信息，在联邦更新时分别进行定制化和共享更新。模态记忆机制动态存储客户端共享模态原型。

Result: 在两个公共MRI图像分割数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决混合模态联邦学习中的模态异构性问题，为分布式医疗场景中的MRI图像分割提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR是一个完全无监督的多目标发现方法，通过运动分割和自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR的扩展，无需人工监督即可检测和定位视觉场景中的不同对象实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督多目标发现方法虽然利用目标中心学习和视频运动线索，但仍需要监督生成伪标签来训练模型。本文旨在解决这一限制，开发一个真正完全无监督的方法。

Method: 扩展自监督预训练模型DINOSAUR，通过检索无相机运动的视频帧进行无监督光流运动分割，生成高质量伪标签，然后使用这些标签精炼DINOSAUR的槽表示，并训练槽停用模块来分配前景和背景槽。

Result: 在TRI-PD和KITTI数据集上实现了强大的多目标发现结果，优于之前的state-of-the-art方法，尽管是完全无监督的。

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR通过其概念简洁性证明了完全无监督多目标发现的可行性，为无监督计算机视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

TL;DR: 通过分析VGGT模型的性能瓶颈和关注地图出现的token凑契现象，这项工作探索了在3D视觉模型中应用token合并技术的潜力。研究人员提出FastVGGT，采用一种无需训练的机制来加速VGGT，通过专门为3D结构和任务设计的token分区策略，在保持重建能力的同时消除冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D视觉基础模型的发展，将这些模型扩展到长序列图像输入面临着推理时间效率低下的挑战。VGGT作为最先进的前向传播视觉几何模型，在处理长序列输入时出现了性能瓶颈和token凑契现象，需要找到提高效率的解决方案。

Method: 研究人员提出FastVGGT，首次在3D领域利用token合并技术。该方法采用一种无需训练的机制，为3D架构和任务设计了独特的token分区策略，有效消除冗余计算同时保持VGGT的强大重建能力。

Result: 在多个3D几何测试集上进行了广泛实验，验证了该方法的有效性。在1000张输入图像的情况下，FastVGGT实现了较VGGT提速4倍，同时减轻了长序列场景中的错误累积问题。

Conclusion: 这些发现呈现了token合并作为可扩展3D视觉系统的原理性解决方案的潜力，为处理长序列图像输入提供了高效的加速方法。

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的查询类型T-GNN（旅程基于组最近邻查询），用于在用户现有旅程中寻找最优聚会点，最小化总体旅程超出距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人生活很忙碌，组织聚会时常常需要在现有旅程中安排，如送孩子、上班、购物等活动中找机会聚会。

Method: 提出T-GNN查询模型，允许用户在旅程任意位置缓行到聚会点，并提出三种剪枝技术来精简搜索空间，提高查询效率。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法的性能，能够高效处理实时T-GNN查询。

Conclusion: T-GNN查询为组织聚会提供了一种高效的解决方案，能够在用户现有旅程基础上最小化旅行费用。

Abstract: In recent years, organizing group meetups for entertainment or other
necessities has gained significant importance, especially given the busy nature
of daily schedules. People often combine multiple activities, such as dropping
kids off at school, commuting to work, and grocery shopping, while seeking
opportunities to meet others. To address this need, we propose a novel query
type, the Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN) query, which identifies the
optimal meetup Point of Interest (POI) that aligns with users' existing trips.
An individual trip consists of a sequence of locations, allowing users the
flexibility to detour to the meetup POI at any location within the sequence,
known as a detour location. Given a set of trips for the users, the query
identifies the optimal meetup POI (e.g., restaurants or movie theaters) and
detour locations from each user's trip that minimize the total trip overhead
distance. The trip overhead distance refers to the additional distance a user
must travel to visit the meetup POI before returning to the next location in
their trip. The sum of these overhead distances for all users constitutes the
total trip overhead distance. The computation time for processing T-GNN queries
increases with the number of POIs. To address this, we introduce three
techniques to prune the POIs that cannot contribute to the optimal solution,
and thus refine the search space. We also develop an efficient approach for
processing T-GNN queries in real-time. Extensive experiments validate the
performance of the proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义数据处理系统缺乏统一的代数基础，导致查询难以组合、推理和优化，需要建立标准化的语义代数框架。

Method: 提出基于扩展关系代数的SABER语义代数，实现语义操作的逻辑计划构造和优化，并以SQL兼容语法实现，支持混合数据处理。

Result: SABER能够为现有语义数据处理系统提供统一接口，有效混合匹配不同系统的语义兼容算子实现，增强社区贡献的适用性。

Conclusion: SABER语义代数填补了语义数据处理系统代数基础的空白，为语义查询的组合、优化和形式化验证提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of large-language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of
semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against
unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified
algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and
optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on
Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations'
logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We
further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it
natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we
showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so
that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator
implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for
community contributions.

Motivation: 现有数据差异比较工具在处理模式漂移、异构类型和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足数据工程工作流对可靠差异比较的需求。

Method: 结合模式感知映射、类型特定比较器和并行执行，采用LLM辅助的标注管道生成确定性、模式有效的多标签解释，使用检索增强和约束解码技术。

Conclusion: SmartDiff在迁移验证、回归测试、合规审计和持续数据质量监控等方面具有重要应用价值，显著提升了数据差异比较的效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Data engineering workflows require reliable differencing across files,
databases, and query outputs, yet existing tools falter under schema drift,
heterogeneous types, and limited explainability. SmartDiff is a unified system
that combines schema-aware mapping, type-specific comparators, and parallel
execution. It aligns evolving schemas, compares structured and semi-structured
data (strings, numbers, dates, JSON/XML), and clusters results with labels that
explain how and why differences occur. On multi-million-row datasets, SmartDiff
achieves over 95 percent precision and recall, runs 30 to 40 percent faster,
and uses 30 to 50 percent less memory than baselines; in user studies, it
reduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes. An LLM-assisted
labeling pipeline produces deterministic, schema-valid multilabel explanations
using retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding; ablations show further
gains in label accuracy and time to diagnosis over rules-only baselines. These
results indicate SmartDiff's utility for migration validation, regression
testing, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring. Index

Method: 提出了统一的评估框架，引入了三种新设计：1）基于一致性的批处理大小确定策略；2）用于成对排序的多数投票机制；3）适配LLM的双向外部归并排序算法。

Result: 实验表明：基于一致性的方法能有效确定批处理大小，多数投票机制在GPT-4o上显著增强成对比较效果，外部归并排序在准确性和效率之间达到良好平衡。发现了计算成本与排序质量之间的对数线性缩放关系。

Conclusion: 首次为LLM驱动的数据系统提供了原则性成本模型的基础，证明了不同排序方法的效果取决于具体查询和数据特性，没有单一最优解决方案。

Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its
physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments
show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness
depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an
agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise
sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive
experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch
size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently
strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves
high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further
observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality,
offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data
systems.

Conclusion: CRouting是有效的图基ANNS加速方案，通过智能路由策略显著减少计算开销，代码已开源

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a crucial problem in
information retrieval and AI applications. Recently, there has been a surge of
interest in graph-based ANNS algorithms due to their superior efficiency and
accuracy. However, the repeated computation of distances in high-dimensional
spaces constitutes the primary time cost of graph-based methods. To accelerate
the search, we propose a novel routing strategy named CRouting, which bypasses
unnecessary distance computations by exploiting the angle distributions of
high-dimensional vectors. CRouting is designed as a plugin to optimize existing
graph-based search with minimal code modifications. Our experiments show that
CRouting reduces the number of distance computations by up to 41.5% and boosts
queries per second by up to 1.48$\times$ on two predominant graph indexes, HNSW
and NSG. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ISCS-ZJU/CRouting.

Motivation: 区块链混合存储解决方案依赖中心化存储服务提供商(SPs)，虽然使用认证数据结构(ADS)确保数据完整性，但无法防止SPs遗漏有效查询结果，存在查询正确性隐患。

Method: 提出BPI框架，采用专门为区块链环境设计的"关节式搜索"查询模式，结合一套验证模型来确保搜索结果包含所有有效内容，同时保持低开销。

Result: 实验评估显示BPI框架在区块链关键词搜索中表现出卓越的可扩展性和性能，超越了EthMB+和主流混合存储区块链中常用的最先进搜索数据库。

Conclusion: BPI框架有效解决了区块链混合存储中的查询正确性问题，通过创新的搜索模式和验证机制实现了高效、低成本的关键词查询和维护。

Abstract: Hybrid storage solutions have emerged as potent strategies to alleviate the
data storage bottlenecks prevalent in blockchain systems. These solutions
harness off-chain Storage Services Providers (SPs) in conjunction with
Authenticated Data Structures (ADS) to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Despite these advancements, the reliance on centralized SPs raises concerns
about query correctness. Although ADS can verify the existence of individual
query results, they fall short of preventing SPs from omitting valid results.
  In this paper, we delineate the fundamental distinctions between data search
in blockchains and traditional database systems. Drawing upon these insights,
we introduce BPI, a lightweight framework that enables efficient keyword
queries and maintenance with low overhead. We propose "Articulated Search", a
query pattern specifically designed for blockchain environments that enhances
search efficiency while significantly reducing costs during data user updates.
Furthermore, BPI employs a suite of validation models to ensure the inclusion
of all valid content in search results while maintaining low overhead.
  Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BPI framework
achieves outstanding scalability and performance in keyword searches within
blockchain, surpassing EthMB+ and state of the art search databases commonly
used in mainstream hybrid storage blockchains (HSB).

TL;DR: MONO是一种基于一致性加权采样的近重复文本对齐方法，支持加权Jaccard相似度，在索引构建时间、索引大小和查询延迟方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法缺乏准确性保证且需要大量难以调优的参数，现有min-hash方法无法考虑词元重要性或频率，限制了在真实场景中的应用

Method: 采用一致性加权采样技术，支持加权Jaccard相似度，通过将子序列按其min-hash分组，为每个查询找到与其草图相似的所有草图

Result: MONO在索引构建时间上比现有技术快26倍，索引大小减少30%，查询延迟提高3倍，且具有良好的扩展性

Conclusion: MONO在哈希框架内达到最优性，为加权文本相似性搜索提供了高效且理论保证的解决方案

Abstract: Near-duplicate text alignment is the task of identifying, among the texts in
a corpus, all the subsequences (substrings) that are similar to a given query.
Traditional approaches rely on seeding-extension-filtering heuristics, which
lack accuracy guarantees and require many hard-to-tune parameters. Recent
methods leverage min-hash techniques under a hash-based framework: group
subsequences by their min-hash, and for any query, find all sketches similar to
the query's sketch. These methods guarantee to report all subsequences whose
estimated unweighted Jaccard similarity with the query exceeds a user-provided
threshold and are efficient. However, they fail to account for token importance
or frequency, which limits their use in real scenarios where tokens carry
weights, such as TF-IDF. To address this, we propose MONO, an approach that
supports weighted Jaccard similarity using consistent weighted sampling. MONO
achieves optimality within the hash-based framework. For example, when token
weights are proportional to frequencies, MONO generates O(n + n log f) groups
in expectation for a text of length n, where f is the maximum token frequency.
Each group takes O(1) space and represents a few subsequences sharing the same
sampling. We prove this bound is tight: any algorithm must produce Omega(n + n
log f) groups in expectation in the worst case. Experiments show that MONO
outperforms the state of the art by up to 26x in index construction time,
reduces index size by up to 30 percent, and improves query latency by up to 3x,
while scaling well.

*Aamod Khatiwada,Roee Shraga,Renée J. Miller*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了DUST算法，解决数据湖中联合表搜索时结果多样性不足的问题，通过聚类和新型嵌入模型实现高效多样的元组发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联合表搜索方法找到的表往往与查询表高度相似，缺乏新信息，需要寻找既联合又多样的元组来丰富查询结果。

Method: 提出基于聚类的元组多样性算法DUST，使用新型嵌入模型表示可联合元组，通过聚类技术实现高效多样性选择。

Result: DUST的嵌入模型比其他模型性能提升至少15%，算法效率比最有效的基线快6倍以上，在多样化方面表现更优。

Conclusion: DUST算法有效解决了数据湖中联合表搜索的多样性问题，在效率和效果上都显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Unionable table search techniques input a query table from a user and search
for data lake tables that can contribute additional rows to the query table.
The definition of unionability is generally based on similarity measures which
may include similarity between columns (e.g., value overlap or semantic
similarity of the values in the columns) or tables (e.g., similarity of table
embeddings). Due to this and the large redundancy in many data lakes (which can
contain many copies and versions of the same table), the most unionable tables
may be identical or nearly identical to the query table and may contain little
new information. Hence, we introduce the problem of identifying unionable
tuples from a data lake that are diverse with respect to the tuples already
present in a query table. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of
well-known diversity algorithms applied to this novel problem and identify a
gap that we address with a novel, clustering-based tuple diversity algorithm
called DUST. DUST uses a novel embedding model to represent unionable tuples
that outperforms other tuple representation models by at least 15 % when
representing unionable tuples. Using real data lake benchmarks, we show that
our diversification algorithm is more than six times faster than the most
efficient diversification baseline. We also show that it is more effective in
diversifying unionable tuples than existing diversification algorithms.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文批判了计算机科学概念建模中过度关注概念模式而忽视信息库的"模式转向"现象，提出了包含模式和基底的包容性建模方法，并展示了bCLEARer等新技术如何实现更自动化的建模实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流概念建模实践过度偏向概念模式而完全忽视信息库，这种"模式转向"限制了建模的可能性。作者旨在揭示这种偏向的历史成因，证明其并非根本性约束，并展示现代技术如何支持更包容的建模方法。

Method: 通过历史分析追溯"模式转向"的起源，使用理论论证说明其非根本性，并以bCLEARer为例展示基于管道的概念建模技术如何实现模式与基底的整合。

Result: 研究表明概念建模实践的空间比当前假设的更广阔，现代技术确实支持包容性建模方法，能够实现更自动化和经验驱动的实践。

Conclusion: "模式转向"对信息库的完全排斥可能只是一个暂时的进化弯路，未来概念建模将朝着整合模式和基底的方向发展，需要新的管道式建模技术支持。

Abstract: If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual
modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema
completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is
often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are
crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost
universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this
paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual
modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is
not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an
inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables
more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more
generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than
currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the
implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new
pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the
schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a
temporary evolutionary detour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算使能对象存储系统存在输出格式限制、操作符支持有限和缺乏深度存储层次优化等根本性限制，阻碍了其在复杂分析任务中的有效性

Method: 提出OASIS系统，具有：1）通过多种格式（包括Arrow列式布局）实现灵活可互操作的输出交付；2）广泛支持复杂操作符和数组感知表达式；3）基于操作符特性和数据移动成本的动态最优执行路径选择

Result: 在Spark分析框架中集成OASIS原型，使用真实科学查询进行评估，相比配置现有COS系统的Spark实现32.7%的性能提升

Conclusion: OASIS通过解决现有COS系统的三大限制，为HPC环境中的大规模数据集后分析提供了更有效的存储解决方案

Abstract: Computation-Enabled Object Storage (COS) systems, such as MinIO and Ceph,
have recently emerged as promising storage solutions for post hoc, SQL-based
analysis on large-scale datasets in High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments. By supporting object-granular layouts, COS facilitates
column-oriented access and supports in-storage execution of data reduction
operators, such as filters, close to where the data resides. Despite growing
interest and adoption, existing COS systems exhibit several fundamental
limitations that hinder their effectiveness. First, they impose rigid
constraints on output data formats, limiting flexibility and interoperability.
Second, they support offloading for only a narrow set of operators and
expressions, restricting their applicability to more complex analytical tasks.
Third--and perhaps most critically--they fail to incorporate design strategies
that enable compute offloading optimized for the characteristics of deep
storage hierarchies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OASIS, a
novel COS system that features: (i) flexible and interoperable output delivery
through diverse formats, including columnar layouts such as Arrow; (ii) broad
support for complex operators (e.g., aggregate, sort) and array-aware
expressions, including element-wise predicates over array structures; and (iii)
dynamic selection of optimal execution paths across internal storage layers,
guided by operator characteristics and data movement costs. We implemented a
prototype of OASIS and integrated it into the Spark analytics framework.
Through extensive evaluation using real-world scientific queries from HPC
workflows, OASIS achieves up to a 32.7% performance improvement over Spark
configured with existing COS-based storage systems.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GeoLayer是一个地理分布式图存储框架，通过分层图架构、重叠感知的副本放置和分层路由策略，优化图数据副本放置和模式请求路由，显著提升响应时间和分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据的固有连通性和依赖性，以及其独特的拓扑驱动访问模式，对传统地理分布式云存储系统中的数据复制和请求路由策略提出了根本性挑战。

Method: 1) 构建延迟感知的分层图架构，分解图拓扑以减少优化问题的决策空间和计算复杂度；2) 引入重叠感知的副本放置方案，适应图模式访问的多样性；3) 使用定向热扩散模型指导数据分配；4) 开发逐步分层路由策略，在分层图上进行渐进式扩展以高效检索数据。

Result: 与最先进的副本放置和路由方案相比，GeoLayer在线图模式请求的响应时间提高了1.34倍至3.67倍，离线图分析性能加速了1.28倍至3.56倍。

Conclusion: GeoLayer通过联合优化图副本放置和模式请求路由，有效解决了地理分布式环境中图数据存储和访问的挑战，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: The inherent connectivity and dependency of graph-structured data, combined
with its unique topology-driven access patterns, pose fundamental challenges to
conventional data replication and request routing strategies in geo-distributed
cloud storage systems. In this paper, we propose GeoLayer, a geo-distributed
graph storage framework that jointly optimizes graph replica placement and
pattern request routing. We first construct a latency-aware layered graph
architecture that decomposes the graph topology into multiple layers, aiming to
reduce the decision space and computational complexity of the optimization
problem, while mitigating the impact of network heterogeneity in
geo-distributed environments. Building on the layered graph, we introduce an
overlap-centric replica placement scheme to accommodate the diversity of graph
pattern accesses, along with a directed heat diffusion model that captures heat
conduction and superposition effects to guide data allocation. For request
routing, we develop a stepwise layered routing strategy that performs
progressive expansion over the layered graph to efficiently retrieve the
required data. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art
replica placement and routing schemes, GeoLayer achieves a 1.34x - 3.67x
improvement in response times for online graph pattern requests and a 1.28x -
3.56x speedup in offline graph analysis performance.

TL;DR: Halo是一个针对多智能体LLM工作流的批处理优化系统，通过查询计划DAG表示和共享计算优化，显著提升GPU利用率和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务引擎只优化单个调用，多智能体框架缺乏系统级性能规划，导致重复提示、上下文重叠和并发执行造成大量冗余和GPU利用率低下

Method: 将工作流表示为结构化查询计划DAG，构建批处理查询的合并图以暴露共享计算，基于考虑预填充和解码成本、缓存重用和GPU放置的成本模型进行计划级优化

Result: 在六个基准测试中，Halo实现了批量推理最高18.6倍加速和在线服务4.7倍吞吐量提升，支持数万个查询和复杂图的工作负载，且不损害输出质量

Conclusion: 通过统一查询优化和LLM服务，Halo能够在数据分析和决策应用中实现高效的智能体工作流

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows combine multi-step
reasoning, tool use, and collaboration across multiple specialized agents.
Existing LLM serving engines optimize indi- vidual calls in isolation, while
multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance
planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and concurrent
ex- ecutions create substantial redundancy and poor GPU utilization, especially
in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch
query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents
each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consoli- dated
graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost
model that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU
placement, Halo performs plan-level op- timization to minimize redundant
execution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and
migration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware
efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to
18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput im- provement under
online serving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and
complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality.
By unifying query optimiza- tion with LLM serving, Halo enables efficient
agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

Motivation: 数据代理领域缺乏全面的基准测试，现有测试用例构建成本高、复杂度大，且适应性和泛化能力有限，无法有效评估多源数据分析任务中的代理性能。

Method: 构建包含2007个多样化任务的标准化基准测试，设计代理-专家协作框架确保异构数据上的可靠高效构建，并配备强大的跨系统泛化能力。

Conclusion: FDABench填补了数据代理基准测试的空白，为全面评估多源数据分析场景中的代理性能提供了可靠工具，揭示了不同系统的性能特点。

Abstract: The growing demand for data-driven decision-making has created an urgent need
for data agents that can integrate structured and unstructured data for
analysis. While data agents show promise for enabling users to perform complex
analytics tasks, this field still suffers from three critical limitations:
first, comprehensive data agent benchmarks remain absent due to the difficulty
of designing test cases that evaluate agents' abilities across multi-source
analytical tasks; second, constructing reliable test cases that combine
structured and unstructured data remains costly and prohibitively complex;
third, existing benchmarks exhibit limited adaptability and generalizability,
resulting in narrow evaluation scope.
  To address these challenges, we present FDABench, the first data agent
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating agents in multi-source data
analytical scenarios. Our contributions include: (i) we construct a
standardized benchmark with 2,007 diverse tasks across different data sources,
domains, difficulty levels, and task types to comprehensively evaluate data
agent performance; (ii) we design an agent-expert collaboration framework
ensuring reliable and efficient benchmark construction over heterogeneous data;
(iii) we equip FDABench with robust generalization capabilities across diverse
target systems and frameworks. We use FDABench to evaluate various data agent
systems, revealing that each system exhibits distinct advantages and
limitations regarding response quality, accuracy, latency, and token cost.

TL;DR: KVComp是一个高效的KV缓存管理框架，通过专门设计的无损压缩技术显著减少长文本生成中的内存需求，同时保持模型精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型在长上下文推理时面临KV缓存内存需求巨大的挑战，可能达到GB级别，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用新颖的针对KV缓存数据特性的有损压缩技术，结合压缩算法和系统架构的协同设计，保持与KV缓存增长特性的兼容性。

Result: 平均实现47%的内存减少率，最高可达83%，几乎没有模型精度损失，执行吞吐量极高，在某些情况下甚至加速矩阵向量乘法操作。

Conclusion: KVComp提供了一个通用高效的解决方案，显著降低长文本生成的内存需求，同时保持高性能和模型精度。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive
potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference
poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the
key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length
and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and
efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that
synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical
inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques
specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful
co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach
maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving
high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves
on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to
existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp
achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing
decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector
multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with
less data movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然视觉质量出色，但计算成本高昂，现有服务系统采用固定级联配置，对所有查询都经过轻量级阶段，浪费了复杂查询的资源。

Method: HADIS使用基于规则的提示路由器将困难查询直接路由到重量级模型，通过离线分析生成帕累托最优级联配置表，运行时根据延迟和工作负载约束选择最佳配置和GPU分配。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹上的实证评估显示，HADIS将响应质量提升高达35%，同时将延迟违规率降低2.7-45倍。

Conclusion: HADIS通过自适应查询路由和资源配置优化，有效解决了扩散模型服务的高成本和延迟问题，实现了质量与效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality but
incur high computational costs, making real-time, scalable deployment
challenging. Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by
cascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade
configuration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage,
wasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive
diffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection,
query routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt
router to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing
the overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource
management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal
cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade
configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints.
Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves
response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by
2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.

Conclusion: AI驱动的并行化方法能够有效利用SMT技术提升延迟关键应用的性能，证明了AI在代码优化领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional
units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative
execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to
significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading
(SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical
applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to
support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications.
Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we
extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through
Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization.
Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of
dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance
simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel
framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize
latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in
industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of
latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

Motivation: 传统推测解码使用固定推测长度，在批量服务环境中面对多样化请求时表现不佳，需要动态适应机制

Method: DSDE框架包含两个核心组件：基于KL散度方差的预测信号诊断生成稳定性，以及自适应推测长度上限解决序列解码中的滞后问题

Result: 实验表明基于KL散度的稳定性信号有效，算法在端到端延迟上与领先基线竞争，在多样化工作负载下表现出优越鲁棒性，特别在低接受率场景中保持诊断效用

Conclusion: 事后信号是构建更鲁棒智能LLM推理系统的重要组件，为动态推测长度适应研究指明了有前景的方向

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its
reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving
environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for
dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic
signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free
framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the
variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the
generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to
mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments
demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic
adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency
competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across
diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging
low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic
utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable
component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and
highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation
length adaptation.

Motivation: 传统BFT共识协议依赖指定领导者提议交易，存在性能瓶颈。需要开发一个无领导者的并行共识协议，在保持拜占庭容错的同时实现最优性能指标。

Method: 采用并行共识实例处理交易，引入新型非交互式阈值签名方案OciorBLSts，支持快速签名聚合和即时聚合特性，实现无领导者设计和稳定活性保证。

Result: 协议达到：1)最优容错性：容忍t个故障节点(n≥3t+1)；2)最优通信复杂度：每交易O(n)；3)最优计算复杂度：最好情况O(n)，最坏情况O(n log² n)；4)最优轮次复杂度：2轮异步回合完成交易最终确认。

Conclusion: Ocior是第一个在异步环境下实现所有四个最优性能指标的BFT共识协议，通过无领导者设计和创新的阈值签名技术，为拜占庭容错共识提供了实用的高性能解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose Ocior, a practical asynchronous Byzantine
fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol that achieves the optimal performance
in resilience, communication, computation, and round complexity. Unlike
traditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions
individually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While
leader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose
transactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable
liveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$
faulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal
communication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is
$O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total
computation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \log^2 n)$ in
the worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction
can be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any
$n\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where
the transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A
two-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or
group of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we
introduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called
OciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure.
OciorBLSts achieves a signature aggregation computation cost of only $O(n)$ for
the best case. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of Instantaneous TS
Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial signatures as they
arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，用于在TON区块链上去中心化交易所早期检测rug pull骗局，比较了两种rug pull定义方法，在交易前5分钟内实现了有效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TON区块链独特的异步架构和Telegram带来的海量web2用户基础为欺诈分析提供了新颖且关键的环境，需要保护投资者并增强TON DeFi生态系统的安全基础设施。

Method: 在TON两大DEX平台Ston.Fi和DeDust上融合数据训练模型，比较了TVL-based（流动性突然撤出）和idle-based（交易活动突然停止）两种rug pull定义方法，使用梯度提升模型进行检测。

Result: 梯度提升模型能在交易前5分钟内有效识别rug pull，TVL-based方法AUC最高达0.891，idle-based方法在召回率方面表现优异。特征集在各交易所间一致但分布差异显著。

Conclusion: 该研究为投资者提供了关键的早期预警机制，强调了需要开发针对不同平台的鲁棒模型，以应对数据融合的挑战并增强TON DeFi生态系统的安全性。

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning framework for the early detection of
rug pull scams on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within The Open Network (TON)
blockchain. TON's unique architecture, characterized by asynchronous execution
and a massive web2 user base from Telegram, presents a novel and critical
environment for fraud analysis. We conduct a comprehensive study on the two
largest TON DEXs, Ston.Fi and DeDust, fusing data from both platforms to train
our models. A key contribution is the implementation and comparative analysis
of two distinct rug pull definitions--TVL-based (a catastrophic liquidity
withdrawal) and idle-based (a sudden cessation of all trading activity)--within
a single, unified study. We demonstrate that Gradient Boosting models can
effectively identify rug pulls within the first five minutes of trading, with
the TVL-based method achieving superior AUC (up to 0.891) while the idle-based
method excels at recall. Our analysis reveals that while feature sets are
consistent across exchanges, their underlying distributions differ
significantly, challenging straightforward data fusion and highlighting the
need for robust, platform-aware models. This work provides a crucial
early-warning mechanism for investors and enhances the security infrastructure
of the rapidly growing TON DeFi ecosystem.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LobRA是一个针对多任务LoRA微调的新框架，通过处理序列长度变化和偏斜的异构性问题，显著提升联合微调效率，减少45.03%-60.67%的GPU时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer预训练模型的突破，微调需求不断增长，服务提供商需要降低处理微调请求的成本。虽然LoRA技术允许多任务联合训练，但训练数据中的序列长度变化和偏斜问题会降低效率。

Method: LobRA框架采用两种创新设计：1) 部署具有异构资源使用和并行配置的微调副本，匹配序列长度变化带来的不同工作负载；2) 在每个训练步骤中，考虑序列长度偏斜，在异构微调副本间分发训练数据以实现工作负载平衡。

Result: 实验验证LobRA显著减少了联合微调所需的GPU时间，降幅达到45.03%-60.67%。

Conclusion: LobRA通过有效处理训练数据异构性问题，成功提升了多任务LoRA联合微调的效率，为服务提供商提供了成本效益更高的微调解决方案。

Abstract: With the breakthrough of Transformer-based pre-trained models, the demand for
fine-tuning (FT) to adapt the base pre-trained models to downstream
applications continues to grow, so it is essential for service providers to
reduce the cost of processing FT requests. Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely
used FT technique that only trains small-scale adapters and keeps the base
model unaltered, conveying the possibility of processing multiple FT tasks by
jointly training different LoRA adapters with a shared base model.
  Nevertheless, through in-depth analysis, we reveal the efficiency of joint FT
is dampened by two heterogeneity issues in the training data -- the sequence
length variation and skewness. To tackle these issues, we develop LobRA, a
brand new framework that supports processing multiple FT tasks by jointly
training LoRA adapters. Two innovative designs are introduced. Firstly, LobRA
deploys the FT replicas (i.e., model replicas for FT) with heterogeneous
resource usages and parallel configurations, matching the diverse workloads
caused by the sequence length variation. Secondly, for each training step,
LobRA takes account of the sequence length skewness and dispatches the training
data among the heterogeneous FT replicas to achieve workload balance. We
conduct experiments to assess the performance of LobRA, validating that it
significantly reduces the GPU seconds required for joint FT by 45.03%-60.67%.

TL;DR: LiquidGEMM是一个硬件高效的W4A8 GEMM内核，通过LiquidQuant量化方法和隐式细粒度流水线技术，实现了比现有方案最高2.9倍的加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的W4A8 GEMM内核在实践中效率不足，因为CUDA核心上的反量化操作无法跟上Tensor核心的高吞吐量，限制了LLM推理的加速效果

Method: 设计了LiquidQuant硬件高效量化方法（每4个元素仅需两条算术指令实现快速、溢出安全的反量化）和隐式细粒度流水线技术（在warp组间完全重叠权重加载、反量化和矩阵乘法运算）

Result: 实验结果显示LiquidGEMM比最先进的W4A8内核快达2.90倍，端到端系统级加速达4.94倍；相比NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM中的各种量化GEMM内核，性能提升1.12-1.63倍

Conclusion: LiquidGEMM通过创新的量化方法和流水线设计，有效解决了W4A8量化在实践中的性能瓶颈，为高效LLM服务提供了硬件高效的解决方案

Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by
reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various
schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong
balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels
fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which
cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we
present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM
serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a
hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe
dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an
implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading,
dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or
redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up
to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end
system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA
TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up
to 1.63x system-level speedup.

Motivation: 为了解决分布式异构系统在不同硬件平台上需要大量重构的问题，提供一个能够适应当前和未来系统、支持各种并行编程范式的统一抽象模型。

Method: 采用基于插件的方法实现模型组件和操作，处理设备特定的实现细节，通过最小化的抽象操作集来描述系统功能。

Result: 开发了HiCR模型并实现了基于该模型的应用程序，这些应用能够在多样化的平台上同等运行，证明了模型的有效性和可移植性。

Conclusion: HiCR作为运行时支持层，成功提供了硬件无关的抽象，实现了跨平台的执行能力，为分布式异构系统的发展提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: We present HiCR, a model to represent the semantics of distributed
heterogeneous applications and runtime systems. The model describes a minimal
set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel
execution, memory management, communication, and instance management, without
prescribing any implementation decisions. The goal of the model is to enable
execution in current and future systems without the need for significant
refactoring, while also being able to serve any governing parallel programming
paradigm. In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between
distributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase
\emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the
model's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that
takes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of
HiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的流式压缩框架，在支持渐进解压缩和随机访问解压缩的同时，保持了高压缩质量和高速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪误质损失压缩是减少科学数据体积的最有效方法，但渐进解压缩和随机访问解压缩功能会严重影响压缩质量和速度。

Method: 设计了首个同时支持两种流式功能的压缩框架，采用层次分区策略和层次预测机制来减少分区影响并提高压缩质量。

Result: 压缩质量可与最先进非流式压缩器SZ3相比，压缩和解压缩速度最高可达SZ3的6.7倍。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了流式功能与压缩性能之间的争议，为科学数据处理提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression is one of the most efficient solutions to
reduce the volume of scientific data. For lossy compression, progressive
decompression and random-access decompression are critical features that enable
on-demand data access and flexible analysis workflows. However, these features
can severely degrade compression quality and speed. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel streaming compression framework that supports
both progressive decompression and random-access decompression while
maintaining high compression quality and speed. Our contributions are
three-fold: (1) we design the first compression framework that simultaneously
enables both progressive decompression and random-access decompression; (2) we
introduce a hierarchical partitioning strategy to enable both streaming
features, along with a hierarchical prediction mechanism that mitigates the
impact of partitioning and achieves high compression quality -- even comparable
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-streaming compressor SZ3; and (3) our framework
delivers high compression and decompression speed, up to 6.7$\times$ faster
than SZ3.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了SmartFill算法，解决了任意凹加速函数下的并行作业调度问题，通过一致性导数比(CDR)规则和广义注水(GWF)方法实现最优资源分配，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云/边缘计算系统中，多作业并行计算资源调度是一个基础问题。现有方法heSRPT仅适用于特定指数形式的加速函数，而实际工作负载更符合任意凹加速函数，这一般性问题一直未解决。

Method: 首先发现最优并行调度的基本规则——一致性导数比(CDR)规则，即活动作业间加速函数导数比保持恒定。提出广义注水(GWF)方法计算最优分配，并设计SmartFill算法选择性确定哪些作业应获得资源及分配量。

Result: 对于正则加速函数，SmartFill提供闭式最优解；对于非正则函数，能以低复杂度高效计算最优解。数值评估表明，SmartFill在各种凹加速函数下均显著优于heSRPT。

Conclusion: 本文解决了任意凹加速函数下并行作业调度的一般性问题，提出的CDR规则和SmartFill算法为实际云/边缘计算系统提供了高效的最优调度解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of parallel computation resources across multiple jobs
is a fundamental problem in modern cloud/edge computing systems for many
AI-based applications. Allocating more resources to a job accelerates its
completion, but with diminishing returns. Prior work (heSRPT) solved this
problem only for some specific speedup functions with an exponential form,
providing a closed-form solution. However, the general case with arbitrary
concave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads
-- has remained open.
  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling
algorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first
discover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel
scheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states
that the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs
remains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that
satisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more
general version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.
Combining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the
general scheduling problem. Unlike heSRPT, which always allocates resources to
all active jobs, SmartFill selectively determines which jobs should receive
resources and how much they should be allocated. For a broad class of so-called
\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal
solutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum
with low complexity. Numerical evaluations show that SmartFill can
substantially outperform heSRPT across a wide range of concave speedup
functions.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的Ising模型求解方法，通过将二元自旋松弛为连续变量并引入势函数，将哈密顿量表示为凸函数差，设计出具有收敛保证的高效迭代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Ising求解器主要基于模拟退火，虽然具有可扩展性但缺乏收敛保证且对冷却调度敏感，需要更可靠高效的求解方法。

Method: 将二元自旋松弛为连续变量，引入势函数引导解向二元自旋配置收敛，将哈密顿量表示为凸函数差形式，设计单次矩阵向量乘法迭代的高效算法。

Result: 在从边缘设备到高性能计算集群的各种GPU平台上实现，在10^3到10^8自旋的问题规模上均优于现有求解器。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种具有收敛保证的高效Ising问题求解方案，在多个硬件平台上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of
finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most
existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing
techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are
sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by
relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential
function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin
configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of
convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that
require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by
convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU
platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem
sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习依赖中央服务器，存在单点故障风险和同步延迟问题，需要异步分布式方案来提升可扩展性和响应能力

Method: 分两阶段开发：第一阶段建立异步FL框架，允许客户端独立学习和更新；第二阶段添加故障容锐机制，处理客户端故障和消息丢失。提出Client-Confident Convergence和Client-Responsive Termination算法

Result: 实现了异步分布式训练，允许客户端自主决定终止时机，确保所有活跃客户端都能高效有意义地完成训练

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了异步通信和故障环境下的收敛性问题，提供了更加可靠、可扩展的联邦学习方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training across
distributed clients while ensuring data privacy. Traditionally, FL relies on a
centralized server to coordinate learning, which creates bottlenecks and a
single point of failure. Decentralized FL architectures eliminate the need for
a central server and can operate in either synchronous or asynchronous modes.
Synchronous FL requires all clients to compute updates and wait for one another
before aggregation, guaranteeing consistency but often suffering from delays
due to slower participants. Asynchronous FL addresses this by allowing clients
to update independently, offering better scalability and responsiveness in
heterogeneous environments.
  Our research develops an asynchronous decentralized FL approach in two
progressive phases. (a) In Phase 1, we develop an asynchronous FL framework
that enables clients to learn and update independently, removing the need for
strict synchronization. (b) In Phase 2, we extend this framework with fault
tolerance mechanisms to handle client failures and message drops, ensuring
robust performance even under unpredictable conditions. As a central
contribution, we propose Client-Confident Convergence and Client-Responsive
Termination novel techniques that provide each client with the ability to
autonomously determine appropriate termination points. These methods ensure
that all active clients conclude meaningfully and efficiently, maintaining
reliable convergence despite the challenges of asynchronous communication and
faults.

Abstract: In blockchain sharding, $n$ processing nodes are divided into $s$ shards, and
each shard processes transactions in parallel. A key challenge in such a system
is to ensure system stability for any ``tractable'' pattern of generated
transactions; this is modeled by an adversary generating transactions with a
certain rate of at most $\rho$ and burstiness $b$. This model captures
worst-case scenarios and even some attacks on transactions' processing, e.g.,
DoS. A stable system ensures bounded transaction queue sizes and bounded
transaction latency. It is known that the absolute upper bound on the maximum
injection rate for which any scheduler could guarantee bounded queues and
latency of transactions is $\max\left\{ \frac{2}{k+1}, \frac{2}{
\left\lfloor\sqrt{2s}\right\rfloor}\right\}$, where $k$ is the maximum number
of shards that each transaction accesses. Here, we first provide a single
leader scheduler that guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq
\max\left\{ \frac{1}{16k}, \frac{1}{16\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil}\right\}$.
Moreover, we also give a distributed scheduler with multiple leaders that
guarantees stability under injection rate $\rho \leq \frac{1}{16c_1 \log D \log
s}\max\left\{ \frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\lceil \sqrt{s} \rceil} \right\}$, where
$c_1$ is some positive constant and $D$ is the diameter of shard graph $G_s$.
This bound is within a poly-log factor from the optimal injection rate, and
significantly improves the best previous known result for the distributed
setting by Adhikari et al., SPAA 2024.

Conclusion: 该技术为大规模图像分析提供了实用解决方案，实现了千兆像素图像分析的民主化，使主流计算机能够高效处理此类计算密集型任务。

Abstract: Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In
this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images
with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual
analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively
concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.

Result: QRMark相比顺序基线实现了平均2.43倍的推理加速

Conclusion: QRMark通过算法和系统层面的优化，有效解决了大规模图像水印检测的效率问题

Abstract: Efficient and reliable detection of generated images is critical for the
responsible deployment of generative models. Existing approaches primarily
focus on improving detection accuracy and robustness under various image
transformations and adversarial manipulations, yet they largely overlook the
efficiency challenges of watermark detection across large-scale image
collections. To address this gap, we propose QRMark, an efficient and adaptive
end-to-end method for detecting embedded image watermarks. The core idea of
QRMark is to combine QR Code inspired error correction with tailored tiling
techniques to improve detection efficiency while preserving accuracy and
robustness. At the algorithmic level, QRMark employs a Reed-Solomon error
correction mechanism to mitigate the accuracy degradation introduced by tiling.
At the system level, QRMark implements a resource-aware stream allocation
policy that adaptively assigns more streams to GPU-intensive stages of the
detection pipeline. It further employs a tile-based workload interleaving
strategy to overlap data-loading overhead with computation and schedules
kernels across stages to maximize efficiency. End-to-end evaluations show that
QRMark achieves an average 2.43x inference speedup over the sequential
baseline.

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一类新的可解释、可扩展的LLM驱动系统，用于管理复杂基础设施

Abstract: Kubernetes has become the foundation of modern cloud-native infrastructure,
yet its management remains complex and fragmented. Administrators must navigate
a vast API surface, manage heterogeneous workloads, and coordinate tasks across
disconnected tools - often requiring precise commands, YAML configuration, and
contextual expertise.
  This paper presents KubeIntellect, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered
system for intelligent, end-to-end Kubernetes control. Unlike existing tools
that focus on observability or static automation, KubeIntellect supports
natural language interaction across the full spectrum of Kubernetes API
operations, including read, write, delete, exec, access control, lifecycle, and
advanced verbs. The system uses modular agents aligned with functional domains
(e.g., logs, metrics, RBAC), orchestrated by a supervisor that interprets user
queries, maintains workflow memory, invokes reusable tools, or synthesizes new
ones via a secure Code Generator Agent.
  KubeIntellect integrates memory checkpoints, human-in-the-loop clarification,
and dynamic task sequencing into a structured orchestration framework.
Evaluation results show a 93% tool synthesis success rate and 100% reliability
across 200 natural language queries, demonstrating the system's ability to
operate efficiently under diverse workloads. An automated demo environment is
provided on Azure, with additional support for local testing via kind. This
work introduces a new class of interpretable, extensible, and LLM-driven
systems for managing complex infrastructure.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MLP-Offload是一个针对资源受限环境下大语言模型训练的多级多路径卸载引擎，通过优化I/O瓶颈，相比现有技术实现了2.5倍的迭代加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM模型规模的增长速度超过GPU内存容量，需要在多GPU聚合内存之外进行训练。现有的多级主机内存或磁盘卸载技术虽然采用了先进的异步读写策略，但在训练关键路径中仍产生显著的I/O开销，导致迭代速度变慢。

Method: 设计并实现了MLP-Offload，通过缓存高效和并发控制的方式，在多级存储层级间卸载优化器状态，以缓解反向传播和更新阶段的I/O瓶颈。该方法基于几个关键观察：更新阶段的I/O开销主导迭代时间、第三级远程存储带宽未被充分利用、并发卸载导致的争用加剧了I/O瓶颈。

Result: 在高达280B参数的模型评估中，MLP-Offload相比最先进的LLM训练运行时实现了2.5倍的迭代加速。

Conclusion: MLP-Offload通过多级多路径的卸载策略有效解决了LLM训练中的I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了训练效率，特别适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is
increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU
memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are
proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write
strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in
the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we
propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine
specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained
setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that
drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update
dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage
tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies
I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload
to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and
concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward
and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that
MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the

TL;DR: eEnergy-Split是一个基于分割学习的高效能框架，用于智能农业中的协作模型训练，相比联邦学习可减少86%的设备能耗并提升分类准确率，同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能农业系统面临的资源有限、数据隐私需求和农村地区连接性差等挑战，需要在边缘设备上实现高效、隐私保护的模型训练。

Method: 采用分割学习(SL)技术，将模型分布在边缘设备和中央服务器之间；提出最优边缘部署算法和基于TSP精确求解的无人机轨迹规划策略；在农业害虫数据集上进行全面评估。

Result: 相比联邦学习：能耗降低86%；ResNet-18准确率提升6.2%；GoogleNet和MobileNetV2有适度提升；无人机能耗降低，整体准确率提升达17%。

Conclusion: 分割学习与能量感知设计结合，可为资源受限的智能农业环境提供可扩展、隐私保护的解决方案，但能效受模型类型影响，轻量模型收益更大。

Abstract: Smart farming systems encounter significant challenges, including limited
resources, the need for data privacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas. To
address these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework
that utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training
without direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By
distributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split
reduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated
learning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves
classification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more
modest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge
deployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and
maximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest
datasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to
baseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the
energy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial
savings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory
overheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results
highlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a
scalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming
environments.

Abstract: Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in
modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive
coverage across a plethora of applications. The expanding demand for
high-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations
highlight the limitations of traditional exclusive satellite spectrum
allocation approaches. Cognitive Radio (CR) leading to Cognitive Satellite

SatCom, and deep dive into DSM techniques, which enable CogSat networks.
Furthermore, we extensively evaluate and categorize state-of-the-art Artificial

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: SPLIDT是一个在可编程数据平面中部署决策树的系统，通过滑动窗口分区推理和资源复用技术，显著提升了模型准确性和可扩展性，支持5倍以上的状态特征数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络内决策树实现受限于需要预先计算所有输入特征，只能使用少量固定特征集，严重限制了模型准确性和在严格硬件资源约束下的可扩展性。

Method: SPLIDT引入两个关键创新：1) 将不同可变特征集分配给决策树的各个子树分区；2) 利用带内控制通道通过重循环在分区间复用数据平面资源。系统还包含定制训练和设计空间探索框架，联合优化特征分配、树分区和模型深度。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的评估显示，SPLIDT比现有方法(如NetBeacon和Leo)实现了更高准确性，支持多达5倍的状态特征，保持相同的低检测时间，同时扩展到数百万流，重循环开销小于0.05%。

Conclusion: SPLIDT通过重新思考数据平面中的决策树部署方式，解决了现有实现的特征限制问题，为实时流量分析和安全监控提供了更准确和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being deployed in programmable data
planes (switches and SmartNICs) to enable real-time traffic analysis, security
monitoring, and in-network decision-making. Decision trees (DTs) are
particularly well-suited for these tasks due to their interpretability and
compatibility with data-plane architectures, i.e., match-action tables (MATs).
However, existing in-network DT implementations are constrained by the need to
compute all input features upfront, forcing models to rely on a small, fixed
set of features per flow. This significantly limits model accuracy and
scalability under stringent hardware resource constraints.
  We present SPLIDT, a system that rethinks DT deployment in the data plane by
enabling partitioned inference over sliding windows of packets. SPLIDT
introduces two key innovations: (1) it assigns distinct, variable feature sets
to individual sub-trees of a DT, grouped into partitions, and (2) it leverages
an in-band control channel (via recirculation) to reuse data-plane resources
(both stateful registers and match keys) across partitions at line rate. These
insights allow SPLIDT to scale the number of stateful features a model can use
without exceeding hardware limits. To support this architecture, SPLIDT
incorporates a custom training and design-space exploration (DSE) framework
that jointly optimizes feature allocation, tree partitioning, and DT model
depth. Evaluation across multiple real-world datasets shows that SPLIDT
achieves higher accuracy while supporting up to 5x more stateful features than
prior approaches (e.g., NetBeacon and Leo). It maintains the same low
time-to-detection (TTD) as these systems, while scaling to millions of flows
with minimal recirculation overhead (<0.05%).

TL;DR: SmartFLow是一个基于SDN的框架，通过动态调整路由路径来减少跨机构联邦学习中的网络拥塞，将参数同步时间减少高达47%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨机构联邦学习中，客户端需要频繁与中央服务器交换模型权重，网络性能对整体训练时间影响很大。传统路由方法无法有效防止拥塞，导致通信延迟增加和训练时间延长

Method: 利用软件定义网络(SDN)的集中式可编程控制特性，设计SmartFLow框架，根据网络条件动态调整路由路径，减少拥塞并提高同步效率

Result: 实验结果显示，SmartFLow相比最短路径路由减少参数同步时间47%，相比容量感知路由减少41%，计算开销最小，可扩展到50个客户端网络

Conclusion: SmartFLow框架通过SDN技术有效提升了跨机构联邦学习的通信效率，具有实际部署的可行性，为现实世界的联邦学习部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Cross-silo Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple institutions to
collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. In
such settings, clients repeatedly exchange model weights with a central server,
making the overall training time highly sensitive to network performance.
However, conventional routing methods often fail to prevent congestion, leading
to increased communication latency and prolonged training. Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), which provides centralized and programmable control over
network resources, offers a promising way to address this limitation. To this
end, we propose SmartFLow, an SDN-based framework designed to enhance
communication efficiency in cross-silo FL. SmartFLow dynamically adjusts
routing paths in response to changing network conditions, thereby reducing
congestion and improving synchronization efficiency. Experimental results show
that SmartFLow decreases parameter synchronization time by up to 47% compared
to shortest-path routing and 41% compared to capacity-aware routing.
Furthermore, it achieves these gains with minimal computational overhead and
scales effectively to networks of up to 50 clients, demonstrating its
practicality for real-world FL deployments.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习评估工具往往无法模拟真实操作条件，简化了算法效率、客户端异构性和网络基础设施之间的关键动态关系，导致理论设计与实际性能之间存在显著差距。

Method: 开发FLEET测试平台，集成框架无关的学习组件和高保真网络仿真器，支持多种机器学习框架、可定制真实网络拓扑和动态背景流量生成，收集算法结果与网络统计数据的综合指标。

Conclusion: FLEET为研究社区提供了一个强大的工具，能够弥合算法理论与真实网络条件之间的差距，促进联邦学习系统的整体性和可重复性评估。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents a robust paradigm for privacy-preserving,
decentralized machine learning. However, a significant gap persists between the
theoretical design of FL algorithms and their practical performance, largely
because existing evaluation tools often fail to model realistic operational
conditions. Many testbeds oversimplify the critical dynamics among algorithmic
efficiency, client-level heterogeneity, and continuously evolving network
infrastructure. To address this challenge, we introduce the Federated Learning
Emulation and Evaluation Testbed (FLEET). This comprehensive platform provides
a scalable and configurable environment by integrating a versatile,
framework-agnostic learning component with a high-fidelity network emulator.
FLEET supports diverse machine learning frameworks, customizable real-world
network topologies, and dynamic background traffic generation. The testbed
collects holistic metrics that correlate algorithmic outcomes with detailed
network statistics. By unifying the entire experiment configuration, FLEET
enables researchers to systematically investigate how network constraints, such
as limited bandwidth, high latency, and packet loss, affect the convergence and
efficiency of FL algorithms. This work provides the research community with a
robust tool to bridge the gap between algorithmic theory and real-world network
conditions, promoting the holistic and reproducible evaluation of federated
learning systems.

Method: 开发了一个无监督框架，能够自动识别和移除对训练无用的流量（如无关协议、后台活动、控制平面消息和长会话），无需人工干预。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估显示，该框架相比人工清理仅导致分类准确率下降2%~2.5%，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于机器学习的加密流量分类提供了一个高效且有效的预处理步骤，显著降低了数据清理的成本和时间消耗。

Abstract: Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined
categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With
the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in
mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional
methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted
traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular
Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted
traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is
traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training
(e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and
long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection
of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In
this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans
encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our
framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared
with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an
efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic
classification.

TL;DR: ReWeave是一种可扩展的高效链路级流量工程方案，通过为每个链路配备紧凑的相邻备份路径集，实现本地化重路由，在链路故障时仅需两端路由器使用SRv6绕行动态重路由流量，无需控制器干预或全路径重新计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISP网络中链路故障频繁发生，现有流量工程方案要么在易受攻击的静态路径上重路由导致性能下降，要么为广泛故障场景预计算备份路由带来高开销和可扩展性限制，需要一种在受限开销下提供足够路径多样性的有效故障恢复机制。

Method: ReWeave为每个链路配备紧凑的相邻备份路径集，检测到故障时仅由故障链路两端路由器使用SRv6绕行动态重路由流量，无需控制器干预或全路径重新计算，实现本地化重路由。

Result: 在大规模骨干网络评估中，ReWeave在链路故障场景下优于现有TE方案。相比最先进的集中控制动态流量重分配方案HARP，平均最大链路利用率降低10.5%~20.1%，最坏情况利用率降低29.5%~40.9%。相比保护型方案Flexile，在90%故障情况下实现相似的低丢包率，同时保持与最快路由器本地重路由方案相当的响应速度。

Conclusion: ReWeave提供了一种可扩展且高效的链路级流量工程方案，通过本地化重路由和紧凑备份路径集，在链路故障时实现快速恢复和性能优化，同时保持低开销和高可扩展性。

Abstract: Link failures occur frequently in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks
and pose significant challenges for Traffic Engineering (TE). Existing TE
schemes either reroute traffic over vulnerable static paths, leading to
performance degradation, or precompute backup routes for a broad range of
failure scenarios, which introduces high overhead and limits scalability.
Hence, an effective failure recovery mechanism is required to offer sufficient
path diversity under constrained overhead, thereby ensuring robust and
performant network operation. This paper presents ReWeave, a scalable and
efficient link-level TE scheme that enables localized rerouting by equipping
each link with a compact set of adjacent-only backup paths. Upon detecting a
failure, only the routers at both ends of the failed link reroute traffic
dynamically using SRv6-based detours, without controller intervention or
full-path recomputation. Evaluation results on large-scale backbone networks
demonstrate that ReWeave outperforms existing TE schemes in link failure
scenarios. Compared to HARP, the state-of-the-art failure recovery scheme based
on centralized control and dynamic traffic reallocation, our approach reduces
the average maximum link utilization by 10.5%~20.1%, and lowers the worst-case
utilization by 29.5%~40.9%. When compared with Flexile, a protection-based
scheme that precomputes routes for multi-failure scenarios, ReWeave achieves a
similarly low packet loss rate in 90% of failure cases, while maintaining a
response speed comparable to the fastest router-based local rerouting schemes.

Motivation: 多通道遇合问题(MRP)在IoT应用中致关重要，但当缺少全局通道编号系统时，现有方法无法有效工作。需要一种新的算法来处理通道标签为唯一L比特标识符的情况。

Conclusion: 这些基于LSH的算法为缺少全局通道编号系统的IoT环境提供了高效的多通道遇合解决方案，在保持低复杂度的同时确保了良好的遇合性能。

Abstract: The multichannel rendezvous problem (MRP) is a critical challenge for
neighbor discovery in IoT applications, requiring two users to find each other
by hopping among available channels over time. This paper addresses the MRP in
scenarios where a global channel enumeration system is unavailable. To tackle
this challenge, we propose a suite of low-complexity multichannel rendezvous
algorithms based on locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), tailored for environments
where channel labels are unique L-bit identifiers rather than globally
coordinated indices. Inspired by consistent hashing techniques in distributed
systems, we develop the LC-LSH and LC-LSH4 algorithms for synchronous and
asynchronous settings, respectively. These algorithms significantly reduce
implementation complexity while maintaining expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR)
performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that require global channel
enumeration. To ensure bounded maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) in the
asynchronous setting, we further introduce the ASYM-LC-LSH4 and QR-LC-LSH4
algorithms by embedding multiset-enhanced modular clock and quasi-random
techniques into our framework. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the
proposed algorithms achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LSH
algorithms in both synchronous and asynchronous settings, even without a global
channel enumeration system.

Abstract: This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and
Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing end-to-end (E2E) network
services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and
beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing
their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present
study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing
leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware
availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of
Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator
for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and
cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the
best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any
QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the
optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is
evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and
inference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for
the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior
accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and
loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for
higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity
problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in
advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data
availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are
identified as future research lines.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于马尔可夫链的Wi-Fi 7多链路操作(MLO)分析模型，用于准确评估Wi-Fi 7与旧设备共存时的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi 7引入的多链路操作(MLO)相比传统单链路操作能显著提升吞吐量和降低延迟，但现有研究忽略了MLO的关键特性，需要开发符合标准的分析框架来建模MLO的实际信道访问机制。

Method: 设计了两套分别针对AP和非AP多链路设备(MLD)的马尔可夫链模型，推导了饱和流量条件下的传输和碰撞概率，并得出了Wi-Fi 7与旧设备共存场景中各设备类型的吞吐量闭式表达式。

Result: 通过基于ns-3的仿真验证，所提出的分析模型能够准确估计每个设备的吞吐量性能，并揭示了WLAN间共存场景的动态特性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Wi-Fi 7 MLO分析建模的空白，为理解和优化多链路操作与旧设备的共存性能提供了有效的理论工具和仿真验证。

Abstract: Wi-Fi 7 introduces Multi-link operation (MLO) to enhance throughput and
latency performance compared to legacy Wi-Fi standards. MLO enables
simultaneous transmission and reception through multiple links, departing from
conventional single-link operations (SLO). To fully exploit MLO's potential, it
is essential to investigate Wi-Fi 7's coexistence performance with legacy Wi-Fi
devices. Existing approaches, however, have overlooked some crucial aspects of
MLO, necessitating the development of a standards-compliant analytical
framework to model the actual channel access mechanism of MLO. Therefore, this
paper tries to fill the gap by proposing a set of novel Markov chains (MC) to
accurately model the MLO operation aligned with multi-link backoff behaviors
specified by the standard. Specifically, we design two separate MCs for AP and
non-AP multi-link devices (MLD) respectively, based on which transmit and
collision probabilities are derived under the saturated traffic condition.
Then, we also derive closed-form expressions for the throughput of various
device types in the coexistence scenario between Wi-Fi 7 and legacy Wi-Fi,
including AP MLD, non- AP MLD, and legacy devices. To validate the accuracy of
our proposed models, we developed an ns-3 based simulator by implementing both
STR(simultaneous transmission and reception) and NSTR(non-STR) based MLO
operations. Our ns-3 based extensive simulations have demonstrated that the
proposed analytic model provides accurate estimates on the per device
throughput performance, while also revealing the dynamics of inter-WLAN
coexistence scenarios.

Abstract: During the development of the Sixth Generation (6G) networks, the integration
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into network systems has become a focal point,
leading to the concept of AI-native networks. High quality data is essential
for developing such networks. Although some studies have explored data
collection and analysis in 6G networks, significant challenges remain,
particularly in real-time data acquisition and processing. This paper proposes
a comprehensive data collection method that operates in parallel with bitstream
processing for wireless communication networks. By deploying data probes, the
system captures real-time network and system status data in software-defined
wireless communication networks. Furthermore, a data support system is
implemented to integrate heterogeneous data and provide automatic support for
AI model training and decision making. Finally, a 6G communication testbed
using OpenAirInterface5G and Open5GS is built on Kubernetes, as well as the
system's functionality is demonstrated via a network traffic prediction case

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于分布式收据的AAV辅助转发系统，通过深度强化学习优化自主航空器的飞行轨迹和通信调度，最小化信息龄龄期和能消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AAV辅助数据传输受限于有限通信覆盖范围，需要周期性返回飞行进行数据中继，导致延迟峰值增加信息龄龄期(AoI)并降低服务可靠性。

Method: 通过AAV协作进行分布式收据收集和中继传感器数据，形成优化问题关联优化AAV飞行轨迹和通信调度。采用深度强化学习解决方案，包含时序序列输入、层标准化门控循环单元和squeeze-and-excitation块来提高决策稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分布式收据技术有效提升了AAV辅助IoT网络中的信息新鲜度和及时性，减少了能消耗，为远程或服务不足地区的数据传输提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of low-altitude wireless networking, autonomous
aerial vehicles (AAVs) have emerged as critical enablers for timely and
reliable data delivery, particularly in remote or underserved areas. In this
context, the age of information (AoI) has emerged as a critical performance
metric for evaluating the freshness and timeliness of transmitted information
in Internet of things (IoT) networks. However, conventional AAV-assisted data
transmission is fundamentally limited by finite communication coverage ranges,
which requires periodic return flights for data relay operations. This
propulsion-repositioning cycle inevitably introduces latency spikes that raise
the AoI while degrading service reliability. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a AAV-assisted forwarding system based on distributed
beamforming to enhance the AoI in IoT. Specifically, AAVs collaborate via
distributed beamforming to collect and relay data between the sensor nodes and
remote base station. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the
AoI and AAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectories and
communication schedules. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem and its
pronounced temporal variability, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning
solution that incorporates temporal sequence input, layer normalization gated
recurrent unit, and a squeeze-and-excitation block to capture long-term
dependencies, thereby improving decision-making stability and accuracy, and
reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed SAC-TLS algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of
convergence, time average AoI, and energy consumption of AAVs.

Abstract: We propose a framework for resource provisioning with QoS guarantees in

is a Modified Dirft-plus-Penalty (MDP) policy that ensures long-term stability
while capturing short-term probabilistic service guarantees using linearized
upper-confidence bounds. We characterize the feasible region of service
guarantees and show that our MDP procedure achieves mean rate stability and an
optimality gap that vanishes with the frame size over which service guarantees
are provided. Finally, empirical simulations validate our theory and
demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm in handling QoS in
multi-infrastructure networks.

Abstract: The transformation of 5G networks into software-defined, agile, intelligent
and programmable architectures necessitates a paradigm shift in deployment
strategies. To deliver superior performance and surpass traditional systems,
public and private 5G networks must adopt software-centric cloud native
frameworks that enable flexibility through tailored configurations and
optimized deployment approaches. In Singapore, the Infocomm Media Development
Authority (IMDA) and the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF) launched
the Future Communications Research and Development Programme (FCP) to advance
the nation's communications and connectivity landscape. At the core of this
initiative is the Future Communications Translation Lab (FCT) at the Singapore
Institute of Technology (SIT), which focuses on advancing 5G technologies to
higher readiness levels, facilitating their adoption across various industries.
A key component is the deployment of FCT O-RAN, a state-of-the-art multi-vendor
private 5G platform. The setup includes a 5G core network powered by Microsoft
Affirmed and ENEA, O-RAN Centralized and Distributed Units from Radisys. Indoor
Remote Units are deployed with Foxconn, while outdoor RUs are deployed with
Benetel. To optimize the deployment of remote units, a digital twin was created
using Wireless InSite, and performance evaluations were conducted for both the
digital twin and the private 5G deployment. Smartphones equipped with QualiPoc
were used to measure network performance. The testbed demonstrated effective
performance with optimized bandwidth allocations for both indoor and outdoor
environments. In the indoor setup, utilizing 50 MHz of bandwidth, a downlink
throughput of 713 Mbps and an uplink throughput of 66 Mbps were achieved.
Meanwhile, the outdoor setup, utilizing 40 MHz of bandwidth, achieved a
downlink throughput of 371 Mbps and an uplink throughput of 55 Mbps.

Method: 开发了一种自适应的机器学习分割方案，基于实时AI动力向通过量估计，动态调整DNN模型在用户设备和边缘服务器之间的分割点。

Conclusion: 通过动态自适应的模型分割策略，可以有效平衡移动设备图像处理中的性能、能耗和隐私要求，为5G环境下的分布式AI计算提供优化解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile devices increasingly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for complex
inference tasks, but running entire models locally drains the device battery
quickly. Offloading computation entirely to cloud or edge servers reduces
processing load at devices but poses privacy risks and can incur high network
bandwidth consumption and long delays. Split computing (SC) mitigates these
challenges by partitioning DNNs between user equipment (UE) and edge servers.
However, 5G wireless channels are time-varying and a fixed splitting scheme can
lead to sub-optimal solutions. This paper addresses the limitations of fixed
model partitioning in privacy-focused image processing and explores trade-offs
in key performance metrics, including end-to-end (E2E) latency, energy
consumption, and privacy, by developing an adaptive ML partitioning scheme
based on real-time AI-powered throughput estimation. Evaluation in multiple
scenarios demonstrates significant performance gains of our scheme.

<details>

Motivation: 多个相关源通过有限通信资源传输观测数据到接收端进行实时推理，需要考虑数据新鲜度(AoI)对推理精度的影响，但传统RMAB方法因源间相关性无法直接应用

Method: 通过近似每个源的罚函数并建立近似误差界，为两种情况开发调度策略：(1)知道罚函数时提出异步治理下的优化间隔上界；(2)未知罚函数时使用带有bandit反馈的在线学习方法(MGF策略)

Result: 模拟结果证明所提策略能有效最小化推理错误，并在源数量增长时保持可扩展性

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了相关多源RMAB调度问题，通过AoI指标实现了信号无关的高效推理，为实时远程推理系统提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: We investigate a real-time remote inference system where multiple correlated
sources transmit observations over a communication channel to a receiver. The
receiver utilizes these observations to infer multiple time-varying targets.
Due to limited communication resources, the delivered observations may not be
fresh. To quantify data freshness, we employ the Age of Information (AoI)
metric. To minimize the inference error, we aim to design a signal-agnostic
scheduling policy that leverages AoI without requiring knowledge of the actual
target values or the source observations. This scheduling problem is a restless
multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem with a non-separable penalty function. Unlike
traditional RMABs, the correlation among sources introduces a unique challenge:
the penalty function of each source depends on the AoI of other correlated
sources, preventing decomposition of the problem into multiple independent
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), a key step in applying traditional RMAB
solutions. To address this, we propose a novel approach by approximating the
penalty function of each source and establish an analytical bound on the
approximation error. We then develop scheduling policies for two scenarios: (i)
full knowledge of the penalty functions and (ii) no knowledge of the penalty
functions. For the case of known penalty functions, we present an upper bound
on the optimality gap of our policy in the asymptotic regime. For the case of
unknown penalty functions and signal distributions, we develop an online
learning approach that utilizes bandit feedback to learn an online Maximum Gain
First (MGF) policy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed policies in minimizing inference error and achieving scalability in
the number of sources.

Conclusion: FFMs有望在极端和对抗性条件下实现鲁棒、节能和自适应的智能系统，为解决恶劣环境中的AI部署问题提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generalized
intelligence, multimodal understanding, and adaptive learning across a wide
range of domains. However, their deployment in harsh or austere environments --
characterized by intermittent connectivity, limited computation, noisy data,
and dynamically changing network topologies -- remains an open challenge.
Existing distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) struggle
to adapt in such settings due to their reliance on stable infrastructure,
synchronized updates, and resource-intensive training. In this work, we explore
the potential of Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) as a promising paradigm to
address these limitations. By integrating the scalability and generalization
power of FMs with novel decentralized, communication-aware FL frameworks, we
aim to enable robust, energy-efficient, and adaptive intelligence in extreme
and adversarial conditions. We present a detailed breakdown of system-level
constraints in harsh environments, and discuss the open research challenges in
communication design, model robustness, and energy-efficient personalization
for these unique settings.

Abstract: The escalating demands of immersive communications, alongside advances in
network softwarization and AI-driven cognition and generative reasoning, create
a pivotal opportunity to rethink and reshape the future Internet. In this
context, we introduce in this paper, FlexNGIA 2.0, an Agentic AI-driven
Internet architecture that leverages LLM-based AI agents to autonomously
orchestrate, configure, and evolve the network. These agents can, at runtime,
perceive, reason, coordinate among themselves to dynamically design, implement,
deploy, and adapt communication protocols, Service Function Chains (SFCs),
network functions, resource allocation strategies, congestion control, and
traffic engineering schemes, thereby ensuring optimal performance, reliability,
and efficiency under evolving conditions.
  The paper first outlines the overall architecture of FlexNGIA 2.0 and its
constituent LLM-Based AI agents. For each agent, we detail its design,
implementation, inputs and outputs, prompt structures, interactions with tools
and other agents, followed by preliminary proof-of-concept experiments
demonstrating its operation and potential. The results clearly highlight the
ability of these LLM-based AI agents to automate the design, the
implementation, the deployment, and the performance evaluation of transport
protocols, service function chains, network functions, congestion control
schemes, and resource allocation strategies.
  FlexNGIA 2.0 paves the way for a new class of Agentic AI-Driven networks,
where fully cognitive, self-evolving AI agents can autonomously design,
implement, adapt and optimize the network's protocols, algorithms, and
behaviors to efficiently operate across complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous
environments. To bring this vision to reality, we also identify key research
challenges toward achieving fully autonomous, adaptive, and agentic AI-driven
networks.

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that
simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and
meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment
routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists
of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a
high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128).
The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that
combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end
latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined
network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of
Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing
schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a
PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms
between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a
slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite

Abstract: The rapid development of AI agents leads to a surge in communication demands.
Alongside this rise, a variety of frameworks and protocols emerge. While these
efforts demonstrate the vitality of the field, they also highlight increasing
fragmentation, with redundant innovation and siloed designs hindering
cross-domain interoperability. These challenges underscore the need for a
systematic perspective to guide the development of scalable, secure, and
sustainable AI agent ecosystems. To address this need, this paper provides the
first systematic analysis of AI agent communication from the standpoint of
Internet architecture-the most successful global-scale distributed system in
history. Specifically, we distill decades of Internet evolution into five key
elements that are directly relevant to agent communication: scalability,
security, real-time performance, high performance, and manageability. We then
use these elements to examine both the opportunities and the bottlenecks in
developing robust multi-agent ecosystems. Overall, this paper bridges Internet
architecture and AI agent communication for the first time, providing a new
lens for guiding the sustainable growth of AI agent communication ecosystems.

Abstract: Battery management systems (BMSs) are critical to ensuring safety,
efficiency, and longevity across electronics, transportation, and energy
storage. However, with the rapid growth of lithium-ion batteries, conventional
reactive BMS approaches face limitations in health prediction and advanced
maintenance management, resulting in increased safety risks and economic costs.
To address these challenges, we propose a five-tier digital twin framework for
intelligent battery management. The framework spans geometric visualization,
predictive modeling, prescriptive optimization, and autonomous operation,
enabling full lifecycle optimization. In validation, an electrochemical model
calibrated via Bayesian optimization achieved strong alignment with measured
voltage and temperature, with Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) below
1.57\% and 0.39\%. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) then combined data
and simulations to predict State of Health (SOH), attaining MAPE under 3\% with
quantified uncertainty. This framework elevates BMSs into intelligent systems
capable of proactive management and autonomous optimization, advancing safety

Conclusion: EPSR方案在集合协调场景中实现了通信效率的显著提升，为分布式系统中集合同步问题提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: In this work, a set reconciliation setting is considered in which two parties
have similar sets that they would like to reconcile. In particular, we focus on
a divide-and-conquer strategy known as partitioned set reconciliation (PSR), in
which the sets to be reconciled are successively partitioned until they contain
a number of differences below some predetermined value. Borrowing techniques
from tree-algorithms for random-access protocols, we present and analyze a
novel set reconciliation scheme that we term enhanced partitioned set
reconciliation (EPSR). This approach improves the efficiency in terms of
overhead, i.e., it yields a lower communication cost, while keeping the same
time and communication round complexity as PSR. Additionally, we simulate the
performance of the proposed algorithm in an event-driven simulator. Our
findings indicate that this novel protocol nearly halves the communication cost
of PSR while maintaining the same time complexity.

network conditions, efficiently analyze valuable radio data, and innovate
applications through user-friendly, immersive interfaces. Building on this
foundation, network digital twins (NDTs) accurately depict the operational
processes and attributes of network infrastructures, facilitating predictive
management through real-time analysis and measurement. However, constructing
precise NDTs poses challenges, such as integrating diverse data sources,
mapping necessary attributes from physical networks, and maintaining
scalability for various downstream tasks. Unlike previous works that focused on
the creation and mapping of NDTs from scratch, we explore intra- and
inter-operations among NDTs within a Unified Twin Transformation (UTT)
framework, which uncovers a new computing paradigm for efficient transfer,
merging, and splitting of NDTs to create task-oriented twins. By leveraging
joint multi-modal and distributed mapping mechanisms, UTT optimizes resource
utilization and reduces the cost of creating NDTs, while ensuring twin model
consistency. A theoretical analysis of the distributed mapping problem is
conducted to establish convergence bounds for this multi-modal gated
aggregation process. Evaluations on real-world twin-assisted applications, such
as trajectory reconstruction, human localization, and sensory data generation,
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of interoperability among NDTs
for corresponding task development.

### [496] [ChopChop: a Programmable Framework for Semantically Constraining the Output of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00360)
*Shaan Nagy,Timothy Zhou,Nadia Polikarpova,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: ChopChop是一个可编程的语义约束解码框架，通过连接token级生成和抽象程序结构推理，使语言模型能够生成可证明满足丰富语义属性的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束解码方法仅限于浅层语法约束或依赖脆弱的语义编码，无法保证生成代码的正确性和语义属性。

Method: 采用基于共归纳的形式化方法，将约束执行转化为正则共数据的可实现性问题，连接token级生成与程序结构推理。

Result: 在类型安全和程序等价性约束下展示了通用性，提高了模型在各种任务上的成功率，同时保持实用的解码延迟。

Conclusion: ChopChop将语义约束解码从小众技术转变为系统化、原则性的语言模型扩展，实现了形式化方法与LM驱动代码生成的无缝集成。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) can generate code, but cannot guarantee its
correctness--producing outputs that often violate type safety, program
invariants, or semantic equivalence. Constrained decoding offers a solution by
restricting generation to programs that satisfy desired properties. Yet,
existing methods are limited to shallow syntactic constraints or rely on
brittle, ad hoc encodings of semantics over token sequences.
  We present ChopChop, the first programmable framework for semantic
constrained decoding, enabling LMs to generate code that provably satisfies
rich semantic properties. ChopChop connects token-level generation with
reasoning over abstract program structures using a coinduction-based formalism
and reduces constraint enforcement to a realizability problem over regular
codata. We demonstrate ChopChop's generality through generation constrained by
type safety and program equivalence, showing how formal methods can be
seamlessly integrated into LM-driven code generation. ChopChop transforms
semantic constrained decoding from a niche technique into a systematic,
principled extension of LMs--improving success rates across models and tasks
while maintaining practical decoding latency.

*Vaibhav Mehta,Justin Hsu*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于验证程序对称性属性的形式化方法，包括群动作语法设计和Hoare风格逻辑系统，并开发了原型工具SymVerif进行验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多程序正确性属性可以用对称性表述，但现有形式化方法缺乏对此类属性的推理支持，需要开发专门的验证框架

Method: 设计群动作语法支持标准构造和蕴含关系，开发基于Hoare逻辑的验证系统，用群动作替代传统前后条件断言，并实现原型工具SymVerif

Result: 在手工制作的基准测试集上验证了对称性属性，工具发现了McLachlan和Quispel(2002)描述的动态系统模型中的一个错误

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效验证广泛的对称性属性，为程序对称性验证提供了实用的形式化框架和工具支持

Abstract: Many natural program correctness properties can be stated in terms of
  symmetries, but existing formal methods have little support for reasoning
  about such properties. We consider how to formally verify a broad class of
  symmetry properties expressed in terms of group actions. To specify these
  properties, we design a syntax for group actions, supporting standard
  constructions and a natural notion of entailment. Then, we develop a
  Hoare-style logic for verifying symmetry properties of imperative programs,
  where group actions take the place of the typical pre- and post-condition
  assertions. Finally, we develop a prototype tool $\mathsf{SymVerif}$, and use
  it to verify symmetry properties on a series of handcrafted benchmarks. Our
  tool uncovered an error in a model of a dynamical system described by
\citet{McLachlan_Quispel_2002}.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的G代码分析算法，通过将G代码转换为立方体集合和点云表示，支持三维打印制造流程中的错误定位、切片器比较和网格修复工具效果评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编译器的程序不变量检查和差分测试技术无法直接应用于三维打印制造流程，因为3D模型既是几何对象又是机器代码，需要新方法来提高制造管道的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一种新的G代码提取算法，将G代码程序转换为立方体集合，并定义了近似点云表示来高效操作这些立方体。实现了原型工具GlitchFinder。

Result: 在58个实际CAD模型上评估，结果显示GlitchFinder能有效识别小特征导致的切片问题，对比不同切片器的差异，以及发现网格修复工具在修复过程中引入的新错误。

Conclusion: 该算法为三维打印制造流程开启了新的可能性，包括CAD模型不变量检查、切片器定量比较和网格修复工具效果评估，显著提高了制造过程的可靠性和质量控制。

Abstract: The computational fabrication pipeline for 3D printing is much like a
compiler - users design models in Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools that are
lowered to polygon meshes to be ultimately compiled to machine code by 3D
slicers. For traditional compilers and programming languages, techniques for
checking program invariants are well-established. Similarly, methods like
differential testing are often used to uncover bugs in compilers themselves,
which makes them more reliable. The fabrication pipeline would benefit from
similar techniques but traditional approaches do not directly apply to the
representations used in this domain. Unlike traditional programs, 3D models
exist both as geometric objects as well as machine code that ultimately runs on
the hardware. The machine code, like in traditional compiling, is affected by
many factors like the model, the slicer being used, and numerous
user-configurable parameters that control the slicing process. In this work, we
propose a new algorithm for lifting G-code (a common language used in
fabrication pipelines) by denoting a G-code program to a set of cuboids, and
then defining an approximate point cloud representation for efficiently
operating on these cuboids. Our algorithm opens up new opportunities: we show
three use cases that demonstrate how it enables error localization in CAD
models through invariant checking, quantitative comparisons between slicers,
and evaluating the efficacy of mesh repair tools. We present a prototype
implementation of our algorithm in a tool, GlitchFinder, and evaluate it on 58
real-world CAD models. Our results show that GlitchFinder is particularly
effective in identifying slicing issues due to small features, can highlight
differences in how popular slicers (Cura and PrusaSlicer) slice the same model,
and can identify cases where mesh repair tools (MeshLab and Meshmixer)
introduce new errors during repair.

*Denghang Hu,Taolue Chen,Philipp Rümmer,Fu Song,Zhilin Wu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了字符串序列理论，通过将字符串序列编码为字符串并限制在直线片段内来恢复可判定性，实现了基于OSTRICH框架的决策工具ostrichseq。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMT求解器只支持通用序列理论，但缺乏对字符串操作（如正则表达式匹配、字符串分割和连接）的直接支持，而这些操作在字符串处理程序中经常使用。

Method: 提出字符串序列理论，将每个字符串序列编码为字符串，并将字符串序列操作映射为相应的字符串操作。通过限制在直线片段内恢复可判定性，并利用OSTRICH框架实现自动机的前像计算。

Result: 实现了ostrichseq工具，在真实JavaScript程序生成的基准约束、手工制作的模板和单元测试上进行了实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 虽然字符串序列理论在一般情况下是不可判定的，但通过限制到直线片段可以恢复可判定性，所提出的方法在实际应用中表现出良好的效果。

Abstract: The theory of sequences, supported by many SMT solvers, can model program
data types including bounded arrays and lists. Sequences are parameterized by
the element data type and provide operations such as accessing elements,
concatenation, forming sub-sequences and updating elements. Strings and
sequences are intimately related; many operations, e.g., matching a string
according to a regular expression, splitting strings, or joining strings in a
sequence, are frequently used in string-manipulating programs. Nevertheless,
these operations are typically not directly supported by existing SMT solvers,
which instead only consider the generic theory of sequences. In this paper, we
propose a theory of string sequences and study its satisfiability. We show
that, while it is undecidable in general, the decidability can be recovered by
restricting to the straight-line fragment. This is shown by encoding each
string sequence as a string, and each string sequence operation as a
corresponding string operation. We provide pre-image computation for the
resulting string operations with respect to automata, effectively casting it
into the generic OSTRICH string constraint solving framework. We implement the
new decision procedure as a tool $\ostrichseq$, and carry out experiments on
benchmark constraints generated from real-world JavaScript programs,
hand-crafted templates and unit tests. The experiments confirm the efficacy of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 覆盖类型支持must-style欠近似推理，在基于属性的测试框架中特别有用，可以验证测试生成器的完整性和安全性。作者发现覆盖类型与最近提出的不正确性逻辑框架之间存在令人惊讶的联系

Method: 深入探索覆盖类型与不正确性逻辑之间的连接，识别机制来更系统地将不正确性推理集成到表达性精化类型系统中

Result: 建立了覆盖类型与不正确性逻辑的理论联系，提出了系统集成的方法

Conclusion: 这种集成为函数式程序员、程序验证器、程序分析器及相关工具提供了新的机会，能够更好地支持欠近似推理和不正确性验证

Abstract: A coverage type generalizes refinement types found in many functional
languages with support for must-style underapproximate reasoning.
Property-based testing frameworks are one particularly useful domain where such
capabilities are useful as they allow us to verify the completeness, as well as
safety, of test generators. There is a surprising connection between the kind
of underapproximate reasoning coverage types offer and the style of reasoning
enabled by recently proposed Incorrectness Logic frameworks. In our
presentation, we propose to explore this connection more deeply, identifying
mechanisms that more systematically integrate incorrectness reasoning within an
expressive refinement type system and the opportunities that such integration
offers to functional programmers, program verifiers, and program analyzers and
related tools.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 基于符号正则表达式的类型推断框架，用于组合分析功能程序中的错误行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决功能程序与效果库API交互时的错误识别问题，提供系统化的不正确性推理方法

Method: 使用符号正则表达式(SREs)表示API调用踪迹，设计新的类型推断算法进行模块化推理

Result: 推断出的类型能够证明ADT实现可能展现指定的不正确行为

Conclusion: 首个系统化的踪迹引导组合分析方法，开启了不正确性规范的下近估推理

Abstract: We present a type-theoretic framework for reasoning about incorrectness in
functional programs that interact with effectful, opaque library APIs. Our
approach centers on traces -- temporally-ordered sequences of library API
invocations -- which naturally characterize both the preconditions of
individual APIs and their composite behavior. We represent these traces using
symbolic regular expressions (SREs), enabling formal specification of incorrect
abstract data type (ADT) behaviors across function boundaries. The core
contribution is a novel type inference algorithm that operates modulo specified
incorrectness properties and leverages the symbolic finite automata (SFAs)
representations of regexes for compositional reasoning of traces. When the
algorithm succeeds, the inferred types witness that an ADT implementation can
exhibit some subset of the specified incorrect behaviors. This represents the
first systematic approach to underapproximate reasoning against trace-based
incorrectness specifications, enabling a new form of trace-guided compositional
analysis.

### [502] [LLM-based Triplet Extraction for Automated Ontology Generation in Software Engineering Standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00140)
*Songhui Yue*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的开源方法，用于从软件工程标准文档中提取关系三元组，支持自动化本体生成。该方法在三个粒度层面上都取得了与OpenIE方法相比或更优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件工程标准文档包含大量非结构化文本和领域特定术语，但传统的本体生成方法遇到挑战。关系三元组提取是自动化本体生成的关键步骤，需要更有效的方法来处理这类复杂文档。

Method: 提出了一种LLM辅助的方法，包括文档分割、候选术语挖掘、基于LLM的关系推理、术辫标准化和跨部分对齐。该方法不仅依靠提示工程，而是将LLM作为构建本体的辅助工具。

Result: 在三个不同粒度层面构建了标准测试集，对生成的本体进行评估。结果显示该方法与OpenIE三元组提取方法相比较，甚至可能更优。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种有效的开源方法，利用LLM辅助从复杂的软件工程标准文档中提取关系三元组，为自动化本体生成提供了可行的工作流程。

Abstract: Ontologies have supported knowledge representation and whitebox reasoning for
decades; thus, the automated ontology generation (AOG) plays a crucial role in
scaling their use. Software engineering standards (SES) consist of long,
unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms.
In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term
extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an
open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES.
Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study
promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an
effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term
mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section
alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed
and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show
that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple
extraction.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM4FP是首个使用大语言模型生成浮点程序的框架，专门用于触发编译器间的浮点不一致性问题，相比现有工具Varity检测到两倍多的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同编译器间的浮点计算不一致性会破坏数值软件的可靠性，需要有效的方法来检测这些不一致性问题。

Method: 结合基于语法的生成和基于反馈的变异，使用大语言模型生成多样且有效的浮点程序来触发不一致性。

Result: 在多个编译器和优化级别下，LLM4FP检测到的不一致性数量是Varity的两倍多，大多数不一致性涉及实数值差异而非极端值，且在更广泛的优化级别和主机-设备编译器间发现最多不匹配。

Conclusion: LLM引导的程序生成显著提高了数值不一致性的检测能力。

Abstract: Floating-point inconsistencies across compilers can undermine the reliability
of numerical software. We present LLM4FP, the first framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate floating-point programs specifically
designed to trigger such inconsistencies. LLM4FP combines Grammar-Based
Generation and Feedback-Based Mutation to produce diverse and valid programs.
We evaluate LLM4FP across multiple compilers and optimization levels, measuring
inconsistency rate, time cost, and program diversity. LLM4FP detects over twice
as many inconsistencies compared to the state-of-the-art tool, Varity. Notably,
most of the inconsistencies involve real-valued differences, rather than
extreme values like NaN or infinities. LLM4FP also uncovers inconsistencies
across a wider range of optimization levels, and finds the most mismatches
between host and device compilers. These results show that LLM-guided program
generation improves the detection of numerical inconsistencies.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: JS-TOD是一个用于检测JavaScript测试顺序依赖性的工具，通过随机化测试顺序来揭示测试不稳定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试顺序依赖性是测试不稳定性的主要原因之一，理想情况下每个测试应该独立运行且结果一致，但实践中测试结果会因执行顺序而变化

Method: 采用系统化方法随机化测试、测试套件和describe块的执行顺序，支持自定义重排序和重运行次数（默认每个测试和测试套件10次重排序和10次重运行）

Result: 评估发现测试顺序依赖性不稳定的两个主要原因：测试间共享文件和共享模拟状态

Conclusion: JS-TOD能够有效检测JavaScript测试中的顺序依赖性，帮助识别和解决测试不稳定问题

Abstract: We present JS-TOD (JavaScript Test Order-dependency Detector), a tool that
can extract, reorder, and rerun Jest tests to reveal possible order-dependent
test flakiness. Test order dependency is one of the leading causes of test
flakiness. Ideally, each test should operate in isolation and yield consistent
results no matter the sequence in which tests are run. However, in practice,
test outcomes can vary depending on their execution order. JS-TOD employed a
systematic approach to randomising tests, test suites, and describe blocks. The
tool is highly customisable, as one can set the number of orders and reruns
required (the default setting is 10 reorder and 10 reruns for each test and
test suite). Our evaluation using JS-TOD reveals two main causes of test order
dependency flakiness: shared files and shared mocking state between tests.

Motivation: 移动应用中bug报告是重要功能，但现有文本报告方式可能限制用户参与度。音频报告简单易用，有望增加bug报告数量，帮助开发者更快识别和修复问题

Method: 基于初步实验探讨音频bug报告的特点，分析其对现有bug复现技术的挑战

Result: 音频bug报告具有特定特征，这些特征对现有的bug复现技术构成了挑战

Conclusion: 音频bug报告有潜力增加用户参与度，但需要进一步研究其收集和分析方法，以克服现有技术面临的挑战

Abstract: Bug reporting is a key feature of mobile applications, as it enables
developers to collect information about faults that escaped testing and thus
affected end-users. This paper explores the idea of allowing end-users to
immediately report the problems that they experience by recording and
submitting audio messages. Audio recording is simple to implement and has the
potential to increase the number of bug reports that development teams can
gather, thus potentially improving the rate at which bugs are identified and
fixed. However, audio bug reports exhibit specific characteristics that
challenge existing techniques for reproducing bugs. This paper discusses these
challenges based on a preliminary experiment, and motivates further research on
the collection and analysis of audio-based bug reports

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的需求工程实践（如CrowdRE和AI辅助方法）存在脱离文化、社会和政治背景的风险，可能导致系统与真实用户需求和价值观不匹配。

Method: 基于三个社会影响案例研究，提出REConnect框架，包含建立信任关系、与利益相关者共同设计、赋权用户三大原则，以及贯穿需求获取、分析和验证的REActions实践方法。

Result: 通过案例研究表明，REConnect方法能够产生文化根基深厚、社会合法性高且在系统交付后可持续的需求。

Conclusion: 在生成式AI时代，REConnect强调必须以参与式实践指导AI集成，保护人类主体性，让人成为价值观和伦理的守护者、包容性放大器、AI输出策展人和共同反思者。

Abstract: Software increasingly shapes the infrastructures of daily life, making
requirements engineering (RE) central to ensuring that systems align with human
values and lived experiences. Yet, current popular practices such as CrowdRE
and AI-assisted elicitation strategies risk detaching requirements work from
the cultural, social, and political contexts that shape lived experiences,
human values, and real user needs. In this paper, we introduce REConnect that
re-centers RE on the human connection as central to the understanding of lived
experiences where impact is sought. REConnect advocates for a human-centered
participatory approach "that matters" to the communities and beneficiaries
involved, ensuring alignment with their values and aspirations. Drawing on
three case studies of societal impact: BloodSync in rural Nepal, Herluma
supporting women at risk of homelessness in Canada, and BridgingRoots to
revitalize Indigenous languages in the Canadian Arctic. REConnect argues that
three key principles and enablers: building trusting relationships,
co-designing with and alongside stakeholders, and empowering users as agents of
change, can yield requirements that are culturally grounded, socially
legitimate, and sustainable beyond system delivery. REConnect also proposes a
set of actionable practices (REActions) that embed relationality and ongoing
stakeholder engagement throughout requirements elicitation, analysis, and
validation of solution development. Finally, we situate REConnect in the era of
Generative AI. While AI can accelerate and scale certain RE tasks, its
integration must be guided by participatory practices that not only preserve
human agency but also empower humans' roles to become guardians of values and
ethics, inclusion amplifiers, curators of AI outputs, and co-reflectors in
iterative review cycles.

Motivation: 传统需求获取方法中，业务分析师需要手动审查访谈记录来识别和记录需求，过程耗时且容易出错。需要自动化方法来提高需求获取的效率和可靠性。

Method: 采用文本蕴含技术，利用GPT-4o模型从访谈记录中自动提取目标，构建目标模型，并进行目标细化关系分析。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在需求工程中展现出了从访谈记录自动提取目标和构建目标模型的强大能力，为自动化需求获取提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In software engineering, requirements may be acquired from stakeholders
through elicitation methods, such as interviews, observational studies, and
focus groups. When supporting acquisition from interviews, business analysts
must review transcripts to identify and document requirements. Goal modeling is
a popular technique for representing early stakeholder requirements as it lends
itself to various analyses, including refinement to map high-level goals into
software operations, and conflict and obstacle analysis. In this paper, we
describe an approach to use textual entailment to reliably extract goals from
interview transcripts and to construct goal models. The approach has been
evaluated on 15 interview transcripts across 29 application domains. The
findings show that GPT-4o can reliably extract goals from interview
transcripts, matching 62.0% of goals acquired by humans from the same
transcripts, and that GPT-4o can trace goals to originating text in the
transcript with 98.7% accuracy. In addition, when evaluated by human
annotators, GPT-4o generates goal model refinement relationships among
extracted goals with 72.2% accuracy.

TL;DR: Lin-Hunter是一个针对FPGA逻辑综合工具的测试框架，通过元形态变换规则生成结构多样化的HDL测试用例，并采用LinUCB自适应策略选择机制提高bug发现效率，在3个月实验中发现了18个独特bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FPGA逻辑综合工具测试方法过度依赖随机选择策略，导致生成的HDL测试用例结构多样性不足，无法充分探索工具的功能空间，存在未被发现的bug可能影响最终硬件实现的风险。

Method: 提出Lin-Hunter框架：1）使用元形态变换规则生成功能等效但结构多样的HDL测试用例变体；2）基于线性上置信界(LinUCB)方法集成自适应策略选择机制，根据先前测试用例的综合日志反馈动态优先选择更可能触发综合bug的变换策略。

Result: 在3个月的全面实验中，Lin-Hunter发现了18个独特bug，其中10个是先前未报告的缺陷，已得到官方开发者确认。该方法在测试用例多样性和bug发现效率方面均优于最先进的测试方法。

Conclusion: Lin-Hunter通过系统化的测试用例多样性增强和自适应策略选择，有效解决了FPGA逻辑综合工具验证中的测试输入多样性不足问题，显著提高了bug发现能力和测试效率。

Abstract: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play an indispensable role in
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), translating Register-Transfer Level (RTL)
designs into gate-level netlists. The correctness and reliability of FPGA logic
synthesis tools are critically important, as unnoticed bugs in these tools may
infect the final hardware implementations. However, recent approaches often
rely heavily on random selection strategies, limiting the structural diversity
of the generated HDL test cases and resulting in inadequate exploration of the
tool's feature space. To address this limitation, we propose Lin-Hunter, a
novel testing framework designed to systematically enhance the diversity of HDL
test cases and the efficiency of FPGA logic synthesis tool validation.
Specifically, Lin-Hunter introduces a principled set of metamorphic
transformation rules to generate functionally equivalent yet structurally
diverse HDL test case variants, effectively addressing the limited diversity of
existing test inputs. To further enhance bug discovery efficiency, Lin-Hunter
integrates an adaptive strategy selection mechanism based on the Linear Upper
Confidence Bound (LinUCB) method. This method leverages feedback from synthesis
logs of previously executed test cases to dynamically prioritize transformation
strategies that have empirically demonstrated a higher likelihood of triggering
synthesis bugs. Comprehensive experiments conducted over a three-month period
demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Lin-Hunter. Our method has
discovered 18 unique bugs, including 10 previously unreported defects, which
have been confirmed by official developers. Moreover, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art testing methods in both test-case diversity and bug-discovery
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SBOM作为保障软件供应链安全的重要工具，尽管政府强制要求使用，但相关研究仍处于早期阶段，需要了解开源项目中政策驱动SBOM的实际使用状况。

Method: 通过挖掘软件仓库研究，收集并筛选GitHub上托管的SBOM文件，使用描述性统计分析政策驱动SBOM中报告的信息及其依赖项的漏洞情况。

Result: 仅0.56%的流行GitHub仓库包含政策驱动SBOM；声明的依赖项包含2,202个独特漏洞；22%的依赖项未报告许可证信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为支持安全评估和许可证管理的SBOM使用提供了重要见解，揭示了当前SBOM实施中的安全风险和合规问题。

Abstract: Background. The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a machine-readable list
of all the software dependencies included in a software. SBOM emerged as way to
assist securing the software supply chain. However, despite mandates from
governments to use SBOM, research on this artifact is still in its early
stages. Aims. We want to understand the current state of SBOM in open-source
projects, focusing specifically on policy-driven SBOMs, i.e., SBOM created to
achieve security goals, such as enhancing project transparency and ensuring
compliance, rather than being used as fixtures for tools or artificially
generated for benchmarking or academic research purposes. Method. We performed
a mining software repository study to collect and carefully select SBOM files
hosted on GitHub. We analyzed the information reported in policy-driven SBOMs
and the vulnerabilities associated with the declared dependencies by means of
descriptive statistics. Results. We show that only 0.56% of popular GitHub
repositories contain policy-driven SBOM. The declared dependencies contain
2,202 unique vulnerabilities, while 22% of them do not report licensing
information. Conclusion. Our findings provide insights for SBOM usage to
support security assessment and licensing.

### [511] [Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294)
*Helge Spieker,Nadjib Lazaar,Arnaud Gotlieb,Nassim Belmecheri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出使用蜕变测试（MT）方法来解决多模态人类轨迹预测（HTP）系统的测试难题，通过设计五种蜕变关系来处理轨迹和环境地图输入的变换，无需依赖真实轨迹作为测试预言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类轨迹预测对自动驾驶系统安全至关重要，但由于缺乏明确的测试预言（oracle problem）以及模型的多模态随机输出特性，使得传统测试方法难以有效验证这类系统。

Method: 提出五种蜕变关系（MRs）：1）对轨迹和地图输入进行标签保持的几何变换（镜像、旋转、缩放）；2）改变语义类别标签和引入障碍物等地图变换。使用基于概率分布距离（如Wasserstein或Hellinger距离）的违反标准来评估模型输出。

Result: 开发了MT框架工具，能够在不依赖真实轨迹的情况下评估HTP模型对输入变换和环境变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 蜕变测试为解决多模态随机HTP系统的测试预言问题提供了系统化方法，有效提升了这类关键安全系统的验证可靠性。

Abstract: Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and
reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile
robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory
Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g.,
trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs
(multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary
difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future
trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This
research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic
methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem
through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic
nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both
historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an
environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric
transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and
map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2)
Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing
obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose
probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability
distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This
study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of
multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model
robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without
reliance on ground-truth trajectories.

*Zhao Tian,Junjie Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Specine是一种新颖的规范对齐技术，通过识别未对齐的输入规范、提升LLM感知的规范并进行对齐，显著提升LLM代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的技术忽视了规范感知这一关键问题，导致LLM生成的代码与编程规范持续存在不对齐问题。准确的规范感知是LLM代码生成范式的基础。

Method: 借鉴软件需求工程，提出Specine技术：识别未对齐的输入规范、提升LLM感知的规范、进行规范对齐以增强LLM代码生成性能。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的竞争基准测试中，Specine相比10个最先进的基线方法表现优异，Pass@1指标平均提升29.60%。

Conclusion: Specine通过规范对齐技术有效解决了LLM代码生成中的规范不对齐问题，显著提升了代码生成质量。

Abstract: Code generation refers to the automatic generation of source code based on a
given programming specification, which has garnered significant attention
particularly with the advancement of large language models (LLMs). However, due
to the inherent complexity of real-world problems, the LLM-generated code often
fails to fully align with the provided specification. While state-of-the-art
agent-based techniques have been proposed to enhance LLM code generation, they
overlook the critical issue of specification perception, resulting in
persistent misalignment issues. Given that accurate perception of programming
specifications serves as the foundation of the LLM-based code generation
paradigm, ensuring specification alignment is particularly crucial. In this
work, we draw on software requirements engineering to propose Specine, a novel
specification alignment technique for LLM code generation. Its key idea is to
identify misaligned input specifications, lift LLM-perceived specifications,
and align them to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs. Our
comprehensive experiments on four state-of-the-art LLMs across five challenging
competitive benchmarks by comparing with ten state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrate the effectiveness of Specine. For example, Specine outperforms the
most effective baseline, achieving an average improvement of 29.60\% across all
subjects in terms of Pass@1.

TL;DR: 一个提供SystemC虚拟原型与AFL模糊测试集成的框架，通过解合模糊器和仿真器，拦截外设访问并与模糊器协作，支持外设灵活替换和不同虚拟原型的联接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模糊测试在嵌入式软件中应用有限，现有解决方案将模糊器与内置仿真器耦合过紧，缺乏外设支持和灵活性。

Method: 设计了一个解合AFL基础模糊器与SystemC基础仿真器的框架，通过拦截外设访问并向模糊器询问值，将外设行为与模糊器联系起来。

Result: 实现了外设在仿真环境中的灵活可替换性，支持不同SystemC虚拟原型的接口，通过与多个仿真器集成和测试多种软件验证了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了嵌入式软件模糊测试中的限制，提供了一个灵活、可扩展的方案来集成模糊测试与虚拟原型仿真。

Abstract: SystemC-based virtual prototypes have emerged as widely adopted tools to test
software ahead of hardware availability, reducing the time-to-market and
improving software reliability. Recently, fuzzing has become a popular method
for automated software testing due to its ability to quickly identify
corner-case errors. However, its application to embedded software is still
limited. Simulator tools can help bridge this gap by providing a more powerful
and controlled execution environment for testing. Existing solutions, however,
often tightly couple fuzzers with built-in simulators that lack support for
hardware peripherals and of- fer limited flexibility, restricting their ability
to test embedded software. To address these limitations, we present a framework
that allows the integration of American-Fuzzy-Lop-based fuzzers and
SystemC-based simulators. The framework provides a harness to decouple the
adopted fuzzer and simulator. In addition, it intercepts peripheral accesses
and queries the fuzzer for values, effectively linking peripheral behavior to
the fuzzer. This solution enables flexible interchangeability of peripher- als
within the simulation environment and supports the interfacing of different
SystemC-based virtual prototypes. The flexibility of the pro- posed solution is
demonstrated by integrating the harness with different simulators and by
testing various softwares.

Motivation: 任务型聊天机器人测试困难，现有测试技术难以覆盖所有可能的对话场景，导致缺陷难以被发现

Method: 提出MUTABOT变异测试方法，在对话中注入故障来产生有缺陷的聊天机器人，扩展支持多个平台（Dialogflow和Rasa）

Result: 实验表明该方法能够有效揭示Botium测试生成器生成的测试套件中的弱点

Conclusion: 变异测试是评估任务型聊天机器人测试套件质量的有效方法，MUTABOT方法具有实用价值

Abstract: Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, have become ubiquitous,
offering services for a multitude of domains. Unlike general-purpose chatbots,
task-based chatbots are software designed to prioritize the completion of tasks
of the domain they handle (e.g., flight booking). Given the growing popularity
of chatbots, testing techniques that can generate full conversations as test
cases have emerged. Still, thoroughly testing all the possible conversational
scenarios implemented by a task-based chatbot is challenging, resulting in
incorrect behaviors that may remain unnoticed. To address this challenge, we
proposed MUTABOT, a mutation testing approach for injecting faults in
conversations and producing faulty chatbots that emulate defects that may
affect the conversational aspects. In this paper, we present our extension of
MUTABOT to multiple platforms (Dialogflow and Rasa), and present experiments
that show how mutation testing can be used to reveal weaknesses in test suites
generated by the Botium state-of-the-art test generator.

TL;DR: 非技术债务(NTD)是敏捷软件开发中的常见挑战，包括流程债务、社会债务、人员债务和组织债务四种形式。研究发现结构化团队、心理安全、清晰角色和有效流程对减少NTD至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非技术债务在大型敏捷软件开发环境中的影响，识别关键驱动因素及其对团队绩效的破坏作用，为企业提供实用的应对策略。

Method: 采用问卷调查、深度访谈和统计分析相结合的方法，与瑞典四家领先工业合作伙伴合作，收集了来自多样化软件专业人士的数据。

Result: 识别出五个关键发现：结构化团队学习更快；心理安全促进创新；低效流程降低满意度；远程工作导致社会碎片化；人力资源不足限制组织能力。

Conclusion: 通过优化团队组成、明确角色、培养心理安全、简化工作流程和将失败视为学习工具等策略，组织可以减少非技术债务，重获敏捷性并释放团队潜力。

Abstract: NonTechnical Debt (NTD) is a common challenge in agile software development,
manifesting in four critical forms, Process Debt, Social Debt, People Debt,
Organizational debt. NODLA project is a collaboration between Karlstad
University and four leading Swedish industrial partners, reveals how various
debt types disrupt large scale Agile Software Development (ASD) environments.
Through extensive surveys, indepth interviews, and statistical analyses
involving a diverse group of software professionals, we identified key drivers
of NTD and their impacts. Our findings emphasize (1) Well structured, highly
cohesive teams learn faster, adapt more effectively, and innovate consistently.
(2) Psychological safety, fostered by proactive leadership, is essential for
innovation, experimentation, and keeping employees. (3) Inefficient processes
and unclear roles contribute significantly to drops in job satisfaction,
productivity and team morale. (4) Social fragmentation, particularly in remote
and hybrid settings, breeds rework, delays, and increased costs. (5) Neglected
human resource needs, such as delayed hiring or insufficient training, limit an
organization ability to meet growing demands. This white paper distils these
insights into practical, evidence based strategies, such as refining team
composition, clarifying roles, fostering psychological safety, streamlining
workflows, and embracing failure as a learning tool. By implementing these
strategies, organizations can reduce NTD, reclaim agility, and unlock their
teams full potential.

TL;DR: SWRBench是一个新的自动化代码评审基准，包含1000个手动验证的GitHub Pull Requests，提供完整的项目上下文和基于LLM的客观评估方法，与人类判断高度一致（约90%）。研究发现当前ACR工具在功能错误检测方面表现更好，并提出多评审聚合策略显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化代码评审基准往往无法反映真实世界的复杂性，主要关注细粒度代码单元、缺乏完整项目上下文、使用不充分的评估指标，这阻碍了现代大型语言模型的评估。

Method: 引入SWRBench基准，包含1000个手动验证的GitHub Pull Requests，采用PR中心评审和完整项目上下文。使用基于LLM的客观评估方法，通过验证结构化真实问题是否在生成的评审中被覆盖来评估，该方法与人类判断高度一致。

Result: 对主流ACR工具和LLM的系统评估显示当前系统表现不佳，ACR工具更擅长检测功能错误。提出的简单多评审聚合策略显著提升了ACR性能，F1分数最高提升43.67%。

Conclusion: SWRBench基准、其客观评估方法、对当前ACR能力的全面研究以及有效的增强方法，为推进ACR研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Automated Code Review (ACR) is crucial for software quality, yet existing
benchmarks often fail to reflect real-world complexities, hindering the
evaluation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Current benchmarks
frequently focus on fine-grained code units, lack complete project context, and
use inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we introduce
SWRBench , a new benchmark comprising 1000 manually verified Pull Requests
(PRs) from GitHub, offering PR-centric review with full project context.
SWRBench employs an objective LLM-based evaluation method that aligns strongly
with human judgment (~90 agreement) by verifying if issues from a structured
ground truth are covered in generated reviews. Our systematic evaluation of
mainstream ACR tools and LLMs on SWRBench reveals that current systems
underperform, and ACR tools are more adept at detecting functional errors.
Subsequently, we propose and validate a simple multi-review aggregation
strategy that significantly boosts ACR performance, increasing F1 scores by up
to 43.67%. Our contributions include the SWRBench benchmark, its objective
evaluation method, a comprehensive study of current ACR capabilities, and an
effective enhancement approach, offering valuable insights for advancing ACR
research.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于大语言模型的隐私保护开发工具，能够在本地运行并为网页表单测试提供有效的字段填写建议，避免使用云端LLM带来的数据泄漏风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络应用在重要领域的普及导致对故障自由性能的高要求，而手动生成表单测试数据时间消耗大且容易出错。虽然LLM工具能够智能地处理这一任务，但使用云端模型测试机密表单存在数据泄漏和保密性风险。

Method: 开发了一个隐私保护的本地推荐工具，通过分析表单HTML结构、检测输入类型、提取字段约束条件和上下文内容，使用本地运行的大语言模型来生成合适的字段填写值。

Result: 该工具能够在不依赖云端服务的情况下，安全地为测试人员提供有效的表单字段填写建议，避免了机密数据泄漏的风险。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种解决方案，能够在保持测试效果的同时确保数据隐私安全，为测试机密网页应用提供了可靠的本地化智能测试支持。

Abstract: Web applications are increasingly used in critical domains such as education,
finance, and e-commerce. This highlights the need to ensure their failure-free
performance. One effective method for evaluating failure-free performance is
web form testing, where defining effective test scenarios is key to a complete
and accurate evaluation. A core aspect of this process involves filling form
fields with suitable values to create effective test cases. However, manually
generating these values is time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this,
various tools have been developed to assist testers. With the appearance of
large language models (LLMs), a new generation of tools seeks to handle this
task more intelligently. Although many LLM-based tools have been introduced, as
these models typically rely on cloud infrastructure, their use in testing
confidential web forms raises concerns about unintended data leakage and
breaches of confidentiality. This paper introduces a privacy-preserving
recommender that operates locally using a large language model. The tool
assists testers in web form testing by suggesting effective field values. This
tool analyzes the HTML structure of forms, detects input types, and extracts
constraints based on each field's type and contextual content, guiding proper
field filling.

TL;DR: 提出了Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC)和Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD)来解决REST API模糊测试中的三个关键挑战：认证处理、故障分类和公平比较基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REST API模糊测试存在三个主要问题：如何处理API认证、如何分类和比较不同模糊测试工具发现的故障类型、以及如何建立公平比较的案例研究基准。

Method: 开发了WFC（开源库和模式定义）用于声明式指定认证信息和分类故障类型，以及WFD（包含36个开源API的数据集）用于支持实验。使用EvoMaster等工具进行实验验证。

Result: WFC/WFD为模糊测试工具提供了统一的认证处理框架和故障分类标准，并建立了包含36个API的基准数据集，支持公平的工具比较。

Conclusion: WFC和WFD解决了REST API模糊测试的关键挑战，为研究人员提供了标准化的认证处理、故障分类和基准测试框架，有助于推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Fuzzing REST APIs is an important research problem, with practical
applications and impact in industry. As such, a lot of research work has been
carried out on this topic in the last few years. However, there are three major
issues that hinder further progress: how to deal with API authentication; how
to catalog and compare different fault types found by different fuzzers; and
what to use as case study to facilitate fair comparisons among fuzzers. To
address these important challenges, we present Web Fuzzing Commons (WFC) and
Web Fuzzing Dataset (WFD). WFC is a set of open-source libraries and schema
definitions to declaratively specify authentication info and catalog different
types of faults that fuzzers can automatically detect. WFD is a collection of
36 open-source APIs with all necessary scaffolding to easily run experiments
with fuzzers, supported by WFC. To show the usefulness of WFC/WFD, a set of
experiments is carried out with EvoMaster, a state-of-the-art fuzzer for Web
APIs. However, any fuzzer can benefit from WFC and WFD. We compare EvoMaster
with other state-of-the-art tools such as ARAT-RL, EmRest, LLamaRestTest,
RESTler, and Schemathesis. We discuss common pitfalls in tool comparisons, as
well as providing guidelines with support of WFC/WFD to avoid them.

TL;DR: BLAST是一个结合LLM和基于搜索的软件测试(SBST)的工具，能够从问题-补丁对自动生成问题重现测试，在基准测试中达到35.4%的成功率，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者经常提交没有相应测试的补丁，使得问题重现测试的自动生成成为重要研究方向，以增强开发者对问题已解决的信心。

Method: 结合LLM和SBST：通过git历史分析、静态分析和SBST生成测试来提取相关上下文；使用LLM生成种子测试，然后通过SBST优化生成最终测试。

Result: 在426个Python问题中成功生成151个测试(35.4%)，优于现有技术(23.5%)；在实际部署中，32个PR-问题对中有11个成功生成测试。

Conclusion: BLAST展示了在实际开发环境中自动生成问题重现测试的可行性，为研究者和工具开发者提供了有价值的见解和机会。

Abstract: Issue-reproducing tests fail on buggy code and pass once a patch is applied,
thus increasing developers' confidence that the issue has been resolved and
will not be re-introduced. However, past research has shown that developers
often commit patches without such tests, making the automated generation of
issue-reproducing tests an area of interest. We propose BLAST, a tool for
automatically generating issue-reproducing tests from issue-patch pairs by
combining LLMs and search-based software testing (SBST). For the LLM part, we
complement the issue description and the patch by extracting relevant context
through git history analysis, static analysis, and SBST-generated tests. For
the SBST part, we adapt SBST for generating issue-reproducing tests; the issue
description and the patch are fed into the SBST optimization through an
intermediate LLM-generated seed, which we deserialize into SBST-compatible
form. BLAST successfully generates issue-reproducing tests for 151/426 (35.4%)
of the issues from a curated Python benchmark, outperforming the
state-of-the-art (23.5%). Additionally, to measure the real-world impact of
BLAST, we built a GitHub bot that runs BLAST whenever a new pull request (PR)
linked to an issue is opened, and if BLAST generates an issue-reproducing test,
the bot proposes it as a comment in the PR. We deployed the bot in three
open-source repositories for three months, gathering data from 32 PRs-issue
pairs. BLAST generated an issue-reproducing test in 11 of these cases, which we
proposed to the developers. By analyzing the developers' feedback, we discuss
challenges and opportunities for researchers and tool builders. Data and

TL;DR: Tether是一个基于LLM的桌面应用，专门为ADHD软件工程师设计，通过实时活动监控、RAG技术和游戏化机制提供个性化的专注力支持和对话辅助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件工程领域的公平性、多样性和包容性往往忽视神经多样性，特别是ADHD开发者的认知挑战（如持续注意力、任务启动、自我调节），缺乏专门支持他们工作流程的工具。

Method: 结合本地活动监控、检索增强生成（RAG）和游戏化技术，开发了一个LLM驱动的桌面应用，通过操作系统级系统跟踪来提示参与度，并利用ADHD特定资源提供相关响应。

Result: 通过自我使用的初步验证显示，经过迭代提示优化和RAG增强后，上下文准确性得到改善。系统能够适应软件特定的工作流程和ADHD相关挑战。

Conclusion: Tether为未来神经多样性感知工具奠定了基础，展示了LLM作为个性化支持系统满足代表性不足认知需求的潜力，尽管尚未经过目标用户评估。

Abstract: Equity, diversity, and inclusion in software engineering often overlook
neurodiversity, particularly the experiences of developers with Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Despite the growing awareness about that
population in SE, few tools are designed to support their cognitive challenges
(e.g., sustained attention, task initiation, self-regulation) within
development workflows. We present Tether, an LLM-powered desktop application
designed to support software engineers with ADHD by delivering adaptive,
context-aware assistance. Drawing from engineering research methodology, Tether
combines local activity monitoring, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and
gamification to offer real-time focus support and personalized dialogue. The
system integrates operating system level system tracking to prompt engagement
and its chatbot leverages ADHD-specific resources to offer relevant responses.
Preliminary validation through self-use revealed improved contextual accuracy
following iterative prompt refinements and RAG enhancements. Tether
differentiates itself from generic tools by being adaptable and aligned with
software-specific workflows and ADHD-related challenges. While not yet
evaluated by target users, this work lays the foundation for future
neurodiversity-aware tools in SE and highlights the potential of LLMs as
personalized support systems for underrepresented cognitive needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在自动化C程序修复中的潜力，将统计程序分析与LLM推理能力相结合，以改进现有的自动程序修复方法。

Method: 开发了一个集成框架，包含频谱故障定位(SBFL)、运行时反馈和结构化思维链(CoT)提示的自主修复循环。采用迭代修复机制，模型基于失败测试、可疑代码区域和先前补丁结果进行推理，生成新的候选补丁。

Result: 在Codeflaws基准测试的3,902个bug上实现了44.93%的修复准确率，相比GPT-4 with CoT等先进基线方法有3.61%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了将统计程序分析与生成式AI在自动化调试中结合的实际可行路径，通过迭代推理和反馈机制有效减少了重复错误并提高了修复效率。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates
spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and
Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis
with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing
tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new
candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the
results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent
modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain
unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where
our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute
improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT.
This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical
program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.

TL;DR: 提出ProbTest方法，基于优惠券收集问题理论，自动确定概率程序测试所需执行次数，为测试结果提供统计保证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率程序由于随机性需要重复测试，但传统方法难以确定合适的测试执行次数，导致测试效率低下且结果不可靠

Method: 基于优惠券收集问题理论的黑盒单元测试方法，通过PyTest插件自动处理测试执行次数，开发者无需额外编写测试代码

Result: 在Gymnasium强化学习库和随机化数据结构案例研究中验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: ProbTest为概率程序测试提供了统计保证的自动化解决方案，显著提高了测试效率和可靠性

Abstract: Testing probabilistic programs is non-trivial due to their stochastic nature.
Given an input, the program may produce different outcomes depending on the
underlying stochastic choices in the program. This means testing the expected
outcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike
deterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test
input. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a
probabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel
black-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of
probabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a
well-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this
method, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the
number of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical
guarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a
well-known unit testing tool for python programs. Using this plug-in,
developers can write unit tests similar to any other Python program and the
necessary test executions are handled automatically. We evaluate the method on
case studies from the Gymnasium reinforcement learning library and a randomized
data structure.

thread-safe is a challenging task. This paper presents a highly scalable method
to analyze thread-safety in Java classes. We provide a definition of
thread-safety for Java classes founded on the correctness principle of the Java
memory model, data race freedom. We devise a set of properties for Java classes
that are proven to ensure thread-safety. We encode these properties in the
static analysis tool CodeQL to automatically analyze Java source code. We
perform an evaluation on the top 1000 GitHub repositories. The evaluation
comprises 3632865 Java classes; with 1992 classes annotated as @ThreadSafe from
71 repositories. These repositories include highly popular software such as
Apache Flink (24.6k stars), Facebook Fresco (17.1k stars), PrestoDB (16.2k
starts), and gRPC (11.6k starts). Our queries detected thousands of
thread-safety errors. The running time of our queries is below 2 minutes for
repositories up to 200k lines of code, 20k methods, 6000 fields, and 1200
classes. We have submitted a selection of detected concurrency errors as PRs,
and developers positively reacted to these PRs. We have submitted our CodeQL
queries to the main CodeQL repository, and they are currently in the process of
becoming available as part of GitHub actions. The results demonstrate the
applicability and scalability of our method to analyze thread-safety in
real-world code bases.

Motivation: 顺序决策模型在安全关键应用中容易学习不安全行为，现有测试框架难以发现多样化的崩溃触发场景，需要开发有效的测试方法。

Conclusion: CureFuzz是测试顺序决策模型和优化其性能的有价值工具，能够有效识别多样化的安全风险场景。

Abstract: Sequential decision-making processes (SDPs) are fundamental for complex
real-world challenges, such as autonomous driving, robotic control, and traffic
management. While recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) have led to mature
solutions for solving these complex problems, SDMs remain vulnerable to
learning unsafe behaviors, posing significant risks in safety-critical
applications. However, developing a testing framework for SDMs that can
identify a diverse set of crash-triggering scenarios remains an open challenge.
To address this, we propose CureFuzz, a novel curiosity-driven black-box fuzz
testing approach for SDMs. CureFuzz proposes a curiosity mechanism that allows
a fuzzer to effectively explore novel and diverse scenarios, leading to
improved detection of crashtriggering scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a
multi-objective seed selection technique to balance the exploration of novel
scenarios and the generation of crash-triggering scenarios, thereby optimizing
the fuzzing process. We evaluate CureFuzz on various SDMs and experimental
results demonstrate that CureFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a
substantial margin in the total number of faults and distinct types of
crash-triggering scenarios. We also demonstrate that the crash-triggering
scenarios found by CureFuzz can repair SDMs, highlighting CureFuzz as a
valuable tool for testing SDMs and optimizing their performance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉数据且内存需求大，缺乏标准化格式导致场景可移植性差，需要从文本事故报告中生成标准化测试场景来改善自动驾驶系统测试。

Method: 使用LLM将文本事故报告转换为OpenSCENARIO文件，通过场景解构、场景块变异和场景重组生成基于推导的场景文件树。

Result: 成功生成33个场景文件树共4,373个场景文件，有效检测了Autoware在安全性、智能性和平滑性方面的异常行为。

Conclusion: Txt2Sce能够有效从文本报告生成标准化测试场景，提高场景多样性，并成功识别自动驾驶系统的缺陷行为。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning and related technologies,
Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) have made significant progress and are
gradually being widely applied in safety-critical fields. However, numerous
accident reports show that ADSs still encounter challenges in complex
scenarios. As a result, scenario-based testing has become essential for
identifying defects and ensuring reliable performance. In particular,
real-world accident reports offer valuable high-risk scenarios for more
targeted ADS testing. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on
visual data, which demands large memory and manual annotation. Additionally,
since existing methods do not adopt standardized scenario formats (e.g.,
OpenSCENARIO), the generated scenarios are often tied to specific platforms and
ADS implementations, limiting their scalability and portability. To address
these challenges, we propose Txt2Sce, a method for generating test scenarios in
OpenSCENARIO format based on textual accident reports. Txt2Sce first uses a LLM
to convert textual accident reports into corresponding OpenSCENARIO scenario
files. It then generates a derivation-based scenario file tree through scenario
disassembly, scenario block mutation, and scenario assembly. By utilizing the
derivation relationships between nodes in the scenario tree, Txt2Sce helps
developers identify the scenario conditions that trigger unexpected behaviors
of ADSs. In the experiments, we employ Txt2Sce to generate 33 scenario file
trees, resulting in a total of 4,373 scenario files for testing the open-source
ADS, Autoware. The experimental results show that Txt2Sce successfully converts
textual reports into valid OpenSCENARIO files, enhances scenario diversity
through mutation, and effectively detects unexpected behaviors of Autoware in
terms of safety, smartness, and smoothness.

Motivation: 随着自动化系统的发展，需要新的安全评估框架来证明系统在真实条件下不会带来不可接受的风险。操作设计域(ODD)的形式化是关键挑战，需要在保持规范格式灵活性的同时确保一致性和可追溯性。

Method: 使用Pkl语言对ODD进行形式化规范，利用专用配置语言的特性来改进可用性，并通过汽车行业的示例进行说明。

Result: 开发了一种能够解决ODD规范核心挑战的方法，提高了规范的一致性和可追溯性，同时保持了格式的灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的Pkl语言形式化方法可以有效支持ODD的规范制定，确保对操作环境进行严格评估，该方法虽然以汽车行业为例，但具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The deployment of automated functions that can operate without direct human
supervision has changed safety evaluation in domains seeking higher levels of
automation. Unlike conventional systems that rely on human operators, these
functions require new assessment frameworks to demonstrate that they do not
introduce unacceptable risks under real-world conditions. To make a convincing
safety claim, the developer must present a thorough justification argument,
supported by evidence, that a function is free from unreasonable risk when
operated in its intended context. The key concept relevant to the presented
work is the intended context, often captured by an Operational Design Domain
specification (ODD). ODD formalization is challenging due to the need to
maintain flexibility in adopting diverse specification formats while preserving
consistency and traceability and integrating seamlessly into the development,
validation, and assessment. This paper presents a way to formalize an ODD in
the Pkl language, addressing central challenges in specifying ODDs while
improving usability through specialized configuration language features. The
approach is illustrated with an automotive example but can be broadly applied
to ensure rigorous assessments of operational contexts.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效评估测试环境对特定测试用例的适用性，支持CCAM系统的自动化安全评估

Abstract: The emergence of Connected, Cooperative, and Automated Mobility (CCAM)
systems has significantly transformed the safety assessment landscape. Because
they integrate automated vehicle functions beyond those managed by a human
driver, new methods are required to evaluate their safety. Approaches that
compile evidence from multiple test environments have been proposed for
type-approval and similar evaluations, emphasizing scenario coverage within the
systems Operational Design Domain (ODD). However, aligning diverse test
environment requirements with distinct testing capabilities remains
challenging. This paper presents a method for evaluating the suitability of
test case allocation to various test environments by drawing on and extending
an existing ODD formalization with key testing attributes. The resulting
construct integrates ODD parameters and additional test attributes to capture a
given test environments relevant capabilities. This approach supports automatic
suitability evaluation and is demonstrated through a case study on an automated
reversing truck function. The system's implementation fidelity is tied to ODD
parameters, facilitating automated test case allocation based on each
environments capacity for object-detection sensor assessment.

Motivation: 现有代码修复方法存在训练成本高或推理计算昂贵的问题，传统检索策略无法捕捉代码结构细节，导致检索质量不佳

Method: 提出算法感知检索策略（基于算法类型预测缩小搜索空间）和模块化双编码器架构（分别处理代码和文本输入，实现细粒度语义匹配），并构建RACodeBench真实世界基准

Result: 在RACodeBench和竞争性编程数据集上实验表明，ReCode以显著降低的推理成本实现了更高的修复准确率

Conclusion: ReCode框架为现实世界代码修复场景提供了实用价值，展示了检索增强生成在代码相关任务中的有效性

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated
program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches
for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive
inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context
learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional
retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings,
fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal
retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a
fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for
accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key
innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search
space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular
dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs,
enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts.
Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from
real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of
synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on
RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode
achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost,
highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于bootstrap的新方法，用于检测统计推断中高斯极限理论的假设违反问题，该方法简单有效且无预检验偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典高斯极限理论的假设违反经常导致不可靠的统计推断，需要开发能够检测这种违反的有效方法。

Method: 通过测量bootstrap统计量的条件分布与极限高斯分布之间的差异来评估模型设定有效性，该方法计算简单，只需基于bootstrap统计量的i.i.d.样本测量分布差异。

Result: 提出了满足无预检验偏差、广泛适用性和对非正态偏离一致性的检验方法，并在五种常见高斯近似失效场景中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测统计推断中的假设违反提供了简单有效的诊断工具，具有广泛的实际应用价值，特别是在宏观经济实证研究中。

Abstract: Violation of the assumptions underlying classical (Gaussian) limit theory
frequently leads to unreliable statistical inference. This paper shows the
novel result that the bootstrap can detect such violation by means of simple
and powerful tests which (a) induce no pre-testing bias, (b) can be performed
using the same critical values in a broad range of applications, and (c) are
consistent against deviations from asymptotic normality. By focusing on the
discrepancy between the conditional distribution of a bootstrap statistic and
the (limiting) Gaussian distribution which obtains under valid specification,
we show how to assess whether this discrepancy is large enough to indicate
specification invalidity. The method, which is computationally straightforward,
only requires to measure the discrepancy between the bootstrap and the Gaussian
distributions based on a sample of i.i.d. draws of the bootstrap statistic. We
derive sufficient conditions for the randomness in the data to mix with the
randomness in the bootstrap repetitions in a way such that (a), (b) and (c)
above hold. To demonstrate the practical relevance and broad applicability of
our diagnostic procedure, we discuss five scenarios where the asymptotic
Gaussian approximation may fail: (i) weak instruments in instrumental variable
regression; (ii) non-stationarity in autoregressive time series; (iii)
parameters near or at the boundary of the parameter space; (iv) infinite
variance innovations in a location model for i.i.d. data; (v) invalidity of the
delta method due to (near-)rank deficiency in the implied Jacobian matrix. An
illustration drawn from the empirical macroeconomic literature concludes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融和经济领域的计数数据通常具有异方差性和稀疏性特征，而常用的泊松回归方法在这些条件下可能表现不佳，需要更灵活的估计框架。

Method: 提出了一个包含泊松回归在内的广义矩估计器类别，通过简单的交叉验证程序来选择最优估计器，以平衡偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 数值模拟和公司金融数据应用表明，最优估计方法在不同设置下差异很大，通常偏离泊松回归，验证了灵活估计框架的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在处理具有异方差性和稀疏性的计数数据时，需要采用更灵活的估计方法而非单一依赖泊松回归，提出的框架能够根据数据特征自适应选择最优估计器。

Abstract: We show that Poisson regression, though often recommended over log-linear
regression for modeling count and other non-negative variables in finance and
economics, can be far from optimal when heteroskedasticity and sparsity -- two
common features of such data -- are both present. We propose a general class of
moment estimators, encompassing Poisson regression, that balances the
bias-variance trade-off under these conditions. A simple cross-validation
procedure selects the optimal estimator. Numerical simulations and applications
to corporate finance data reveal that the best choice varies substantially
across settings and often departs from Poisson regression, underscoring the
need for a more flexible estimation framework.

TL;DR: 本文通过凸锥优化框架重新审视多项Logit、嵌套Logit和树嵌套Logit模型的参数估计，提出将最大似然估计问题转化为指数锥规划问题的新方法，相比传统梯度方法具有更好的鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的最大似然估计方法对步长选择和初始化敏感，收敛速度慢且不稳定，需要更鲁棒可靠的估计方法。

Method: 将MNL模型转化为等效的指数锥规划问题；对于NL和TNL模型，当相异参数固定时，证明估计问题是凸的并可简化为ECP；设计两阶段程序：外循环更新尺度参数，内循环用内点法求解ECP更新效用系数。

Result: 大量实验表明，锥优化方法获得了更好的MLE解、对初始化更强的鲁棒性，相比标准梯度方法实现了显著加速，特别是在具有高维规格和大选择集的大规模实例上。

Conclusion: 指数锥规划为估计广泛类别的离散选择模型提供了实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit parameter estimation for multinomial logit (MNL),
nested logit (NL), and tree-nested logit (TNL) models through the framework of
convex conic optimization. Traditional approaches typically solve the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using gradient-based methods, which are
sensitive to step-size selection and initialization, and may therefore suffer
from slow or unstable convergence. In contrast, we propose a novel estimation
strategy that reformulates these models as conic optimization problems,
enabling more robust and reliable estimation procedures. Specifically, we show
that the MLE for MNL admits an equivalent exponential cone program (ECP). For
NL and TNL, we prove that when the dissimilarity (scale) parameters are fixed,
the estimation problem is convex and likewise reducible to an ECP. Leveraging
these results, we design a two-stage procedure: an outer loop that updates the
scale parameters and an inner loop that solves the ECP to update the utility
coefficients. The inner problems are handled by interior-point methods with
iteration counts that grow only logarithmically in the target accuracy, as
implemented in off-the-shelf solvers (e.g., MOSEK). Extensive experiments
across estimation instances of varying size show that our conic approach
attains better MLE solutions, greater robustness to initialization, and
substantial speedups compared to standard gradient-based MLE, particularly on
large-scale instances with high-dimensional specifications and large choice
sets. Our findings establish exponential cone programming as a practical and
scalable alternative for estimating a broad class of discrete choice models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统递归Logit模型会给网络中所有路径分配非零概率，包括那些不现实的路径（如超过旅行时间限制或违反能量约束的路径），这限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 通过扩展状态空间将可行性约束纳入递归Logit框架，恢复马尔可夫性质，使用标准值迭代方法进行估计。证明了在正离散成本下估计方法的唯一解存在性。

Result: 在合成和真实网络上的实验表明，CRL模型提高了行为真实性和估计稳定性，特别是在循环网络中表现更好。

Conclusion: CRL模型成功解决了传统RL模型的局限性，在保持不依赖路径采样和易于预测等优势的同时，系统性地从通用选择集中排除不可行路径。

Abstract: The recursive logit (RL) model has become a widely used framework for route
choice modeling, but it suffers from a key limitation: it assigns nonzero
probabilities to all paths in the network, including those that are
unrealistic, such as routes exceeding travel time deadlines or violating energy
constraints. To address this gap, we propose a novel Constrained Recursive
Logit (CRL) model that explicitly incorporates feasibility constraints into the
RL framework. CRL retains the main advantages of RL-no path sampling and ease
of prediction-but systematically excludes infeasible paths from the universal
choice set. The model is inherently non-Markovian; to address this, we develop
a tractable estimation approach based on extending the state space, which
restores the Markov property and enables estimation using standard value
iteration methods. We prove that our estimation method admits a unique solution
under positive discrete costs and establish its equivalence to a multinomial
logit model defined over restricted universal path choice sets. Empirical
experiments on synthetic and real networks demonstrate that CRL improves
behavioral realism and estimation stability, particularly in cyclic networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于聚合事件研究系数的鲁棒推断方法可能产生误导，因为处理前后系数来自不同的队列组成，且未处理对照组随时间变化。

Method: 在队列-时期层面工作，引入"块偏差"概念，建立可逆分解将估计器偏差与块偏差联系起来，允许研究者对块偏差施加透明限制。

Result: 模拟显示当平行趋势违反在不同队列间存在差异时，该框架产生更集中的置信区间；在最低工资对青少年就业影响的应用中，该方法显示稳健的负效应。

Conclusion: 该框架在存在多个队列、足够的队列内精度和显著的跨队列异质性时最为有用，提供了比聚合方法更可靠的推断结果。

Abstract: I propose a cohort-anchored framework for robust inference in event studies
with staggered adoption. Robust inference based on aggregated event-study
coefficients, as in Rambachan and Roth (2023), can be misleading because pre-
and post-treatment coefficients are identified from different cohort
compositions and the not-yet-treated control group changes over time. To
address these issues, I work at the cohort-period level and introduce the
\textit{block bias}-the parallel-trends violation for a cohort relative to its
anchored initial control group-whose interpretation is consistent across pre-
and post-treatment periods. For both the imputation estimator and the estimator
in Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) that uses not-yet-treated units as controls, I
show an invertible decomposition linking these estimators' biases in
post-treatment periods to block biases. This allows researchers to place
transparent restrictions on block biases (e.g., Relative Magnitudes and Second
Differences) and conduct robust inference using the algorithm from Rambachan
and Roth (2023). In simulations, when parallel-trends violations differ across
cohorts, my framework yields better-centered (and sometimes narrower)
confidence sets than the aggregated approach. In a reanalysis of the effect of
minimum-wage changes on teen employment in the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)
application, my inference framework with the Second Differences restriction
yields confidence sets centered well below zero, indicating robust negative
effects, whereas inference based on aggregated coefficients yields sets
centered near zero. The proposed framework is most useful when there are
several cohorts, adequate within-cohort precision, and substantial cross-cohort
heterogeneity.

Motivation: 观察性研究中的设计阶段通过选择平衡协变量的子样本来改善处理组和对照组的可比性，但这一做法的理论依据尚不明确，需要系统性的论证

Method: 将设计阶段形式化为通过子样本选择进行估计量调整的过程，证明协变量平衡是合理的子样本选择标准，并展示协变量不平衡可作为回归分析中的敏感性度量

Result: 协变量平衡程度决定了子样本能够容忍的最大模型设定错误程度，平衡的子样本能够识别出对模型设定错误更不敏感的估计量

Conclusion: 设计阶段追求平衡子样本的本质是识别对模型设定错误具有更强鲁棒性的估计量，协变量不平衡可作为敏感性度量来促进研究者与读者之间的沟通

Abstract: The "design phase" refers to a stage in observational studies, during which a
researcher constructs a subsample that achieves a better balance in covariate
distributions between the treated and untreated units. In this paper, we study
the role of this preliminary phase in the context of linear regression,
offering a justification for its utility. To that end, we first formalize the
design phase as a process of estimand adjustment via selecting a subsample.
Then, we show that covariate balance of a subsample is indeed a justifiable
criterion for guiding the selection: it informs on the maximum degree of model
misspecification that can be allowed for a subsample, when a researcher wishes
to restrict the bias of the estimand for the parameter of interest within a
target level of precision. In this sense, the pursuit of a balanced subsample
in the design phase is interpreted as identifying an estimand that is less
susceptible to bias in the presence of model misspecification. Also, we
demonstrate that covariate imbalance can serve as a sensitivity measure in
regression analysis, and illustrate how it can structure a communication
between a researcher and the readers of her report.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统回顾和荟萃分析发现，工具变量(IV)研究中有61%存在解释性错误，研究者错误地将局部平均处理效应(LATE)解释为其他因果参数，影响了研究结论的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具变量常用于观察性研究和非依从性实验中的因果效应识别，但研究者往往将LATE错误解释为原始研究问题对应的因果参数，这种解释性错误可能导致结论无效。

Method: 对经济学、政治学、流行病学和临床医学领域顶级期刊发表的309项独特研究进行系统回顾和荟萃分析，评估工具变量应用的实用主义模式和解释性错误。

Result: 研究发现大部分研究虽然针对LATE，但很少真正关注这一参数本身。其中61%的研究包含错误解释，将LATE误认为其他可能数值不同甚至符号相反的参数。

Conclusion: 工具变量应用得出的结论有效性经常受到解释性错误的损害，需要更谨慎地解释LATE估计结果，避免将其错误等同于原始研究目标参数。

Abstract: Instrumental variables (IV) are often used to identify causal effects in
observational settings and experiments subject to non-compliance. Under
canonical assumptions, IVs allow us to identify a so-called local average
treatment effect (LATE). The use of IVs is often accompanied by a pragmatic
decision to abandon the identification of the causal parameter that corresponds
to the original research question and target the LATE instead. This pragmatic
decision presents a potential source of error: an investigator mistakenly
interprets findings as if they had made inference on their original causal
parameter of interest. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
patterns of pragmatism and interpretational errors in the applied IV literature
published in leading journals of economics, political science, epidemiology,
and clinical medicine (n = 309 unique studies). We found that a large fraction
of studies targeted the LATE, although specific interest in this parameter was
rare. Of these studies, 61% contained claims that mistakenly suggested that
another parameter was targeted -- one whose value likely differs, and could
even have the opposite sign, from the parameter actually estimated. Our
findings suggest that the validity of conclusions drawn from IV applications is
often compromised by interpretational errors.

Result: 协调后的研究预测显示2100年GDP损失范围更窄且更低，但美国特定的温室气体社会成本仍高于当前列举模型的市场损害估计。联合估计进一步揭示了综合影响的严重性。

Conclusion: 需要更多研究市场和非市场气候影响，包括相互作用和国际溢出效应。宏观经济和列举方法结果的整合研究将增强两种文献对气候政策分析的有用性。

Abstract: This paper synthesizes evidence on climate change impacts specific to U.S.
populations. We develop an apples-to-apples comparison of econometric studies
that empirically estimate the relationship between climate change and gross
domestic product (GDP). We demonstrate that with harmonized probabilistic
socioeconomic and climate inputs these papers project a narrower and lower
range of 2100 GDP losses than what is reported across the published studies,
yet the implied U.S.-specific social cost of greenhouse gases (SC-GHG) is still
greater than the market-based damage estimates in current enumerative models.
We then integrate evidence on nonmarket damages with the GDP impacts and
recover a jointly-estimated SC-GHG. Our findings highlight the need for more
research on both market and nonmarket climate impacts, including interaction
and international spillover impacts. Further investigation of how results of
macroeconomic and enumerative approaches can be integrated would enhance the
usefulness of both strands of literature to climate policy analysis going
forward.

### [538] [Exploring Trade Openness and Logistics Efficiency in the G20 Economies: A Bootstrap ARDL Analysis of Growth Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00368)
*Haibo Wang,Lutfu Sua*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本研究使用Bootstrap ARDL-ECM模型分析G20国家贸易开放度、物流绩效与经济增长的关系，发现物流效率（特别是海关管理、基础设施和运输可靠性）对国际贸易和经济增长具有关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G20作为世界主要经济体联盟，在物流效率和贸易开放度方面存在显著差异，为比较分析提供了良好背景。研究旨在为政策制定者提供通过基础设施投资和监管改革来提升贸易竞争力和经济发展的依据。

Method: 采用Bootstrap自回归分布滞后(ARDL)模型结合动态误差修正机制(ECM)，使用世界银行物流绩效指数(LPI)2007-2023年数据，量化贸易便利化和物流基础设施对经济增长的短期和长期影响。

Result: 研究结果强调了高效物流（特别是海关管理、物理基础设施和运输可靠性）在推动国际贸易和促进持续经济增长中的关键作用。这些领域的改进能显著提升国家的贸易能力和整体经济表现。

Conclusion: 物流绩效对经济增长具有重要影响，政策制定者应通过有针对性的基础设施投资和监管改革来提升贸易便利化水平，从而促进经济可持续发展。

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between trade openness, logistics
performance, and economic growth within G20 economies. Using a Bootstrap
Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model augmented by a dynamic error
correction mechanism (ECM), the analysis quantifies both short run and long run
effects of trade facilitation and logistics infrastructure, measured via the
World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) from 2007 to 2023, on economic
growth. The G20, as a consortium of the world's leading economies, exhibits
significant variation in logistics efficiency and degrees of trade openness,
providing a robust context for comparative analysis. The ARDL-ECM approach,
reinforced by bootstrap resampling, delivers reliable estimates even in the
presence of small samples and complex variable linkages. Findings are intended
to inform policymakers seeking to enhance trade competitiveness and economic
development through targeted investment in infrastructure and regulatory
reforms supporting trade facilitation. The results underscore the critical role
of efficient logistics specifically customs administration, physical
infrastructure, and shipment reliability in driving international trade and
fostering sustained economic growth. Improvements in these areas can
substantially increase a country's trade capacity and overall economic
performance.

*Shujiang Cao,Shutao Cao*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 加拿大数据显示，总生产率与高收入者收入份额呈强正相关。研究发现2003-2015年生产率下降完全由顶尖工人质量下降导致，而非技术退步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到加拿大总生产率与高收入者收入份额的正相关性，以及2000年代初以来的生产率放缓现象，研究旨在探讨顶尖工人和企业匹配在生产率放缓中的作用。

Method: 估计2003-2015年加拿大企业的全要素生产率，考虑顶尖工人与非顶尖工人之间的分类匹配，将测量生产率分解为希克斯中性技术和顶尖工人质量两部分。

Result: 测量总生产率确实下降，但下降完全由顶尖工人质量下降导致，而希克斯中性技术实际上有所改善。企业内部变化和企业间重新分配都对顶尖工人质量下降有重要贡献。

Conclusion: 生产率放缓主要源于顶尖工人质量的下降，而非技术退步。顶尖人才流失等可能是导致顶尖工人质量下降的原因。

Abstract: Measured aggregate productivity and the income share of top earners are
strongly and positively correlated in the Canadian data. Productivity slowdown
since the early 2000s was accompanied with a flattening income share of top
earners. Motivated by these facts, we study the role of firms' top-paid workers
and worker matching in accounting for the slowdown of measured total factor
productivity. We first estimate total factor productivity for Canadian firms in
the period of 2003-2015, taking into account the assortative matching between
top workers and non-top workers. Measured total factor productivity consists of
the Hicks-neutral technology and the quality of top workers. Our estimation
suggests that measured aggregate total factor productivity declined from 2003
to 2015, in line with that estimated by the statistical agency. The decline of
measured productivity is entirely accounted for by the declining quality of top
workers, while the Hicks-neutral technology improved. Both the within-firm
changes and the cross-firm reallocation of top-worker quality are important in
contributing to the decline of overall top-worker quality. We also discuss
possible causes of declines in the quality of top workers, e.g., the emigration
of top talents as studied in recent literature.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于趋势的定性分析框架，用于在信息严重受限条件下分析谣言对复杂投资决策的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息严重受限的环境中，谣言对复杂投资决策产生重要影响，但现有方法缺乏有效的分析工具来处理这种不确定性。

Method: 使用基于趋势的模型，仅需增加、减少或恒定关系等最小数据输入。通过趋势规则集生成场景，允许的场景转换形成有向图来表示系统随时间的行为。

Result: 开发了三个相互关联的模型：金融复杂投资决策模型、谣言传播动态模型以及两者的集成模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为在信息受限环境下分析谣言对投资决策的影响提供了一种有效的定性分析方法，能够处理不确定性并生成系统行为的时间演化表示。

Abstract: This paper develops a qualitative framework for analysing the impact of
rumours on complex investment decisions (CID) under severe information
constraints. The proposed trend-based models rely on minimal data inputs in the
form of increasing, decreasing, or constant relations. Sets of trend rules
generate scenarios, and permitted transitions between them form a directed
graph that represents system behaviour over time. The approach is applied in
three interconnected models: financial CID, rumour-spreading dynamics, and
their integration.

TL;DR: 提出了未来准备指数（IFR）框架，用于评估国家在持续加速变化环境中的承受、适应和繁荣能力，整合了经济韧性和适应能力两个关键维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试工具无法充分应对系统性波动时代的需求，需要一个新的框架来评估国家面对临时冲击和结构性变化的整体准备程度。

Method: 基于Lucas的经济理论区分和Jawad的GBC模型，采用全社会视角，评估政府、企业和公民三个主体在六个基础维度的准备情况。

Result: IFR框架能够提供可操作的见解，支持部门性和主题性分析，成为指导国家发展的动态政策相关工具。

Conclusion: IFR作为一个综合性评估工具，为政策制定者提供了在系统性波动时代指导国家发展的有效方法，强调了韧性和适应能力的同等重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Index of Future Readiness (IFR), a novel framework
for assessing a country's capacity to withstand, adapt to, and prosper within
an environment of continuous and accelerating change. The framework builds on
the classical distinction, first emphasized in economic discourse by Robert E.
Lucas Jr. in the 1970s, between temporary shocks, which call for economic
resilience, and permanent shocks, which require adaptive capacity. The IFR
applies a whole-of-society perspective, drawing on Ali Qassim Jawad s GBC
model, to evaluate the preparedness of three central actors (government,
businesses, and citizens) across six foundational dimensions. Unlike
conventional benchmarking instruments, the IFR explicitly integrates both
resilience, understood as the ability to bounce back from temporary shocks, and
adaptive capacity, conceived as the ability to bounce forward in the face of
structural or permanent disturbances. By enabling both sectoral and thematic
analysis, the IFR provides policymakers with actionable insights and thus
serves as a dynamic, policy-relevant tool for guiding national development in
an era of systemic volatility.

TL;DR: 论文比较了古诺双寡头中的两种产业组织模式：利润最大化与奖金竞争，发现两种模式转换会产生看似矛盾的结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究古典利润最大化模式与奖金竞争模式在古诺双寡头中的不同表现，解释两种模式转换时出现的悖论现象

Method: 使用古诺模型的两个版本进行分析：同质商品模型和差异化商品模型

Result: 从利润最大化转向奖金竞争会导致完全竞争和零利润（谢弗悖论）；从奖金竞争转向利润最大化则导致产量大幅下降，这与竞争提高效率的常识相悖

Conclusion: 两种产业组织模式的转换会产生反直觉的经济结果，需要在不同商品类型的古诺模型中重新审视竞争与效率的关系

Abstract: The paper compares two types of industrial organization in the Cournot
duopoly: (a) the classical one, where the market players maximize profits and
the outcome of the game is a Cournot-Nash equilibrium; (b) a contest in which
players strive to win a fixed prize/bonus employing unbeatable strategies.
Passing from (a) to (b) leads to a perfect competition with zero profits of the
players (Schaffer's paradox). Transition from (b) to (a) results in a
substantial decline in the production output, which also seems paradoxical, as
it is commonly accepted that competition increases efficiency. We examine these
phenomena in two versions of the Cournot model: with a homogeneous good and
with differentiated goods.

lookback and lookahead biases that can undermine econometric inference. It
exceeds domain-specific baselines on NLP benchmarks while maintaining temporal
consistency. Applied to patent texts, NoLBERT enables the construction of
firm-level innovation networks and shows that gains in innovation centrality
predict higher long-run profit growth.

TL;DR: 本文首次提供性别差异在医疗利用方面的因果证据，解释女性寿命更长但健康状况更差的健康-生存悖论。研究发现男性比女性使用更多医疗服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解男性-女性健康-生存悖论，即女性寿命更长但健康状况更差的现象，通过分析医疗利用的性别差异来探索这一悖论背后的原因。

Method: 使用丹麦行政医疗数据，采用交错双重差分方法，利用治疗时间点的随机性来估计非致命性心脏病发作或中风等不良健康冲击对医疗使用的因果影响。

Result: 研究发现男性持续比女性使用更多的医疗服务，这揭示了导致健康结果性别差异的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于更广泛地讨论医疗公平性，并为旨在解决这些不平衡的政策干预提供信息。

Abstract: This paper is the first to provide causal evidence of gender differences in
healthcare utilisation to better understand the male-female health-survival
paradox, where women live longer but experience worse health outcomes. Using
rich Danish administrative healthcare data, we apply a staggered
difference-in-differences approach that exploits the randomness in treatment
timing to estimate the causal impact of adverse health shocks, such as
non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, on healthcare use. Our findings suggest
that men consistently use more healthcare than women, highlighting the
underlying factors driving gender disparities in health outcomes. These
insights contribute to the broader discourse on healthcare equity and inform
policy interventions aimed at addressing these imbalances.

*Nathan Engelman Lado,Richard Chen,Saurabh Amin*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文分析了从固定电价转向分时电价对消费者的福利影响，发现低收入家庭等消费模式不灵活的群体最容易遭受福利损失，建议分时电价政策需要配套措施确保公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分时电价政策对不同消费者群体的分布影响，特别是对低收入消费者的福利影响，因为现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 建立理论框架分析消费者异质性对福利结果的影响，考虑异质消费需求、供应成本和未满足消费的效用损失等现实假设，推导识别消费者福利损失的充分条件。

Result: 发现消费者脆弱性取决于消费时间、需求灵活性和价格敏感性的交互作用。高峰消费高且需求不灵活的消费者（通常是低收入家庭）最易遭受福利损失。需求灵活性只有在价格变化大时才能提供福利保护。

Conclusion: 分时电价政策应配套针对性政策，确保公平获得需求响应能力和定价收益，避免价格变化集中在弱势群体身上。

Abstract: Time-varying electricity pricing better reflects the varying cost of
electricity compared to flat-rate pricing. Variations between peak and off-peak
costs are increasing due to weather variation, renewable intermittency, and
increasing electrification of demand. Empirical and theoretical studies suggest
that variable pricing can lower electricity supply costs and reduce grid
stress. However, the distributional impacts, particularly on low-income
consumers, remain understudied. This paper develops a theoretical framework to
analyze how consume heterogeneity affects welfare outcomes when electricity
markets transition from flat-rate to time-varying pricing, considering
realistic assumptions about heterogeneous consumer demand, supply costs, and
utility losses from unmet consumption.
  We derive sufficient conditions for identifying when consumers lose utility
from pricing reforms and compare welfare effects across consumer types. Our
findings reveal that consumer vulnerability depends on the interaction of
consumption timing, demand flexibility capabilities, and price sensitivity
levels. Consumers with high peak-period consumption and inflexible demand,
characteristics often associated with low-income households, are most
vulnerable to welfare losses. Critically, we demonstrate that demand
flexibility provides welfare protection only when coincident with large price
changes. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that aggregate flexibility patterns
generate spillover effects through pricing mechanisms, with peak periods
experiencing greater price changes when they have less aggregate flexibility,
potentially concentrating larger price increases among vulnerable populations
that have a limited ability to respond. These findings suggest that variable
pricing policies should be accompanied by targeted policies ensuring equitable
access to demand response capabilities and pricing benefits.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过在印尼对12,000家微个企业进行的大规模电子邮件实验，研究了地理距离对税收执法效果的影响。结果显示威慨信息最有效，每花费1美元可生成30美元税收，但需要根据地理位置进行差异化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家小企业税收遵从度低，但对地区环境如何影响执法效果了解少。理论和实证研究对税务机构地理近距离与税收遵从的关系存在混淆结果。

Method: 与印尼税务局合作，对12,000家微、小、中型企业进行大规模自然现场实验，随机分配接受威慨信息、普法信息、公共资产信息或无信息的邮件。

Result: 所有邮件都提高了税收遵从，威慨信息效果最好，大幅提高申报率和月度税收。每花费1美元威慨邮件在一年内可生成30美元额外收入。大城市附近的企业本身遵从度就很高，而威慨信息在非大城市地区能将遵从率提升到相似水平。但对大城市附近已经遵从的企业发送威慨信息会产生负面效果。

Conclusion: 税收执法效果与地理距离存在明显关联，需要根据企业所处地理位置制定差异化的税务管理策略。这些结果为地理近距离与税收执法效果的关系提供了新的实验证据，有助于解释税收遵从文献中的混淆发现。

Abstract: Tax compliance among small businesses remains low in developing countries,
yet little is known about how regional context shapes the effectiveness of
enforcement strategies. Both theory and evidence suggest an ambiguous
relationship between compliance and geographic proximity to tax offices. We
study this issue using a large-scale natural field experiment with Indonesia's
tax authority involving 12,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
Businesses were randomly assigned to receive deterrence, information, or public
goods letters, or no message. All letters improved compliance, with deterrence
messages producing the largest gains - substantially increasing filing rates
and raising monthly tax payments. Each dollar spent on deterrence letters
generated about US$30 in additional revenue over the course of a year. We
observe high compliance among non-treated MSMEs near metropolitan tax offices
and find that enforcement messages successfully raise compliance in
non-metropolitan regions to comparable levels. However, targeting already
compliant MSMEs near metropolitan tax offices backfires, underscoring the need
for geographically tailored tax administration strategies. These results
provide novel experimental evidence on the relation between geographic
proximity and the effectiveness of tax enforcement, helping to reconcile mixed
findings in the tax compliance literature.

Motivation: 传统信息成本模型无法充分解释实验证据中观察到的行为偏差，需要新的理论框架来捕捉"平衡"输出比"极端"输出成本更低的现象。

Method: 采用混合凸性和次可加性公理，推导出基于Rényi散度的信息成本函数表示形式，分析信号分布在状态间的差异。

Result: 构建了一类新颖的成本函数，能够表达为状态间信号分布的Rényi散度，突破了标准后验可分离成本的限制。

Conclusion: 提出的凸信息成本框架为理解信息处理行为提供了更灵活的理论工具，能够更好地拟合实验观测数据。

Abstract: This paper characterizes convex information costs using an axiomatic
approach. We employ mixture convexity and sub-additivity, which capture the
idea that producing "balanced" outputs is less costly than producing
``extreme'' ones. Our analysis leads to a novel class of cost functions that
can be expressed in terms of R\'enyi divergences between signal distributions
across states. This representation allows for deviations from the standard
posterior-separable cost, thereby accommodating recent experimental evidence.
We also characterize two simpler special cases, which can be written as either
the maximum or a convex transformation of posterior-separable costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在观察学习和搜索摩擦的市场中，企业如何定价以及消费者如何做出购买决策，特别关注价格分散和错误信息级联的现象。

Method: 采用对称双寡头模型，结合随机到达和搜索摩擦，分析固定标价下的混合策略定价均衡，并提供封闭式级联带和吸收概率。同时考察Calvo价格重置机制和 prominence（偏向性首次访问）的影响。

Result: 存在混合策略定价均衡导致价格分散；错误级联在内部参数下以正概率发生；价格支持集是连通且重叠的；信号精度提高和搜索成本降低会减少价格分散；Calvo价格重置会降低稳态分散和平均价格。

Conclusion: 状态依赖的庇古搜索补贴可以实现规划者的最优截止点；中性 prominence 是事前最优的，而偏向性 prominence 会软化竞争并降低福利。

Abstract: We embed observational learning (BHW) in a symmetric duopoly with random
arrivals and search frictions. With fixed posted prices, a mixed-strategy
pricing equilibrium exists and yields price dispersion even with ex-ante
identical firms. We provide closed-form cascade bands and show wrong cascades
occur with positive probability for interior parameters, vanishing as signals
become precise or search costs fall; absorption probabilities are invariant to
the arrival rate. In equilibrium, the support of mixed prices is connected and
overlapping; its width shrinks with signal precision and expands with search
costs, and mean prices comove accordingly. Under Calvo price resets (Poisson
opportunities), stationary dispersion and mean prices fall; when signals are
sufficiently informative, wrong-cascade risk also declines. On welfare, a
state-contingent Pigouvian search subsidy implements the planner's cutoff.
Prominence (biased first visits) softens competition and depresses welfare;
neutral prominence is ex-ante optimal.

Result: 聚合采用对数似然比加性形式；轻触设计能实现严格信息性和渐近效率（一致状态学习和声誉识别）；高斯扩展得到模仿系数和线性滤波；共同冲击下GLS权重最优且相关减缓学习

Conclusion: 该框架适用于多种实际场景，提供透明的比较静态和可检验的隐含意义，为从关心声誉的专家中有效学习提供了理论基础和实用设计

Abstract: We study social learning from multiple experts whose precision is unknown and
who care about reputation. The observer both learns a persistent state and
ranks experts. In a binary baseline we characterize per-period equilibria: high
types are truthful; low types distort one-sidedly with closed-form mixing
around the prior. Aggregation is additive in log-likelihood ratios. Light-touch
design -- evaluation windows scored by strictly proper rules or small convex
deviation costs -- restores strict informativeness and delivers asymptotic
efficiency under design (consistent state learning and reputation
identification). A Gaussian extension yields a mimicry coefficient and linear
filtering. With common shocks, GLS weights are optimal and correlation slows
learning. The framework fits advisory panels, policy committees, and
forecasting platforms, and yields transparent comparative statics and testable
implications.

Motivation: 研究职业考虑模型在当代环境中的应用，特别是在部分任务产生公开可移植历史而公司任务保持不透明的情况下，劳动者如何在保险和信息生成之间做出选择。

Method: 建立一个动态劳动市场模型，劳动者每期在自主经营（产出公开可观察）和公司就业（获得固定工资但个人表现隐藏）之间选择，考虑风险避嫌和声誉价值。

Result: 发现：（1）存在吸收性就业区域，低声誉劳动者偏好公司保险；（2）高声誉劳动者选择自主经营以产生公开信号；（3）在均衡公司中，申请选择作为信号影响招聘阈值和工资。

Conclusion: 论文提供了可测验的预测，解释了公开表现记录的价值，并揭示了公司内部不透明性对声誉激励的影响。

Abstract: We analyze a dynamic labor market in which a worker with career concerns
chooses each period between (i) self-employment that makes output publicly
observable and (ii) employment at a firm that pays a flat wage but keeps
individual performance hidden from outside observers. Output is binary and the
worker is risk averse. The worker values future opportunities through a
reputation for talent; firms may be benchmark (myopic) (ignoring the
informational content of an application) or equilibrium (updating beliefs from
the very act of applying). Three forces shape equilibrium: an insurance -
information trade-off, selection by reputation, and inference from application
decisions. We show that (i) an absorbing employment region exists in which
low-reputation workers strictly prefer the firm's insurance and optimally cease
producing public information; (ii) sufficiently strong reputation triggers
self-employment in order to generate public signals and preserve future outside
options; and (iii) with equilibrium firms, application choices act as signals
that shift hiring thresholds and wages even when in-firm performance remains
opaque. Comparative statics deliver sharp, testable predictions for the
prevalence of self-employment, the cyclicality of switching, and wage dynamics
across markets with different degrees of performance transparency. The
framework links classic career-concerns models to contemporary environments in
which some tasks generate portable, public histories while firm tasks remain
unobserved by the outside market (e.g., open-source contributions, freelancing
platforms, or sales roles with standardized public metrics). Our results
rationalize recent empirical findings on the value of public performance
records and illuminate when opacity inside firms dampens or amplifies
reputational incentives.

Motivation: 标准单调均衡在存在小错误时可能不够稳健，需要引入完美单调均衡的概念来增强贝叶斯博弈中均衡的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建两个反例来证明现有条件的不足，建立更强的数学条件（递增差异和超模性）来确保均衡存在，并将结果应用于多单位拍卖等实际场景。

Result: 证明了单交叉条件和拟超模性不足以保证完美单调均衡存在，而递增差异和超模性是确保均衡存在的必要条件。

Conclusion: 完美单调均衡为贝叶斯博弈提供了更稳健的均衡概念，需要更强的数学条件来保证其存在性，这一结果对拍卖理论和竞争分析具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of perfect monotone equilibrium in Bayesian
games, which refines the standard monotone equilibrium by accounting for the
possibility of unintended moves (trembling hand) and thereby enhancing
robustness to small mistakes. We construct two counterexamples to demonstrate
that the commonly used conditions in Athey (2001), McAdams (2003) and Reny
(2011) - specifically, the single crossing condition and quasi-supermodularity
- are insufficient to guarantee the existence of a perfect monotone
equilibrium. Instead, we establish that the stronger conditions of increasing
differences and supermodularity are required to ensure equilibrium existence.
To illustrate the practical relevance of our findings, we apply our main
results to multiunit auctions and further extend the analysis to first-price
auctions, all-pay auctions, and Bertrand competitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究贝叶斯智能体在观察多维状态公共信息时的信念极化现象，扩展Baliga等人(2013)关于一维信念不可能发散的结果到多维情形。

Method: 分析多维设置下的信念更新过程，研究不同随机顺序下的极化可能性，提供信号结构对持续极化的必要条件。

Result: 发现多维设置中所有边际信念都可能出现极化，但多维随机占优意义上的极化不可能；中间随机顺序下极化可能只在短期出现。

Conclusion: 建立了多维信念极化的理论框架，揭示了信号结构对持续极化的关键作用，并对行动极化具有重要启示。

Abstract: We study belief polarization among Bayesian agents observing public
information about a multidimensional state. Baliga et al. (2013) show that
divergence in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance is impossible for
one dimensional beliefs, but we find that in multidimensional settings it can
occur for all marginal beliefs, even with infinitely many signals. At the same
time, we extend their impossibility result: divergence in the sense of
multidimensional stochastic dominance is impossible. For an intermediate
stochastic order, polarization may arise only in the short-run. We provide
necessary and sufficient conditions on signal structures for persistent
polarization and discuss implications for polarization in actions.

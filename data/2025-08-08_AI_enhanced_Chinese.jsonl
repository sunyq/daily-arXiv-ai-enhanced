Using specialized dictionaries tailored to\nCOVID-19, unconventional monetary policy (UMP), and financial stability,\ncombined with sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques, we identify a\ndistinct focus in Fed communication during the pandemic on financial stability,\nmarket volatility, social welfare, and UMP, characterized by notable contextual\nuncertainty. Through comparative analysis, we juxtapose the Fed's communication\nduring the COVID-19 crisis with its responses during the dot-com and global\nfinancial crises, examining content, sentiment, and timing dimensions. Our\nfindings reveal that Fed communication and policy actions were more reactive to\nthe COVID-19 crisis than to previous crises. Additionally, declining sentiment\nrelated to financial stability in interest rate announcements and minutes\nanticipated subsequent accommodative monetary policy decisions. We further\ndocument that communicating about UMP has become the \"new normal\" for the Fed's\nFederal Open Market Committee meeting minutes and Chairman's speeches since the\nGlobal Financial Crisis, reflecting an institutional adaptation in\ncommunication strategy following periods of economic distress.

To address this, we introduce statistically validated correlation\nnetworks that retain only statistically significant correlations via a rigorous\nt-test of Pearson coefficients. We then propose a novel structure termed the\nlargest strong-correlation balanced module (LSCBM), defined as the maximum-size\ngroup of stocks with structural balance (i.e., positive edge-ign products for\nall triplets) and strong pairwise correlations. This balance condition ensures\nstable relationships, thus facilitating potential hedging opportunities through\nnegative edges. Theoretically, within a random signed graph model, we establish\nLSCBM's asymptotic existence, size scaling, and multiplicity under various\nparameter regimes. To detect LSCBM efficiently, we develop MaxBalanceCore, a\nheuristic algorithm that leverages network sparsity. Simulations validate its\nefficiency, demonstrating scalability to networks of up to 10,000 nodes within\ntens of seconds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that LSCBM identifies core\nmarket subsystems that dynamically reorganize in response to economic shifts\nand crises. In the Chinese stock market (2013-2024), LSCBM's size surges during\nhigh-stress periods (e.g., the 2015 crash) and contracts during stable or\nfragmented regimes, while its composition rotates annually across dominant\nsectors (e.g., Industrials and Financials).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9608\u503c\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165LSCBM\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7a33\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u80a1\u7968\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u5173\u7cfb\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u5173\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLSCBM\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MaxBalanceCore\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eLSCBM\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u80a1\u5e02\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "LSCBM\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e02\u573a\u6838\u5fc3\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u53cd\u6620\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Namjoshi", "Thomas Wies"], "title": "Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices", "comment": null, "summary": "Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice\narchitecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,\nrecording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.

Exogenous information is modelled via\nfiltration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the \"realised tree\", and\nan abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.\n  Based on this, a consistent model of \"rules\" is introduced, leading to the\nnotion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising Al\\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger\n(2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of\norder-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of\nstochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems\nformulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an\napproximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In\nthis formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis\nis essentially well-ordered.\n  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of \"extensive form characteristics\"\nis introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from\nwell-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence,\nwhich is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction\nbehaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is\ntackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a\nsuitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a\nnatural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium.

It presents portfolio strategies associated with dynamic risks. A\ntime-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) model is used to study\nthe spillover and interconnectedness of the risk factors for global supply\nchain infrastructure portfolios from January 5th, 2010, to June 29th, 2023,\nwhich are associated with a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)\nindexes. The effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and investment\nstrategy are calculated and compared before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe results of this study demonstrate that risk shocks influence the dynamic\nconnectedness between global supply chain infrastructure portfolios and three\nrisk factors and show the effects of extreme events on risk spillovers and\ninvestment outcomes. Portfolios with higher ESG scores exhibit stronger dynamic\nconnectedness with other portfolios and factors. Net total directional\nconnectedness indicates that West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Baltic Exchange Dry\nIndex (BDI), and investor sentiment volatility index (VIX) consistently are net\nreceivers of spillover shocks. A portfolio with a ticker GLFOX appears to be a\ntime-varying net receiver and giver. The pairwise connectedness shows that WTI\nand VIX are mostly net receivers.

On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it.

Yet, the central element guiding this process\n-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the\nsurrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime\ncontrol.\n  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a\nlanguage and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts\nstructured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR\nenables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in\nresponse to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing\ncontext; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments\ninto versioned views with support for introspection and logging.\n  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and\nadapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,\nassisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and\nautomation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables\noptimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.\nPreliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes\ncompared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of\nprompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPEAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u516c\u6c11\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u5143\u7d20\u5374\u4ecd\u662f\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u91cd\u7528\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "SPEAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u53ca\u4ee3\u7406\u91cd\u8bd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SPEAR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

When people choose the mediator based on costs and benefits (whether\nto visit a doctor, to attend university, etc.), this assumption fails and\nconventional CM analyses are at risk of bias. I propose a control function\nstrategy that uses instrumental variation in mediator take-up costs, delivering\nunbiased direct and indirect effects when selection is driven by unobserved\ngains.

CoMAD distills from three\npretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct\nsemantic and contextual priors.

Teacher embeddings are\naligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,\nthen fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by\ncombining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement.

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RADAR\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRADAR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53477%\u548c13%\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

For instance, a\nchange that leverages a function must depend on the change that introduces it.\nEstablishing such dependencies allows CI/CD pipelines to build and orchestrate\nchanges effectively, preventing build failures and incomplete feature\ndeployments. In modern software systems, dependencies often span multiple\ncomponents across teams, creating challenges for development and deployment.\nThey serve various purposes, from enabling new features to managing\nconfigurations, and can even involve traditionally independent changes like\ndocumentation updates. To address these challenges, we conducted a preliminary\nstudy on dependency management in OpenStack, a large-scale software system. Our\nstudy revealed that a substantial portion of software changes in OpenStack over\nthe past 10 years are interdependent. Surprisingly, 51.08% of these\ndependencies are identified during the code review phase-after a median delay\nof 5.06 hours-rather than at the time of change creation. Developers often\nspend a median of 57.12 hours identifying dependencies, searching among a\nmedian of 463 other changes. To help developers proactively identify\ndependencies, we propose a semi-automated approach that leverages two ML\nmodels.

In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a\ndiverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by\nmulti-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves\nLoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural\ndiversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct\nchallenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head\narchitecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex\nmulti-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the\nmulti-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard\nsingle-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly\ncompetitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective\nMTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not\nisolating task-specific features.

It is\nrapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how\nknowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings\nfrom a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language\nmodel designed to scaffold student research question development through\nstructured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65\npre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with\nthe Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students\nusing the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,\nindependent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate\nmetacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due\nto generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a\nbroader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of\nspecialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of\norchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated\nby educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated\nroles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted\noffer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from\nthese agents.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values.

Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey.

However, these auxiliary components tend to\nintroduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,\nidentity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the\nneed for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly\nleverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer\nperformance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the\nsource image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce\nRefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the\nreference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive\nextraction of makeup-related information.

To\naddress this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation\nMulti-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification\nby eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL\ncomprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which\noperates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance\nPre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution\ncounterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for\nWSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify\nirrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation\n(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution\npatch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence\nwith patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and\nefficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first\nChebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational\npathology, which improves classification performance through learnable\nactivation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate\nthat AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both\nclassification performance and inference speed.

Accurate and robust segmentation\nmodels are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision\nmaking across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in\nimage characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of\ngeneralizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.\nThis model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for\nmodality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major\nchallenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT\nvs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these\nissues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables\nmultimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method\nintegrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module\nthat harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local\ntraining. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset\nand a complete dataset.

While existing\nmethods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint\ncross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation\nand improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species\nremain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address\nthis, we propose \\textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for\ncross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.\nX-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational\nautoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion\ninto a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss.

Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to\ngeneralize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.\nExtensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases\nthe number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder\ndatasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching\nDirection Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,\nachieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/Beryl2000/EndoMatcher.", "AI": {"tldr": "EndoMatcher\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u57df\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652fVision Transformer\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u4ea4\u4e92\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6Endo-Mix6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Hamlyn\u548cBladder\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5185\u70b9\u5339\u914d\u6570\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347140.69%\u548c201.43%\uff0c\u5728Gastro-Matching\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aMDPA\u63d0\u53479.40%\u3002", "conclusion": "EndoMatcher\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u5668\u5b98\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we\nintroduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages\nclinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model\nto align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology\nreports.

However, most CVL methods\noutput only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant\nobservations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess\nlocalization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.\nTo tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an\na-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering\nout mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m\nto under 3\\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean\nlocalization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from\n$\\mathbf{3.42^{\\circ}}$ to $\\mathbf{1.24^{\\circ}}$, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods.

We bring two core observations that reshape our\nunderstanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear\ninterpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our\nanalysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in\nhigh-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises\ndue to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we\npropose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a\nnon-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical\ncontrol over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''\nfor anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel\nunsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for\nanomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework\nthat scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM\nfor the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset.

While chirality has been extensively\nstudied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point\nclouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex\ndescriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body\ntransformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and\nright symmetric parts.

However, real-world applications face significant\nocclusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model.

Existing methods mainly rely on\nimage-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their\nability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity\nlocal details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a\nhierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It\ncombines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic\nassessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality\nanalysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic\nappearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes\nsuch as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we\nconstruct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and\nhigh-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation\npipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based\nrepresentations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance\nmodeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for\npart-level perception.

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive\nperformance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and\nYouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated\nobjects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the\nstrengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more\nchallenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world\nconditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks\nfor 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2\nintroduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent\nobject disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller\nobjects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,\nrain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot\nsequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,\nreflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20\nrepresentative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent\nperformance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%\non MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar\ndeclines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks.

As point clouds serve as a widely-used and\neasily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point\nclouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions.

Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on\nobscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template\nprotection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We\npropose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages\nthe latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize\nprivacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to\nirreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code\nderived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through\na carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric\nrequirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable\nfaces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring\nany modifications.

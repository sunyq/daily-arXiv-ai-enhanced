### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理(GSP)作为核心计算框架，将符号逻辑和神经推理在频谱域中整合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型仅将频谱图方法作为外围组件，需要更数学基础和计算高效的推理系统来提升逻辑一致性和可解释性

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理，包括图傅里叶变换、带选择注意力和频谱规则基础

Result: 在多个基准推理数据集上相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础和计算高效的基础

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于目标导向状态表示的计算框架，其中描述性和规范性方面从智能体-环境交互序列中共同涌现，借鉴佛教认识论引入telic状态概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将世界模型分为状态表示和奖励函数两个独立组件，但本文探索另一种可能性：这两个方面可能从智能体的目标中相互依赖地共同涌现。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别，通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计差异来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨不同基质的目性行为提供了统一的解释，挑战了传统强化学习中状态表示和奖励函数分离的经典观点，展示了从经验中共同涌现的世界模型构建方式。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商，有效解决流行度偏见并提升推荐多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多被忽视的旅游地点得到关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）分别生成城市推荐，然后通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商和整合，惩罚重复或无关响应。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验表明，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的旅游地点。

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型控制人群代理运动的新方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航来实现更真实的人群模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群模拟方法主要关注转向和高层目标推断，忽略了语言对话对人群导航和运动的重要影响，缺乏复杂的社会和环境交互

Method: 使用基于代理的大语言模型，结合角色个性、欲望和关系生成代理间对话，然后利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制每个代理的导航和转向

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了方法有效性，观察到代理自动分组和解组，实现了人群内的信息传递机制，产生了更真实的人群模拟和自然涌现的群体行为

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合语言对话和感知输入，能够产生更真实的人群模拟效果，群体行为能够从环境设置中自然涌现

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [5] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现推理预算增加反而损害LLM置信度校准，搜索增强生成比纯推理表现更好，信息访问是置信度校准的关键瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型作为问答工具时的置信度校准问题，研究推理能力和计算预算如何影响置信度评估准确性

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下的置信度校准表现，比较纯推理与搜索增强生成方法

Result: 推理LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会系统性导致过度自信；搜索增强生成达到89.3%准确率，显著优于纯推理

Conclusion: 信息访问而非推理深度或推理预算，是知识密集型任务置信度校准改进的关键瓶颈

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: In partnership with Ubotica Technologies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
demonstrating state-of-the-art data analysis onboard CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6).
CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for
numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [7] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时提高安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐，导致不安全行为。现有安全感知适应方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1) MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2) 设计SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3) 事后修剪这些风险层

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将劳动力管理建模为抽象论证框架，通过形式化方法处理执行时的变化并提供可信解释，用户研究表明该方法比传统手工解决方案更高效准确


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力管理在执行时需要适应变化并为所有利益相关者提供解释，传统方法难以满足这一需求

Method: 将劳动力管理问题建模为抽象论证框架，通过形式化论证处理执行时的变化，并生成相应的解释

Result: 用户研究表明，该工具和解释方法比传统手工解决方案能带来更快、更准确的问题解决效果

Conclusion: 抽象论证框架为工业应用中的劳动力管理提供了一种有效的方法来处理变化和生成可信解释，显著提升了问题解决效率

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

### [9] [Open-Universe Assistance Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119)
*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Open-Universe Assistance Games框架和GOOD方法，通过LLM模拟用户意图进行概率推理，在开放目标空间中实现高效的目标推断和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI代理需要推断和处理未预定义的人类多样化目标和偏好的挑战，特别是在开放且不断演变的目标空间中。

Method: GOOD方法：使用LLM模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，通过对话提取自然语言目标，并进行概率推理来推断目标分布，无需大型离线数据集。

Result: 在基于文本的杂货购物领域和模拟家庭机器人环境(AI2Thor)中评估，使用合成用户配置文件，GOOD方法在LLM和人类评估中都优于没有显式目标跟踪的基线方法。

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，在开放宇宙辅助游戏中有效处理未预定义的人类目标，为具身AI提供了数据高效的目标推理解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统期刊和会议依赖人工同行评审，难以规模化且不愿接受AI生成的研究内容；现有预印本服务器缺乏严格的质量控制机制，导致高质量AI研究缺乏合适的传播渠道。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，允许人类和AI科学家提交、评审和迭代改进研究提案和论文，提供API和MCP接口实现异构人类和AI科学家的无缝集成。

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家建立了新一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决GUI环境中代理模型的性能瓶颈，需要开发一个能够处理桌面和移动环境多种任务的基础模型，并建立高质量的训练数据和有效的强化学习框架

Method: 采用基于云的大规模虚拟环境基础设施，结合自进化GUI轨迹生成框架，通过自动化查询生成和正确性验证产生高质量交互数据；整合UI定位、规划、动作语义和推理模式；开发可扩展的异步强化学习框架和轨迹感知相对策略优化

Result: GUI-Owl-7B在AndroidWorld达到66.4分，OSWorld达到29.4分；Mobile-Agent-v3进一步提升至AndroidWorld 73.3分和OSWorld 37.7分；在线RL达到OSWorld 34.9分

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为GUI代理提供了强大的基础模型和框架，通过创新的数据生成方法和强化学习技术，在多个基准测试中创造了新的性能记录，并已开源供社区使用

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模合成可验证的数学逻辑谜题数据集，通过训练显著提升LLM在逻辑推理任务上的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量的可验证数学逻辑数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范，通过系统变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，并通过重现机制确保有效性

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化程序验证谜题的基准测试集，训练后PuzzleClone平均得分从14.4提升至56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得最高12.5个百分点的绝对提升

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够有效生成大规模高质量可验证数据，显著提升LLM的逻辑推理能力，为解决数据可靠性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat是一个专门针对罕见病多汗症的开源LLM框架，通过数据增强、微调和专家评估三阶段流程，为多汗症提供可信赖和共情的诊断治疗支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在罕见病医疗应用面临数据稀缺和不可靠的挑战，多汗症影响2-3%人口但缺乏专门的AI支持系统。

Method: 三阶段流程：1)使用前沿LLM生成医学可信的合成数据；2)在开源基础模型上进行微调；3)临床和心理专家评估并迭代丰富数据集。

Result: LLM4Sweat在基准测试中表现优于基线模型，成为首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为多汗症和其他类似数据稀缺的罕见病提供了可推广的解决方案，解决了可信度和数据挑战。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

### [14] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在严格资源、时间和操作约束下的推理可靠性尚未充分研究，需要系统评估其在复杂约束环境中的表现。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，在资源约束项目调度问题中逐步增加非冗余前序约束、停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中进行实例化评估。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的有向无环图上表现接近上限，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能急剧下降，约束交互是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在约束交互场景中泛化能力有限，合成测试的性能不能保证在领域实际场景中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出See it. Say it. Sorted.系统，通过VLM和LLM的协作将手绘草图转换为精确可编辑的SVG图表，在流程图生成上优于GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在照片级真实感方面表现出色，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表生成的需求。

Method: 训练免费的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大语言模型(LLMs)，通过迭代循环：批评VLM提出编辑建议，多个候选LLM生成SVG更新，法官VLM选择最佳候选。

Result: 在10个来自已发表论文的流程图草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重建布局和结构，能精确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法优先考虑定性推理而非脆弱的数值估计，保持全局约束，支持人工干预，输出可编程SVG便于扩展和集成到演示工具中。代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市土地利用分配是一个复杂的多目标优化问题，对于可持续城市发展政策至关重要。需要找到土地利用兼容性与经济目标之间的平衡点。

Method: 发展了多种优化算法，包括结合差分进化和多目标遗传算法的自定义变体。关键技术包括CR+DES算法（利用缩放差分向量）、系统性约束放松策略以及使用Kruskal-Wallis检验的统计验证。

Result: 在1,290个地块的实际案例中，CR+DES算法在土地利用兼容性上比现有最佳方法提高3.16%，MSBX+MO算法在价格优化上提高3.3%。统计分析确认包含差分向量的算法在多个指标上显著超过传统方法。

Conclusion: 约束放松技术能够在保持实际约束的前提下扩展解空间探索。这些发现为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，支持在快速城市化地区的更有效城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

TL;DR: 基于认知心理学理论的多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的记忆模块方法(如MemoryBank、A-MEM)存储的记忆内容质量差，影响回忆性能和响应质量，需要更好地处理互动过程中产生的大量历史数据。

Method: 设计了受认知心理学启发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元(一一对应)。在检索阶段匹配最相关的检索记忆单元，获取对应的上下文记忆单元作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性，消融实验确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆片段数量的稳健性和存储开销，证明了其实用价值。

Conclusion: 多重记忆系统(MMS)能够有效构建高质量的长期记忆内容，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能，从而更有效地利用历史数据来提升大语言模型代理的表现。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖单粒度记忆机制，受限于收集经验的质量，导致知识多样性和规划灵活性不足。需要一种更灵活的记忆框架来适应多样化场景。

Method: 提出粗到细粒度记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）遇到环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思。

Result: 该方法能够更充分地利用记忆，实现灵活的场景适应，特别是在面对环境异常时能够进行有效的计划修正。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制显著提升了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的表现和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好两种人类反馈，通过搜索相似状态-动作对来分配信用，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习需要良好定义的奖励函数但设计困难，人类反馈中专家演示成本高且模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配问题未解决

Method: SPW方案：在偏好标记轨迹中搜索与专家演示最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效联合学习偏好和演示，在挑战性机器人操作任务上优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW通过统一两种人类反馈源解决了信用分配问题，实现了更准确的离线强化学习

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策制定，包含修订需求，并支持环境感知以确保计划可行性。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能提升，表明在真实世界旅行规划方面取得了显著进展。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架提供了有希望的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的框架来改善心血管诊断。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，使LLM能够建模时间动态；在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得强劲性能，并保持对分布外设置的泛化能力，实验证明了各组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了更通用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define
various planning-based compilations that aim to jointly optimize both the sum
of action costs and plan disruption. Experimental results in different
benchmarks show that the reformulated task can be effectively solved in
practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.

minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

Motivation: 现有链式思维推理方法在处理复杂任务时可能产生过长的推理链，导致计算资源浪费和响应速度下降，需要一种能够根据任务难度自适应调整推理深度的机制。

Method: 建立块结构范式：模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后相应划分推理过程；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的直接偏好优化、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制推理深度。

Result: 该方法能够使LLM根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度，实现从零推理到深度推理的灵活切换。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架通过块结构化和自适应训练机制，有效解决了链式思维推理中的过思考问题，提高了推理效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: 为语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地导致更多合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Conclusion: DeepThink3D通过生成更复杂问题和优化工具链策略，有效提升了大语言模型在3D场景推理中的性能，为复杂3D推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要一种能够分析策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL代理和环境建模为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并开发了MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标来形式化测量安全性。

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中验证了框架的有效性，成功识别出仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了全面且可解释的策略行为评估，能够超越定性可视化，为RL策略提供形式化的安全保证和鲁棒性分析。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

*Alfio Gliozzo,Naweed Khan,Christodoulos Constantinides,Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Nahuel Defosse,Junkyu Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentics是一个模块化框架，用于构建基于agent的系统，支持结构化推理和组合泛化，通过数据建模而非提示工程来实现逻辑转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI开发需要大量手工编写提示，Agentics旨在让开发者专注于数据建模，通过声明式语言和LLM驱动的逻辑转换简化工作流程。

Method: 将agent从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用，通过LLM执行类型连接时的逻辑转换，实现数据类型的组合和推理。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中达到最先进准确率或提升可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics提供了一个有效框架，通过数据建模和逻辑转换简化AI工作流程，在多个任务中表现出色，具有开源实现。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

### [30] [Adapting A Vector-Symbolic Memory for Lisp ACT-R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15630)
*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用光学声纳声存系统HDM替代ACT-R的声明式存储系统，实现了向量符号处理和优化的谨念取回机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了给ACT-R模型提供更好的可扩展性和计算效率，同时保持与现有模型的兼容性

Method: 将HDM集成到Lisp ACT-R中，开发向量化的ACT-R函数，建立文本处理流水线，创建基于向量表示的完整谨念取回机制

Result: 初步结果显示HDM能保持向量符号优势，同时让现有ACT-R模型可以少或无修改地运行

Conclusion: HDM为ACT-R提供了一个可扩展、高效的声明式存储替代方案，并将通过时间上下文表示和IBL理论模型进一步优化

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [31] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化多智能体强化学习中个体智能体的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈即可评估智能体行为贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖显式奖励信号或学习到的价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈的情况下难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种能够仅通过策略分布分析就能获得有意义行为洞察的方法。

Method: 受智能体倾向于追求收敛工具价值现象启发，引入ICVs方法：1) 基于信息论Shapley值；2) 量化每个智能体对同伴工具赋能的因果影响；3) 通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来测量智能体行动对队友策略的影响。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，该方法能够识别哪些智能体行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动选择的灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为合作动态提供了新颖的洞察，增强了MARL系统的可解释性，能够在没有价值反馈的情况下可靠地理解个体智能体行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [32] [Futurity as Infrastructure: A Techno-Philosophical Interpretation of the AI Lifecycle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15680)
*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，揭示AI数据生命周期中递归价值链的动态特性，挑战现有负责任AI框架，提出基于Simondon哲学的形式化分析方法和监管建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI政策制定缺乏对AI技术运作和经济逻辑中动态变化过程的理解，需要从技术哲学角度分析AI生命周期中的递归价值链和监管盲点。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，引入Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念来建模AI生命周期（前个体环境、个体化、个体化AI），提出"未来性"概念描述AI自我强化的递归特性。

Result: 揭示了AI基础设施（如特征存储）如何通过反馈、适应和时间递归实现数据非竞争性的递归生成，凸显了技术寡头在价值捕获和决策集中造成的权力不对称。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在视觉推理任务上的评估缺乏统一、可扩展的基准测试，需要能够控制数据语义、结构和清晰度的标准化评估框架。

Method: 使用Python可视化库程序化生成图表和合成渲染表格，每个实例包含图表/表格图像和基于视觉内容的多步骤分析问题，答案以JSON或YAML等结构化格式提供。

Result: GRAFT引入了包括比较、趋势识别、排名、聚合、比例估计和异常检测在内的推理类型分类法，支持对多模态模型的全面评估。

Conclusion: GRAFT为多模态模型在视觉基础的结构化推理任务上提供了统一、可扩展的细粒度基准测试框架，为该领域设立了新的评估标准。

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

TL;DR: 本文首次在生产环境中测量AI推理的环境影响，发现Gemini文本提示的能耗(0.24Wh)和水耗(0.26mL)远低于公众预期，并展示了谷歌通过软件优化和清洁能源实现的显著减排效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI应用加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但此前缺乏生产环境中的实际测量研究。

Method: 提出并执行了全面的测量方法，涵盖AI服务基础设施全栈（包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能耗、空闲机器容量和数据中心能耗开销），通过对谷歌Gemini AI助手基础设施的详细检测来实现。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示中位数能耗为0.24Wh，水耗为0.26mL；谷歌的软件效率优化和清洁能源采购使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹减少44倍；AI提示能耗低于观看9秒电视。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注；全面的环境指标测量对于准确比较模型和激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过重新调整最先进的语言模型，建立了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估对话中的假社交线索，通过五阶段测试在小型合成数据集上完全检测所有假社交对话，且避免了假阻性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们与AI代理发展假社交关系会对人类健康产生严重甚至悲剧性影响，而防止这种动态具有挑战性，因为假社交线索通常在私密对话中渐进形成，且不是所有情感参与都是有害的

Method: 重新调整最先进的语言模型，创建了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估对话中的假社交线索，并使用一个包含30个对话的小型合成数据集（涵盖假社交、奇娇和中性对话）进行迭代评估

Result: 通过五阶段测试和宽松的一致性规则，成功识别了所有假社交对话，同时避免了假阻性，检测通常在前几次交流中就可以完成

Conclusion: 这些发现为评估代理可以为防止假社交关系提供可行解决方案提供了预期证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: LGT是一个基于多智能体大语言模型的配置优化框架，通过自然语言推理和文本梯度反馈实现智能配置调优，在多个数据集上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性和动态适应性，自动化方法难以进行语义推理。

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架，包含提议配置变更的Advisor、评估进展的Evaluator和优化决策过程的Optimizer，通过文本梯度提供语义反馈。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著性能提升，同时保持高可解释性。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的推理和文本梯度反馈，有效解决了配置优化的关键挑战，实现了性能提升和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一的协同训练框架，通过单一SFT阶段集成多种安全行为（积极、消极、拒绝），使用系统指令或魔法令牌动态切换，实现细粒度安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）依赖多阶段训练流程，缺乏部署后的细粒度可控性，需要更高效灵活的解决方案。

Method: 采用协同训练框架，在单一SFT阶段同时训练三种安全行为模式，通过系统指令动态激活不同模式，形成安全对齐边界。

Result: 8B模型在安全性能上超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)，匹配SFT+DPO的安全对齐质量，同时显著降低训练复杂度和部署成本。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，实现了细粒度的安全行为控制。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于大语言模型的文化本土化框架，自动化生成包含本土实体的多语言数学应用题数据集，以解决现有翻译数据集中英语中心实体偏寮的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言和文化基础的数学推理在资源稀缺语言中较英语欠缺，原因是缺乏反映本土实体的社会文化任务数据集，而现有多语言标准数据集多通过翻译生成且保留英语中心实体。

Method: 提出一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够从现有来源自动构建包含本土名称、组织名称和货币等实体的数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，翻译的标准数据集可能隐藏了真正的多语言数学能力，而本文框架能够减少英语中心实体偏寮，提高各种语言下的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多语言数学推理中的文化本土化问题，为构建真正本土化的多语言数据集提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Motivation: 当前基于意图识别的ConvXAI系统在英语方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的挑战。

Method: 引入MultiCoXQL多语言数据集（覆盖5种语言），提出新的解析方法，并创建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取，使用多种LLM进行多语言评估。

Result: 在5种类型学多样的语言上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估，测试了不同规模的LLM和BERT类模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决ConvXAI系统的多语言泛化问题和自定义输入支持提供了新的数据集和方法框架。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a

*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样算法(SSS)，通过在推理时使用对齐的小型草稿模型来高效实现测试时对齐，显著降低推理成本的同时保持模型安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但会产生巨大的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题

Method: 提出奖励偏移推测采样算法(SSS)，让小型草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励token分布来利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，算法以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的金牌奖励分数

Conclusion: SSS算法有效解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，通过利用分布偏移在不实际获取RLHF最优解的情况下恢复最优解，实现了效率与效果的双重提升

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、过滤候选匹配和结构化蕴含检查，显著提升长文本问答中的信息完整性评估准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易出错，LLM评估方法存在幻觉和对齐问题

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配 3)通过结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的长文本问答基准测试中，相比强基线方法，LongRecall在召回准确性方面有显著提升

Conclusion: LongRecall提供了一个系统化的召回评估基础构件，能够减少假阳性和假阴性，适应不同的表达方式和上下文变化

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将大型语言模型与组合推理相结合的方法，通过符号推理增强LLM的结构一致性，提高结构化预测任务的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言任务中表现出色但存在幻觉和复杂推理问题，特别是在结构化预测任务中，需要结合推理方法提供结构一致性。

Method: 结合LLM与组合推理，研究不同提示策略来估计LLM置信度用于符号推理，并通过校准和基于结构化预测目标的微调来提升性能。

Result: 实验表明无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上添加符号推理都能带来更一致和准确的预测，结构化学习在LLM时代仍有价值。

Conclusion: 将LLM与符号推理相结合能有效解决幻觉和推理问题，结构化学习方法对提升LLM在挑战性任务中的性能至关重要。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nemotron-CC-Math，一个从Common Crawl构建的大规模高质量数学语料库，通过新颖的领域无关流水线实现鲁棒的科学文本提取，显著提升LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Common Crawl的数学数据集因脆弱的提取启发式、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保存数学结构而导致质量下降，需要更高质量的数学预训练数据。

Method: 使用布局感知渲染（lynx）和基于LLM的针对性清理阶段，恢复多种格式的数学内容（MathJax、KaTeX、MathML），保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除样板文件、标准化为LaTeX表示并纠正不一致性。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+（133B tokens）和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+（52B tokens）语料库，后者包含比之前最高质量数学预训练数据集FineMath-4+多5.5倍的token。预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上获得+4.8到+12.6的提升，在MBPP+上获得+4.6到+14.3的提升，同时改善MMLU和MMLU-Stem的通用领域性能。

Conclusion: 提出了第一个从噪声网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的流水线，在数学、代码和通用推理方面带来可衡量的提升，为开源数学预训练语料库设立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型(LLM)由于幻觉问题经常生成误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设才能正确回答。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证任务，提出利用外部证据的方法来缓解幻觉。通过检索证据、生成和验证原子假设来识别错误假设。

Result: 在五个LLM上的实验表明：(1)整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别问题中的错误假设，减少LLM的幻觉，提供更准确和可解释的答案，特别是在处理包含错误假设的问题时表现优异。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环提升多模态模型的复杂对话推理能力，在多个维度超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和多模态大模型在处理复杂多轮视觉对话任务时存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，现有基准无法充分评估真实世界多模态交互的复杂性。

Method: 构建包含300个复杂多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集；提出CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代式"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环机制，无需重新训练底层模型。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上获得平均4.03分的人类评估分数，显著超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计和迭代方法有效解决了复杂多模态交互的挑战，验证了在不重新训练底层模型的情况下显著提升多模态对话推理能力的可行性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一个语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少冗余token，在保持模型性能的同时实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等效token；然后基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵区域使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域设计的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型(PRMs)主要针对通用或STEM领域训练，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更加结构化、符号化且对事实和监管准确性要求更高。

Method: Fin-PRM集成了步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线和在线的奖励学习设置，应用于三种关键场景：高质量推理轨迹选择、强化学习的密集流程级奖励提供、以及测试时的奖励引导最佳推理选择。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA等金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用PRMs和强领域基线。下游模型在使用Fin-PRM训练后获得显著提升：监督学习提升12.9%，强化学习提升5.2%，测试时性能提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于将大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别对KV缓存进行剪枝来减少内存使用，同时动态恢复被剪枝的条目以保持注意力计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型中KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，现有方法主要沿时间轴压缩但忽略了特征维度的重要性差异，导致效率和准确性平衡受限。

Method: 提出通道级别的非结构化稀疏化方法，动态识别和剪枝不重要的KV通道，并在注意力计算时恢复关键信息。

Result: 在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，相比基于驱逐的方法减少30%以上KV缓存存储，即使80%剪枝率下性能下降小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK方法有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈，与现有压缩技术正交兼容，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA表现良好，但在领域特定场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调。引入结构化推理数据生成流程，并整合GRPO来增强推理能力。模拟人类学习的渐进式知识获取过程：先理解概念，再应用于复杂推理。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练LLM的水平。

Conclusion: Selct2Know提供了一种有效且经济的方法来解决领域特定知识获取问题，通过渐进式学习策略和知识自选择机制，在多个专业领域实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: 提出Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池执行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地用过去成功轨迹增强经验池。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单和困难问题上分别平均提升6.1%和4.7%；在τ-bench真实场景中，基于Qwen2.5-7B和72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER通过自引导的经验检索方法有效解决了LLMs在多步骤工具使用中的挑战，实现了持续的性能改进，为复杂工具调用任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动检查表生成作为一种有前景的方法，其实际有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种不同规模的模型上进行实验，通过成对比较和直接评分任务评估检查表效果，并分析检查表项目与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中能提高评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不稳定。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项目也反映了人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准来指导人工和自动评估，检查表在特定评估场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少SLM词汇相关组件内存使用达99%，性能损失极小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在边缘设备部署中面临内存限制瓶颈，词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）占用大量内存，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和缺乏灵活性的问题

Method: 基于词汇局部性原则和计算特性不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：卸载嵌入组件，为LM头实现混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，按需加载词汇组件

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，任务性能仅有最小或没有退化，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了SLM内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了高效的内存优化解决方案

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，一个人工编写的泰语指令数据集，用于评估和调整大语言模型在泰语中的表现，解决传统翻译数据集缺乏文化和专业领域细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在英语上表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现待探索。传统的翻译测试集缺乏文化和专业领域的细节，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 通过多阶段质量控制过程，由标注者、领域专家和AI研究人员协作创建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型。进行了两个研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的性能差距；(2)指令调整研究，隔离本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct调整的模型在领域内和领域外的测试中都超过使用翻译数据的模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业基础的本土指令数据，以改善大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

TL;DR: 提出UniCoM管道和SWORDS算法，通过同义词替换生成高质量代码切换语音样本，构建CS-FLEURS多语言语料库，在ASR和语音翻译任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换(CS)语音技术中数据集稀缺的问题，因为CS在真实对话中很常见但对多语言语音技术构成重大挑战

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（Substituting WORDs with Synonyms），通过替换选定单词为其翻译来生成CS语音，同时考虑词性，保持句子语义不变

Result: 构建的CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可懂度和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动CS语音技术进步，实现更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的人格特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLMs比人类教师更理想化和极化，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，且推理能力越强的模型越容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型模拟专业角色（如教师）时缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，需要建立一个专门的评估框架来检测教师角色LLMs的伦理和心理对齐情况。

Method: 提出EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建88个教师特定道德困境，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 本文建立了首个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了模型能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理安全提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成(RAG)中当检索到的外部上下文与LLM参数知识冲突时，模型无法正确分辨可靠知识源的问题

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware RAG (CARE)框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆token嵌入和对抗性软提示训练来识别不可靠上下文并引导推理

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了一个有前景的方向

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识的管道，构建了TComQA数据集，并在时间问答任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件需要掌握其时间上下文，但时间常识在自然语言中往往不会明确表述。即使是先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此自动挖掘时间常识对于构建鲁棒的语言模型至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到了超过80%的精确度，使用该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动挖掘时间常识，构建高质量的数据集，并提升模型在时间推理任务上的性能，为解决大语言模型在时间常识推理方面的局限性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要不受上下文影响的纯净音素表示，许多语音处理任务需要这种去语境化的音素特征

Method: 使用120毫秒固定宽度窗口独立处理，学习所有语言共有的基础声学模式，参数少于现有方法

Result: 在多样化语言上通过监督和自监督训练，包括UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，展现出强大的跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基础声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图补全模型在不同数据集和不同评估指标（如MRR、Hit@k）下表现不一致，导致模型选择困难，需要统一的评估框架。

Method: 提出EDAS（基于平均解距离的评估）元评估指标，将多个数据集和多种评估标准综合为一个标准化分数（M_i ∈ [0,1]），提供全局视角。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等标准数据集上评估，EDAS能够有效统一多指标多数据集的性能排名，提供一致、稳健且可推广的评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS为知识图补全模型提供了一种统一、可解释且公平的跨数据集评估方法，有助于更明智的模型选择和性能比较。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的可信度存在严重问题，现有评估方法往往关注狭窄方面且忽视了多模态带来的风险，需要构建全面的评估基准来系统性地分析和缓解这些可信度问题。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维度框架：5个可信度方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私性）、2种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）以及多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练和推理算法）。包含32个任务和28个精选数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有MLLM模型，并分析了8种代表性缓解方法。

Result: 实验揭示了当前模型的显著漏洞，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略存在关键局限性，虽然某些方法在特定方面有所改进，但很少有方法能有效解决整体可信度问题，且许多方法会引入意外的权衡而损害模型效用。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来改进提供了实用见解，如推理在更好平衡安全性和性能方面的益处。基于这些见解，提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，使模型具备思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和刚性验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了其加速效果和适应性

Method: 利用起草模型输出分布的熵和边界不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程，实现更灵活的token接受

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用解决方案，可在不同不确定性条件下实现大型语言模型的高效鲁棒解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型词汇表对语言模型性能提升的真正原因，当前实践倾向于使用更大的词汇表但效益来源不明确

Method: 在固定数据、计算和优化条件下，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K进行控制研究，量化token化文本复杂度，分析词汇频率分布和损失分解

Result: 更大的词汇表主要通过降低前2500个高频词汇的不确定性来减少交叉熵，尽管罕见词汇的损失上升；词汇不平衡被模型利用而非遭受

Conclusion: 词汇表大小的效益源于降低token化文本复杂度，这为tokenizer-模型协同设计提供了原则性指导，并阐明了预训练中的损失动态

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在多模态输入处理能力方面得到了增强，但其在处理音频和文本模态间冲突信息时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要建立专门的评估基准。

Method: 开发了MCR-BENCH基准测试，通过大量评估不同音频理解任务，分析模型在冲突音频-文本对中的信息优先级选择，并研究影响因素和缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现LALMs存在显著的文本偏向性，在模态不一致时经常忽视音频证据，导致音频任务性能大幅下降，即使存在矛盾输入时模型仍表现出持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在训练过程中需要改进模态平衡和开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性，为实际应用的可靠性提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

*Mohammad Ibrahim Qani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了语言翻译中的非对应词汇问题，提出了从源语言向目标语言翻译非对应词汇的方法和规则，并将达尔属语和乌兹别克语中的25个非对应词翻译成英语和俄语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言理解与翻译知识直接相关，非对应词汇（如食物、服装、文化和传统词汇）往往造成误解，需要找到它们在目标语言中的对应表达方式。

Method: 采用图书馆基础研究方法，分析了从源语言向目标语言翻译非对应词汇的各种方法和规则。

Result: 研究提出了多种翻译非对应词汇的方法，并实际将达尔属语和乌兹别克语中的25个非对应词翻译成了英语和俄语。

Conclusion: 这项研究为处理语言翻译中的非对应词汇问题提供了专业的方法和规则，虽然部分词汇已经得到处理，但仍有许多词汇需要进一步翻译。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PyTOD是一个可编程的面向任务对话代理，通过生成可执行代码来跟踪对话状态，并使用策略和执行反馈进行高效错误纠正，在SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的对话状态跟踪，但传统方法存在局限性，需要更有效的状态跟踪和错误纠正机制。

Method: PyTOD采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中，PyTOD实现了最先进的对话状态跟踪性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法非常有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和反馈机制显著提升了对话代理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason是一个新颖的放射学报告评估框架，提供细粒度错误类型评分和可解释的临床依据，在ReXVal基准测试中表现优于现有方法，达到与GPT-4相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告自动评估方法要么产生粗糙的总体评分，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，缺乏临床基础、可解释性和细粒度指标，限制了在真实临床工作流程中的应用价值。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，引入两个关键创新：(1)子分数动态加权，根据实时F1统计自适应优先处理临床挑战性错误类型；(2)多数引导优势缩放，基于子分数一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床基础扎实、可解释且细粒度的放射学报告评估框架，通过创新的动态加权和优势缩放技术实现了更稳定的优化和更好的专家临床判断对齐。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLM4Offer是一个基于对比学习的生成式AI模型，通过微调T5-Small模型，在个性化营销报价生成任务上实现了17%的接受率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销对提升客户参与度和业务增长至关重要，现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，而个性化报价生成具有显著提升转化率和客户满意度的潜力

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调预训练的T5-Small编码器-解码器语言模型，采用InfoNCE损失函数在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关报价

Result: 在模拟客户行为和报价接受模式的合成数据集上，相比监督微调基线模型，报价接受率提升了17%

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面具有显著效果，SLM4Offer模型通过自适应学习行为增强了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑大型语言模型在处理用户主观浏览行为时的有效性，提出了一种基于聚类的异质性感知语言模型训练方法HeTLM，发现小型模型在特定任务上优于大型模型，且考虑用户异质性可以提升模型性能和对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大型语言模型在处理用户主观行为和偏好时存在局限性，特别是当用户浏览行为具有高度异质性和主观性时，单一模型难以充分捕捉不同用户的多样化需求。

Method: 提出HeTLM方法，采用基于聚类的异质性感知训练策略，使用页面级分词器训练小型语言模型，并为不同用户集群学习特定的参数集合。

Result: 实验表明：1）使用页面级分词器的小型模型优于大型预训练或微调模型；2）考虑异质性的HeTLM在相同参数量下优于单一模型；3）该方法实现了更高的平均性能和更低的方差，提升了用户级别的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 针对用户主观浏览行为，小型专业化模型比大型通用模型更有效，考虑用户异质性的训练方法能够显著提升模型性能和对齐质量。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，使用基于训练数据影响力的模型中心难度指标（而非传统人为定义的难度）进行课程学习，能够使语言模型预训练效果提升10个百分点以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，研究者希望探索是否使用更符合模型训练过程中实际观察到的难度指标能够改善这一状况

Method: 使用训练数据影响力（training data influence）作为难度指标对训练样本进行排序，构建从简单到复杂的课程学习顺序

Result: 采用模型中心难度指标的课程学习方法在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的效果提升了超过10个百分点

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练确实有益，但关键在于采用模型中心的难度概念而非传统的人类中心难度指标

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Motivation: 小型语言模型(SLMs)具有计算效率和可访问性优势，但缺乏对其性能和环境影响系统性评估的基准测试。

Method: 开发SLM-Bench基准测试，在4种硬件配置下评估15个SLM在9个NLP任务上的表现，使用23个数据集覆盖14个领域，量化11个正确性、计算和能耗指标。

Result: 评估结果显示不同SLM之间存在多样化权衡，一些模型在准确性方面表现出色，而另一些模型在能源效率方面更优。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，弥合了资源效率与实际应用之间的差距，提供了开源基准测试流程以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，使用希伯来语调优的大语言模型获得最佳性能（F1=0.74），并用于分析精英话语与公众身份优先级的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社会身份检测数据集主要是英语中心、单标签且关注粗粒度身份类别，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中 nuanced 社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建包含5536个句子的希伯来语多标签语料库，手动标注12种基于调查数据的细粒度社会身份，使用多标签和单标签编码器以及2B-9B参数生成式LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM表现最佳（宏观F1=0.74），应用分类器分析政客Facebook帖子和议会演讲，发现身份表达的流行度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关差异。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，揭示了精英话语与公众身份优先级之间的差异。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Conclusion: Dream 7B代表了扩散语言建模的重要进展，发布的Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct模型将促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在过去30年显著上升，社交媒体中更常见，右翼政治人物使用更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)的自动分析可行性，通过大规模计算研究理解民主话语中的规范性攻击模式。

Method: 构建包含10,410个句子的希伯来语语料库，手动标注1,812个PDD实例；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM。

Result: 最佳模型(DictaLM 2.0)在二元PDD检测中F1得分0.74，在去合法化特征分类中macro-F1得分0.67；发现PDD在过去30年显著上升，社交媒体比议会辩论更常见，右翼政治人物使用更多。

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，能够揭示政治话语中的规范性攻击模式及其随时间、平台和政治倾向的变化趋势。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow首次实现了完全自动化的基准构建流程，提供了全面的安全基准，验证了系统的有效性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力远强于作为生成器防御攻击的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究对齐模型的判别和生成能力

Method: 提出SDGO强化学习框架，利用模型自身判别能力作为奖励信号进行迭代自我优化，无需额外标注数据或外部模型

Result: SDGO显著提升模型安全性，优于基于提示和训练的基线方法，在通用基准上保持有用性，对分布外越狱攻击具有鲁棒性能

Conclusion: 通过对齐判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，仅需少量判别样本即可进一步增强生成能力，为LLM安全提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个通过位置到位置知识蒸馏来缓解长文本处理中位置偏差的框架，包含专门针对检索和推理任务的两种实现方式，显著提升了不同位置的处理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差严重影响长文本理解能力，现有方法通过修改架构来缓解但效果有限，需要更有效的方法来减少不同位置间的性能差距。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill知识蒸馏框架，将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置，设计了针对检索(Pos2Distill-R¹)和推理(Pos2Distill-R²)的两种专门实现。

Result: 该方法在所有上下文位置都实现了更好的均匀性和显著性能提升，两种专门系统在各自任务上表现优异且具有跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill通过利用位置诱导的差异来对抗位置偏差，有效解决了长文本处理中的位置敏感性问题，在检索和推理任务中都取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第七大语言，在数字化领域表现不足，词干提取对这种资源稀缺的语言至关重要，能大大简化语言分析算法的复杂性。

Method: 进行了孜加拉语词干提取方法的综述性调查研究，分析了现有研究的间断性和可复现性问题，并批判了评估指标系统。

Result: 发现孜加拉语词干提取领域存在显著的研究空白，现有研究之间缺乏连续性，实现代码难以获得，评估方法不适用于该语言的丰富形态特征。

Conclusion: 建议开发更健壮的孜加拉语词干提取器，并继续深入研究以提升语言分析和处理能力，应对该语言复杂的形态和多样的方言挑战。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集在规模和设计上有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解能力，还是可能引入冗余或降低性能

Method: 构建EcomMMMU数据集（406,190样本，8,989,510图像），包含8个核心任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性地使用多张图像进行下游任务

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低表现，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容方面存在困难；SUMEI方法在综合实验中显示出有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 电商多模态理解需要更智能的图像选择策略，SUMEI通过数据驱动的方法有效解决了多图像利用问题，为MLLMs在电商领域的应用提供了重要见解

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

Motivation: 医学大语言模型在诊断中存在知识鸿沟和幻觉问题，现有检索增强方法对外部知识利用不足且缺乏反馈-推理可追溯性，需要开发更有效的诊断辅助系统。

Method: 构建大规模医学检索语料库（患者记录和可靠医学知识源），将LLM作为核心代理，检索语料库作为环境，通过强化学习使用格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性等多维度奖励进行端到端训练。

Result: 在多个数据中心超越提示工程和无训练RAG方法，诊断准确性显著优于GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1等强基线模型，在常见和罕见疾病诊断中均表现出色，且在分布内外设置下均有效。

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch通过强化学习驱动的代理RAG框架有效解决了医学诊断中的知识鸿沟和幻觉问题，奖励设计和检索语料库组件对性能提升至关重要，为临床医生提供了更可靠精确的初步诊断支持。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算方面仍有不足。工具集成推理(TIR)通过整合外部工具来改进推理，但其泛化效果和对模型推理行为的实际影响尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖9个不同推理类别，并设计了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估表明，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中均优于非TIR模型，TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考，使推理更加精简高效。

Conclusion: TIR具有领域通用的优势，有潜力提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的能力，通过整合外部工具可以显著改善模型的推理表现和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 虽然MCP为工具集成提供了标准化框架，但在动态真实场景中评估AI代理使用多种MCP工具解决多步骤任务的能力存在显著差距。

Method: 通过迭代LLM重写和人工审查精心策划101个真实查询，引入基于真实执行计划而非原始API输出的新颖评估方法，更好地反映真实环境的动态特性。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably

Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这种长期选择，认为这不是实现高性能的唯一途径。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了Soft-argmax的使用，提供了不同的端到端训练方法。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准数据集上达到最先进性能，训练收敛速度比传统方法快2.2倍，同时保持更好/竞争性的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax不是面部关键点检测中实现高性能的唯一方法，结构化预测框架提供了有效的替代方案，具有更快的训练速度和竞争性的精度。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限，需要一种能够更好建模关系数据的方法来提升图像分类性能，特别是在处理复杂场景和细粒度类别时。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Voronoi图和对应的Delaunay三角剖分来优化图表示，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类准确率改进，超越了最先进的方法，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新颖的视角，扩展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的仅RGB解决方案来直接学习类别级别的9自由度姿态估计。

Method: YOPO是一个基于查询的单阶段框架，在transformer检测器基础上增加了轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，仅使用RGB图像和类别级别姿态标签进行端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越了所有先前的RGB-only方法，并大幅缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了检测和9自由度姿态估计可以统一实现高性能，无需额外数据，为机器人学和自动化提供了更简洁有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for

Conclusion: TAIGen在保持视觉质量的同时实现了高效的对抗攻击，是最具影响力的攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB双域进行可逆建模，并使用针对性扩散模型优化不确定区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVP方法主要局限于掩码域的可逆策略，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在不足

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题并展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE模块（掩码域可逆建模）、CARE模块（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE模块（针对性Bernoulli扩散模型细化）

Result: 通过可逆网络提供强不确定性先验，使扩散模型能高效聚焦模糊区域，显著减少假阳性和假阴性

Conclusion: RUN++提出了构建鲁棒CVP系统的新范式，在真实退化条件下保持有效性，并扩展为更广泛的双层优化框架

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，在文本到图像生成中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型基于线性轨迹，强制零曲率可能迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，需要探索轨迹曲率与语义对齐之间的关系。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，通过曲率正则化技术直接在学习流路径中融入曲率指导，惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成中达到最先进性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量，证实了曲率指导对提升语义对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出分层排序和质量对齐框架，结合排序学习和对比学习。使用高阶排序损失监督质量预测，嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致，并通过结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量级变体HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA框架通过自监督学习实现了强大的泛化能力和可扩展性，为无参考图像质量评估提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于实时部署场景。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型的纹理生成问题，实现了高质量、风格一致的3D场景合成，为虚拟城市应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Motivation: 手术部位感染(SSI)是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，目前缺乏公开的手术伤口数据集和开源筛查工具，深度学习应用受到数据隐私和专家标注成本高的限制。

Method: 1) 创建SurgWound数据集，包含697张手术伤口图像和8个精细临床属性标注；2) 建立包含视觉问答和报告生成任务的基准测试；3) 提出三阶段框架WoundQwen：第一阶段用5个独立MLLM预测伤口特征，第二阶段用2个MLLM进行感染风险评估，第三阶段整合前两阶段结果生成综合报告。

Conclusion: 该研究为个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后铺平了道路，解决了手术伤口筛查中的数据隐私和标注成本问题。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Conclusion: STAGNet模型为基于单一视频输入的事故预测提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的泛化能力和实用价值

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协同多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 使用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Conclusion: TriMM证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的有效性，并为整合其他多模态数据集到3D生成中提供了可行性验证

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过软原型计算和双重一致性学习有效解决了类间冲突和原型漂移问题，提高了聚类性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，可以直接绕过扩散模型生成过程中的多个中间去噪步骤，实现高效采样，且该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中达到SOTA效果，但其顺序生成过程需要多步迭代，效率较低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，允许在迭代生成过程中绕过多个中间去噪步骤，而不是传统的逐步细化。该方法从与标准扩散模型相同的训练目标推导而来，表明通过马尔可夫方式的加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能够以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样是一种有效的加速扩散模型采样的方法，它证明了加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在能力，并且可以与DDIM等现有方法结合进一步提升生成效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Motivation: 传统图像编解码器编码模式有限且依赖工程师手动选择，对非专业用户不友好，需要更智能的交互式压缩解决方案。

Method: 提出三方面创新：1)多功能编码框架统一不同目标需求的编码模式；2)基于增强上下文学习的交互编码代理；3)首个专用评估基准IIC-bench。

Result: Comp-X能高效理解编码请求，具备出色的文本交互能力，在单一编码框架下保持可比的压缩性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像压缩中的人工通用智能提供了有前景的发展方向，实现了智能化的用户交互体验。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配结果进行监督，导致监督范围有限，拓扑推理性能不佳。

Method: 重构Transformer解码器结构，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序，保留冗余车道预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，显著提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富且几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，提升了车道拓扑推理的整体性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

TL;DR: TPA是一个用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的框架，结合了时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心功能评估任务上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在图像噪声、探头位置变异性问题，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时序信息、仅限于二分类且缺乏预测校准，需要开发更可靠的自动化诊断方法。

Method: 提出时序提示对齐(TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习：1)图像编码器提取视频片段帧特征；2)可训练时序提取器聚合特征捕捉心脏运动；3)通过边界铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别特定文本提示；4)引入条件变分自编码器风格调制模块(CVAESM)学习潜在风格向量调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: 在CHD检测私有数据集上达到85.40%的宏F1分数，预期校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%；在EchoNet-Dynamic三分类任务上宏F1提升4.73%(从53.89%到58.62%)。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的准确性和临床可靠性，为自动化心脏诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Method: 构建BasketLiDAR数据集（包含4,445帧和3,105个球员ID），开发基于LiDAR高精度3D空间信息的新型MOT算法，包括纯LiDAR实时跟踪管道和LiDAR-摄像头融合的多模态跟踪管道

Result: 方法实现了实时操作（传统纯摄像头方法难以实现），在遮挡条件下仍能保持优异的跟踪性能

Conclusion: BasketLiDAR数据集和提出的多模态跟踪框架解决了篮球运动实时3D轨迹跟踪的挑战，为体育分析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

TL;DR: RAG-SEG是一种无需训练的两阶段伪装目标检测方法，首先使用检索增强生成(RAG)产生粗掩膜作为提示，然后通过SAM2进行精细分割，在个人笔记本上实现与SOTA方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法需要大量训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示且未经微调时性能不佳。手动生成提示成本高且效率低。

Method: 提出RAG-SEG两阶段范式：1)通过无监督聚类构建紧凑检索数据库进行特征检索生成粗掩膜提示；2)使用SAM2基于检索到的特征生成伪标签进行精细分割。整个过程无需传统训练。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上的大量实验表明，RAG-SEG性能与或超过最先进方法，所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，证明了计算效率和实用性。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效伪装目标检测解决方案，通过检索增强生成和SAM分割的结合，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型的安全和伦理问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence

of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和计算成本高。深度学习模型计算需求大，需要更高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 采用进化算法识别需要微调的层集合，选择性微调相关层而不是全部参数，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上评估，相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法，BioTune实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 通过集中微调相关层子集，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性以及跨场景共享码本，将3DGS压缩到KB级别，同时支持基于图像的场景更新解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到MB级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制。

Method: 使用图像条件化的高斯分布量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，采用跨训练场景共享的固定码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练。

Result: 实验结果表明ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降至KB级别同时保持视觉保真度。

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了3DGS的压缩效率并提供了归档后场景变化的适应能力，解决了现有方法的两个关键限制。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，专门针对驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督来解决现有方法的几何表示不准确问题。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景中快速移动物体和大规模静态背景的3D重建挑战，实现了高质量的场景重建和新视角渲染。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在抽象推理方面的根本瓶颈，通过Raven渐进矩阵问题作为权威基准来评估和提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计DIO基线模型，然后针对互信息最大化目标的局限性提出了三种渐进改进方法。

Conclusion: 需要超越传统的互信息最大化方法，通过提出的三种改进方法来更好地捕捉RPM任务中的因果关系和推理逻辑。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 短视频内容兴起需要高效的关键信息提取技术，但现有方法难以捕捉全局时序依赖、保持语义连贯性，且多通道特征融合易受噪声影响

Method: 基于脉冲神经网络的关键帧提取器，动态聚合图推理器解耦上下文对象一致性和语义连贯性，变分推理重建模块使用ELBO优化处理多通道特征融合的不确定性和噪声

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum、QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过SNN的事件驱动机制和变分推理有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和语义连贯性，同时降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MAE在视觉基础模型中表现出色，但在应用于新数据集时需要大量超参数调优，且MAE超参数与下游任务性能之间的关系研究相对不足。

Method: 通过分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，并扩展到非线性MAE，研究MAE表示如何适应数据集中的空间相关性。

Result: 研究发现掩码比例和补丁大小可以控制MAE学习短程和长程空间相关性特征，MAE表示能够适应超越二阶统计量的数据集空间相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，揭示了MAE学习空间相关性的机制。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Conclusion: 提出的双向时间信息传播方法有效解决了滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，为该任务提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了极稀疏视图下的3D场景重建问题，无需SfM初始化，在渲染质量和几何结构重建方面均表现出色

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习解决多模态图像融合中的模态不对齐、高频细节破坏等问题，在多个融合任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像融合面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合方法

Method: 采用自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，结合空间-频率Mamba块实现跨域融合，动态调整可学习映射

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务中表现出优越的融合性能，计算成本低且网络紧凑

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为多模态图像融合提供了有效的通用解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的框架，结合几何和生成先验，通过创新的高斯表示和自监督不确定性估计，显著提升外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法利用生成先验作为伪地面实况，但往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种更有效的轨迹外推解决方案。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的道路表面高斯(RSG)表示、使用可学习缩放因子的远场高斯(FFG)，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为模拟驾驶场景提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程处理多对象交互和复杂运动，解决了现有方法的时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。第一阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；第二阶段使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识，包含上下文条件特征增强(CCFE)等模块提升时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成复杂多对象草图的高质量、时间一致动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法有效扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，能够处理复杂的多对象交互场景。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个针对高分辨率遥感图像中狭窄道路提取的深度学习网络，通过差分注意力机制和双流解码融合，在复杂场景下实现了精细道路结构分割的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 狭窄道路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过度拟合通用道路宽度，无法有效处理精细、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征；2）双流解码融合机制平衡空间精度和语义上下文；3）多尺度扩张策略减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中精细狭窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类条件似然，结合CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类条件特征分布的显式建模，导致决策边界不可靠和预测校准不足。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类条件似然。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正潜在似然偏差。无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种分布偏移下实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT提供了一种有效的无反向传播测试时自适应解决方案，通过概率建模和轻量正则化实现了可靠的分布偏移适应，为实时部署和实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两阶段训练策略解决INR频谱偏差问题：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码对高频细节像素加权，第二阶段全图像训练，有效提升重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INR)存在频谱偏差问题，神经网络倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 两阶段训练策略：1)使用邻域感知软掩码自适应为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注细节；2)过渡到全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法持续改善重建质量，并能与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 现有的半定规划松弛方法求解截断最小二乘配准问题需要数百秒，计算效率低下，需要更快速的全局最优求解方法。

Method: 采用线性时间凸松弛和contractor方法来加速分支定界算法，在给定旋转轴的情况下求解点云配准问题。

Result: 能够在0.5秒内求解100个点的3D点云配准问题，比STRIDE SDP求解器快两个数量级，并提供全局最优性证明。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准问题的求解效率，虽然目前仅限于旋转轴已知的情况，但在计算速度方面取得了重大突破。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Motivation: 理解野生动物和人类活动的空间分布对于评估人兽互动和制定有效保护规划至关重要，需要多视角监测方法来识别活动区域重叠和冲突程度。

Method: 在尼泊尔奇特旺国家公园及周边区域，使用可见光/近红外相机陷阱和热红外无人机收集图像，构建深度学习模型（YOLOv11s和增强版Faster RCNN）进行自动识别，并进行空间模式分析。

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时间潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，解决了现有视频LLM在时间感知和实体对齐方面的局限性，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得了显著进展，但在时间感知方面仍然粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码，帧级特征在捕捉连续性方面较弱，语言视觉对齐经常偏离感兴趣的实体。

Method: 提出了三个关键创新：1）扩散时间潜在（DTL）编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2）对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3）混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，验证了模型的强大接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过创新的时间编码、实体对齐和显式时间建模设计，显著提升了视频LLM的时间感知精度和实体定位能力。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据的树实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但面临数据变化大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，由人类操作员进行质量评级，训练评分模型分类分割输出，最后用评分模型反馈微调分割模型

Result: 原始分割模型的正确识别树实例数量提高了34%，同时显著减少了非树实例的预测数量

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏林区和小树（低于2米）或复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中性能仍有限，这些区域容易将非树物体误认为树

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Method: 基于关键特征一致性观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以保证不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下表现出色

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD通过创新的知识蒸馏框架成功实现了从多模态模型到轻量级视觉模型的有效知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线高精地图构建解决方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Conclusion: 这项研究推进了自动化LoD3模型重建的发展，为可扩展和高效的3D城市建模打开了途径

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建跨五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩KV缓存，在长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem机制，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉标记和通用查询标记之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时保持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法相竞争。

Conclusion: StreamMem为内存受限的长视频场景提供了一种高效的流式视频理解解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长视频生成中的时间一致性和结构漂移问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的结构漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割方面存在挑战，特别是在识别特定细胞亚型方面。需要开发能够利用分子信息并减少标注需求的新方法。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）分子赋能的标注参与减少像素级标注需求；2）通过SAM适配器调整模型以关注特定语义；3）整合分子导向校正学习（MOCL）提升分割精度。

Result: 在内部和公共数据集上的实验表明，All-in-SAM模型显著提高了细胞分类性能，即使在标注质量不同的情况下也能保持良好表现。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个从60万高分辨率扫描中学习的高保真人体模型，通过将网格表示基于人体骨骼来显式解耦形状和骨骼基，解决了现有方法在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且传统方法中内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系。

Method: 从600k高分辨率扫描数据学习，使用240个同步相机捕获。显式解耦形状和骨骼基，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体方面更准确，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: 该方法通过骨骼基础的显式解耦实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及与外部软组织特性无关的关键点拟合，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

TL;DR: VAREdit是一个基于视觉自回归模型的图像编辑框架，通过将图像编辑重构为多尺度预测问题，解决了扩散模型在指令引导编辑中的全局纠缠问题，实现了更精确的编辑效果和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在指令引导图像编辑中存在全局去噪过程导致编辑区域与整个图像上下文纠缠的问题，会产生意外的伪修改和编辑指令遵循度不足。自回归模型通过序列化合成过程提供了不同的范式，能够自然避免扩散方法的这些问题。

Method: 提出VAREdit框架，将图像编辑重构为下一尺度预测问题。基于源图像特征和文本指令生成多尺度目标特征。引入尺度对齐参考(SAR)模块，在第一个自注意力层注入尺度匹配的条件信息，解决细粒度源特征无法有效指导粗粒度目标特征预测的问题。

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归范式和多尺度预测方法，显著提升了图像编辑的精确度和效率，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在保证样本质量的同时最大化组多样性，显著改善了生成模型输出集的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。实际应用中用户通常需要一组多样化且高质量的图像选择。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式候选集剪枝提高运行效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。框架可泛化到文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该方法使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更好的多样化输出选择。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的关键障碍，为预训练模型的高分辨率生成能力提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

TL;DR: 本文首次解决了空间范围连接随机采样问题，提出了一个时间和空间高效的算法，相比基线方法在大多数测试中显著更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间范围连接在GIS、LBS等应用中很常见，但计算成本高且结果集过大。返回随机样本是实用的解决方案，但高效计算随机样本而不执行完整连接具有挑战性。

Method: 首先设计两个使用现有随机采样技术的基线算法，然后提出新的数据结构，在期望时间O(n+m+t)和空间O(n+m)内解决问题。

Result: 在四个真实空间数据集上的广泛实验表明，该算法在大多数测试中比基线方法显著更快。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了空间范围连接的随机采样问题，为相关应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information
systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and
visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but
also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating
these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is
promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins,
efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must
obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this
challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and
space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ
existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient.
Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in
$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are
the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We
conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in
most tests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图中凝聚子图查询对于理解真实网络的动态结构至关重要，但现有算法OTCD由于区间枚举的组合增长和重复处理而存在可扩展性限制

Method: CoreT算法动态记录每个顶点或边进入k-core的最早时间戳，从而大幅剪枝冗余计算，只需单次遍历查询区间

Result: 实验结果表明CoreT在大型真实数据集上比OTCD快4个数量级，时间复杂性与查询区间内的时序边数和区间长度呈线性关系

Conclusion: CoreT算法具有高度可扩展性，适用于长期时序分析，为时序k-core分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding
the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in
social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient
communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the
temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all
possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art
algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals
by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time
intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the
combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this
paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel
algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each
vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of
redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the
query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both
the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the
interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.
Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up
to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art
OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core
analysis.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL展示了显著的性能提升和实际可用性，为处理文本到SQL中的查询歧义提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Abstract: In cloud-edge-device (CED) collaborative query (CQ) processing, by leveraging
CED collaboration, the advantages of both cloud computing and edge resources
can be fully integrated. However, it is difficult to implement collaborative
operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query
execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when
the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query
execution between the cloud and edge, we propose a CQ processing method by
establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan
operator, so that query execution can be transferred to the cloud at any time
when the edge resources are saturated. Extensive experiments show that, under
sufficient network download bandwidth, the CED collaborative scan operator can
effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by
high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge. It also achieves balanced resource
scheduling between the cloud and edge.

TL;DR: Gorgeous系统通过优先处理图结构而非向量数据，优化内存缓存和磁盘块格式，显著提升向量搜索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SSD的向量搜索系统存在数据布局不佳问题，无法有效利用内存空间减少磁盘访问，且磁盘数据访问局部性差。研究发现图结构索引比向量本身访问更频繁，但现有系统未区分两者

Method: 设计Gorgeous系统，采用图结构优先原则：1）内存缓存保留图节点邻接表以提高缓存命中率；2）磁盘块格式显式存储邻居邻接表与向量以增强数据局部性

Result: 实验显示Gorgeous持续优于两种最先进的基于磁盘的向量搜索系统，平均查询吞吐量提升超过60%，查询延迟降低超过35%

Conclusion: 通过优先处理图结构索引并优化数据布局，Gorgeous系统能有效提升大规模向量搜索的性能和效率

Abstract: Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a
key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce
costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a
proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the
state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered
by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory
space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing
disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the
structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the
vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two. To
address this problem, we design the Gorgeous system with the principle of
prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a
memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache
hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists
along with a vector to enhance data locality. Experimental results show that
Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for
vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query
latency by over 35%.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GoVector是一种针对磁盘图索引的I/O高效缓存策略，通过静态缓存和动态缓存结合，以及磁盘节点重排序，显著减少I/O操作并提升查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态缓存策略在初始导航阶段有效，但在需要动态访问查询相关节点的第二阶段失效，导致I/O成为主要瓶颈，占查询延迟90%以上。

Method: 结合静态缓存（存储入口点和频繁访问邻居）和动态缓存（自适应捕获第二阶段具有高空间局部性的节点），并通过磁盘节点重排序使相似向量共置同一或相邻页面。

Result: 在90%召回率下，平均减少46%的I/O操作，查询吞吐量提升1.73倍，查询延迟降低42%。

Conclusion: GoVector通过创新的缓存策略和存储布局优化，有效解决了磁盘图索引的I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了大规模近似最近邻搜索的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution
for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their
substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where
frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the
dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static
caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by
preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second
phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high
recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for
disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores
entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that
adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search
phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,
GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the
same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves
substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations
by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query
latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

TL;DR: Databelt是一个面向3D计算连续体动态环境的无服务器工作流状态管理框架，通过SLO感知状态传播和函数状态融合机制，显著降低状态访问延迟和网络开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无服务器函数在3D计算连续体动态环境中依赖远程存储服务导致的高延迟、网络通信开销大以及网络拓扑频繁变化带来的挑战

Method: 1. SLO感知状态传播机制：主动将函数状态卸载到最合适的节点，使数据在执行节点或附近就位；2. 函数状态融合机制：为共享同一运行时的函数抽象状态管理，减少冗余网络和存储操作

Result: 工作流执行时间减少高达66%，吞吐量提高50%；函数状态融合使存储操作延迟降低高达20%

Conclusion: Databelt在高度动态的网络环境中有效提升了无服务器工作流的执行效率，通过智能状态管理和融合机制解决了3D计算连续体中的状态访问挑战

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

TL;DR: 本文证明了在LUMI模型和顺序调度器下，无需传统舞蹈问题中的约束条件即可解决通用舞蹈问题，即机器人可以从任意初始配置执行任意模式序列


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明舞蹈问题需要模式重复性、周期性、对称性等严格约束才能解决。本文旨在证明通过LUMI模型（带有限颜色灯光的机器人）和顺序调度器，可以消除这些必要约束

Method: 采用LUMI模型，机器人配备有限颜色调色板的灯光，在顺序调度器下工作。利用顺序机器人的分布式计数器机制实现算法，即使是非刚性移动也能确保空间同质性

Result: 证明了在LUMI模型下，可行舞蹈序列的长度受限于可用颜色数量的组合。提供了解决通用舞蹈问题的算法，该算法能够从任意初始配置执行任意模式序列

Conclusion: LUMI模型和顺序调度器的结合使得通用舞蹈问题得以解决，突破了传统舞蹈问题的约束限制，为机器人编舞提供了新的可能性

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文针对同步消息传递系统中的k-set agreement问题，在任意有向通信网络和最多t个进程崩溃的情况下，提出了新的下界结果，推广了先前在完全网络和特定网络模型中的多个下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的k-set agreement下界主要针对完全网络或特定网络模型，缺乏对任意有向通信网络和进程崩溃情况的通用下界分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供更一般化的理论结果。

Method: 采用拓扑证明方法，基于一系列可壳化的载波映射，从可壳化的输入复形出发，分析协议复形的演化过程。在前t/k轮使用每轮崩溃k个进程的载波映射，之后采用新颖的载波映射保持高连通性，并运用Sperner引理风格的论证。

Result: 成功推导出在任意有向通信网络中k-set agreement的新下界，推广了多个现有结果。同时证明了可以使用基于Kuhn三角化的指数级更小的输入复形替代传统的输入伪球面复形。

Conclusion: 本文提出的拓扑证明方法有效推广了完全网络情况下的连通性方法，为任意通信网络中的k-set agreement问题提供了统一的理论框架和更紧的下界结果。

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无服务器环境中，工作流中的函数可能被调度到不同节点，这些节点拥有不同的缓存，这会导致非直观的异常现象。现有缓存方案无法很好地处理客户端在多服务器间漫游的情况。

Method: 提出了CausalMesh系统，采用因果一致性缓存协议，支持无协调和无中止的读写操作，并支持读写事务。系统在Dafny中进行了形式化验证。

Result: 实验评估显示，CausalMesh相比现有方案具有更低的延迟和更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: CausalMesh是第一个支持客户端在多服务器间漫游时无协调、无中止操作的缓存系统，为无服务器计算环境提供了有效的因果一致性缓存解决方案。

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Motivation: 地下无线传感器网络(WUSNs)在远程、灾难地区和难以达区域面临持续性挑战，需要新的网络架构来支持大规模机器类通信。

Method: 提出SAGUIN架构，整合卫星系统、空中平台、地面网络和地下通信，并集成LoRaWAN和无线能量传输技术。通过模拟远程地下管道监测场景评估系统性能。

Result: 结果显示SAGUIN系统结合适当的时间分配策略和SF配置，能够有效延长地下设备的运行寿命，实现持续的地下大规模机器类通信。

Conclusion: SAGUIN架构为地下无线传感器网络提供了可行的解决方案，但仍面临多项技术挑战，需要进一步研究完善。

Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing
and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold
great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across
various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce
network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face
significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type
communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and
hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel
space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that
seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial
networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN
and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable
sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical
background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of
SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline
monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based
on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as
underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF)
configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results
evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time
allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the
operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean
mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for
SAGUIN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着QUIC协议的快速采用和5G网络的普及，高清视频流媒体变得可行。然而，在移动网络中优化用户体验质量(QoE)仍面临挑战，需要统一考虑应用层ABR方案、传输层减寂控制算法和链路层RLC排队的复杂交互。

Method: 进行了全面的分析，重点研究现代AQM策略(如RED和L4S)在多样化QUIC实现中对视频流媒体的影响，特别关注它们与5G环境中RLC缓冲的交互以及CC算法与ABR方案之间的相互作用。

Result: 研究结果显示，AQM策略在改善视频流媒体QoE方面的效果与它们与QUIC实现、CC算法和ABR方案的动态交互密切相关，单独的优化方案是不充分的。

Conclusion: 这种复杂的相互依存关系必须要求整体性的、跨层适配机制，能够实现网络、传输和应用层之间的实时协调，以充分发挥5G网络的能力，提供稳健、适配性和高质量的视频流媒体服务。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of QUIC as a transport protocol has transformed content
delivery by reducing latency, enhancing congestion control (CC), and enabling
more efficient multiplexing. With the advent of 5G networks, which support
ultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and
beyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of
Experience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex
interactions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC
algorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the
link layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these
components in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the
impact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S,
on video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations--focusing particularly on
their interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay
between CC algorithms and ABR schemes. Our findings demonstrate that the
effectiveness of AQM strategies in improving video streaming QoE is
intrinsically linked to their dynamic interaction with QUIC implementations, CC
algorithms and ABR schemes-highlighting that isolated optimizations are
insufficient. This intricate interdependence necessitates holistic, cross-layer
adaptive mechanisms capable of real-time coordination between network,
transport and application layers, which are crucial for fully leveraging the
capabilities of 5G networks to deliver robust, adaptive, and high-quality video
streaming.

Abstract: Future communication networks are expected to achieve deep integration of
communication, sensing, and computation, forming a tightly coupled and
autonomously operating infrastructure system. However, current reliance on
centralized control, static design, and human intervention continues to
constrain the multidimensional evolution of network functions and applications,
limiting adaptability and resilience in large-scale, layered, and complex
environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
nature-inspired architectural framework that leverages digital twin technology
to organize connected devices at the edge into functional digital populations,
while enabling the emergence of an evolvable digital ecosystem through
multi-population integration at the cloud. We believe that this framework,
which combines engineering methodologies with sociotechnical insights, lays the
theoretical foundation for building next-generation communication networks with
dynamic coordination, distributed decision-making, continuous adaptation, and
evolutionary capabilities.

Abstract: The network structure design plays a vital role in the mega-constellation
network (MSN) to coordinate massive network nodes to ensure the effectiveness
and reliability of operations and services for future space wireless
communications networks.
  One of the critical issues in MCN is how to design an optimal network control
structure by configuring the most stable inter-satellite link (ISL) to achieve
high available MCN within a limited average transmission delays.
  To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel MCN structure design
paradigm: Structure = Motif + Lattice (SML), which decouples MCN design into
local motifs design and global lattices design. Specifically, we formulate the
High-Availability and Low-Latency Mega-Constellation Design (HALLMD) problem,
aimed at maximizing ISL availability while minimizing the transmission latency.
To solve HALLMD, we propose SMLOP, a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds
optimal network structures in polynomial time. Experimental validation on four

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于动态生成网络功能间的控制接口，解决传统标准化接口的兼容性和适应性不足问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标准化网络接口存在厂商不兼容、设计假设僵化、缺乏新功能适应性等显著限制，需要更灵活的接口生成方案

Method: 使用多智能体框架：匹配智能体对齐控制功能需求与网络功能能力，代码生成智能体生成必要的API服务器实现接口

Result: 在多厂商gNB和WLAN AP模拟环境中验证，性能评估显示不同LLM在接口生成任务中的成本与延迟权衡

Conclusion: 为AI原生动态控制接口生成奠定基础，为未来移动网络增强互操作性和适应性开辟道路

Abstract: Traditional standardized network interfaces face significant limitations,
including vendor-specific incompatibilities, rigid design assumptions, and lack
of adaptability for new functionalities. We propose a multi-agent framework
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate control interfaces on
demand between network functions (NFs). This includes a matching agent, which
aligns required control functionalities with NF capabilities, and a
code-generation agent, which generates the necessary API server for interface
realization. We validate our approach using simulated multi-vendor gNB and WLAN
AP environments. The performance evaluations highlight the trade-offs between
cost and latency across LLMs for interface generation tasks. Our work sets the
foundation for AI-native dynamic control interface generation, paving the way
for enhanced interoperability and adaptability in future mobile networks.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的同态形式计算法，用于验证和反驳用户定义聚合函数是否满足同态形性质，以支持高效的并行执行和增量计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Apache Spark和Flink等数据处理框架支持用户定义聚合函数，但要实现高效执行，函数必须满足同态形性质。这个问题鼗使研究者开发能够自动验证和构建合并运算符的方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的同态形式计算法，可以验证和反驳UDAF是否为数据框同态形。如果满足条件，计算法还能构建相应的合并运算符。实现了基于该计算法的算法。

Result: 在真实世界的UDAF上评估了该方法，证明其性能显著超过了两个领先的合成器。

Conclusion: 该同态形式计算法为验证和构建高效聚合函数提供了有效的解决方案，能够支持数据处理框架的并行执行咏增量计算。

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

TL;DR: GPS是一种新的软件模型检测算法，结合了静态分析和测试生成，通过两层搜索策略高效发现程序错误，并在SV-COMP基准测试中优于现有最先进工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件模型检测工具在处理包含长输入依赖错误路径的程序时效率不高，需要一种既能证明安全性又能发现反例的高效算法

Method: GPS采用组合式基于摘要的静态分析来指导程序状态的有向搜索，使用静态分析摘要剪除不可行路径并驱动测试生成，引入新的两层搜索策略和插装技术实现反驳完备性

Result: 在SV-COMP和先前文献的基准测试中，GPS在解决基准数量和运行时间方面都优于最先进的软件模型检测器（包括SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops类别的顶级工具）

Conclusion: GPS通过结合静态分析和测试生成的新颖方法，在保持高性能的同时实现了反驳完备性，显著提升了软件模型检测的效率

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为big-stop语义的扩展方法，通过引入归纳定义来捕获小步语义中的发散计算，同时保持大步语义的简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大步语义虽然简洁易用，但无法描述程序发散行为；小步语义虽然功能强大但过于繁琐。需要一种既能保持大步语义简洁性又能捕获发散计算的解决方案。

Method: 在标准大步语义推理规则基础上，添加少量额外规则来定义评估判断，该判断等价于小步转移的自反传递闭包。

Result: 提出的big-stop语义能够处理类型化、非类型化和带效应的PCF变体，以及基于while循环的命令式语言中的发散计算。

Conclusion: big-stop语义提供了一种简洁的解决方案，既保持了大步语义的易用性，又获得了小步语义的表达能力，避免了其他方法引入的复杂性和不常用推理原则。

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

TL;DR: Praline是一个新的Datalog扩展，用于处理输入事实间存在统计相关性时的精确概率推理，通过约束优化和δ-精确推理算法提供可扩展的紧致概率边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率逻辑编程语言（如ProbLog）在评估输出关系概率时未考虑输入事实间的统计相关性，这限制了推理的精确性。

Method: 将推理任务建模为约束优化问题，提出δ-精确推理算法，结合约束求解、静态分析和迭代优化来解决可扩展性问题。

Result: 在包括侧信道分析在内的真实基准测试中，该方法不仅具有良好可扩展性，还能提供紧致的概率边界。

Conclusion: Praline通过处理输入相关性并采用高效推理算法，实现了在复杂程序中精确且可扩展的概率推理。

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Core ECS形式化模型，抽象ECS模式的本质，识别出一类确定性并发程序，并发现现有ECS框架未能充分利用确定性并发机会


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECS模式在游戏开发中广泛使用但外部领域了解不足，现有解释过于具体或模糊，需要建立严谨的形式化理解

Method: 设计Core ECS形式化模型，抽象实现细节，识别确定性行为程序类，并调研多个真实ECS框架进行比较分析

Result: 发现所有调研的ECS框架都未能充分利用确定性并发机会，存在改进空间

Conclusion: 研究指出了新的ECS实现技术方向，可以更好地利用确定性并发机会，为构建确定性并发编程模型提供基础

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

Motivation: 主动对象系统作为分布式计算模型，具有并发性和资源感知特性，需要开发资源感知的形式化方法来模建分布式系统和业务流程工作流。

Method: 结合顺序程序中已经成熟的分级语义学和类型系统技术，以及同步会话中开发的公平终止技术，构建了一种核心计算法。

Result: 开发出了一种资源感知的主动对象核心计算法，并通过类型系统确保良构程序能够完全终止。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将顺序程序的资源感知形式化技术与并发系统的公平终止性要求相结合，为建模分布式系统提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有组合符号执行工具虽然利用分离逻辑进行验证和错误发现，但缺乏对内存模型参数化的满意形式化基础，限制了平台的灵活性和适用范围。

Method: 基于Gillian平台的启发，在Rocq交互式定理证明器中机械化形式化基础，并实例化到多种内存模型（包括C和CHERI），同时支持分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为内存模型参数化组合符号执行提供了坚实的形式化基础，增强了平台的灵活性、语言支持范围和性能优化能力。

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在纯符号程序合成中有效，但在神经符号程序合成中由于神经网络组件的误预测问题，经常返回错误的程序，需要新的技术来处理这一挑战。

Method: 提出了约束一致性评估(CCE)方法，考虑神经误预测和用户反馈，通过迭代优化CCE精度直到所有剩余程序保证观察等价性。

Result: 在三个神经符号领域测试，SmartLabel在98%的基准测试中识别出真实程序，平均需要不到5轮用户交互，而先前技术最多只能达到65%的准确率。

Conclusion: SmartLabel有效解决了神经符号程序合成中的主动学习挑战，显著提高了程序合成的准确性和用户交互效率。

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个全面的自动化程序修复(APR)工具评估框架，并以Sorald工具为例进行评估，发现虽然能修复特定规则违规，但会引入新故障、降低功能正确性和代码结构质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估APR工具清除违规的能力，忽视了其可能引入新违规、改变代码功能和降低代码结构质量的问题，需要开发全面的评估框架。

Method: 以Sorald工具为概念验证，评估其在2,393个Java代码片段中修复3,529个SonarQube违规的效果，涵盖30条规则。

Result: Sorald修复了特定规则违规，但引入了2,120个新故障(32个bug，2,088个代码异味)，单元测试失败率达24%，代码结构质量下降。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够捕捉APR工具全方位影响的评估方法，包括副作用，以确保其安全有效的应用。

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是代码理解任务中有效的模型压缩技术，特征蒸馏方法最具潜力，教师-学生架构相似性并非性能提升的关键因素

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

Result: 建立了完整的LLM研究指南框架，包括研究类型分类和具体实施标准，为社区提供了可用的在线资源(llm-guidelines.org)。

Conclusion: 这些指南能够帮助研究者在面对LLM特有的开放科学障碍时，仍然能够实现研究的可复现性和可复制性，为社区提供了重要的方法论指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

*Markus Borg,Martin Larsson,Philip Breid,Nadim Hagatulah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: QUPER-MAn模型将可维护性从被忽视的开发后果转变为主动管理的目标，通过基准测试和目标设定来支持需求工程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可维护性在软件开发中至关重要但常被忽视，需求工程可以通过促进讨论和设定适当目标来解决这个问题

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了QUPER-MAn模型（QUPER模型的可维护性适配版），整合可维护性基准并支持目标设定

Result: 研究发现可维护性仍然是次要的质量关注点，明确的需求通常只泛泛提及编码规范，工具提供的可维护性代理指标通常只用于与工程实践相关的隐式需求

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn模型可以将可维护性从被忽视的开发后果转变为由知情和负责任的工程决策驱动的主动管理目标

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

TL;DR: VERMEI是一种测试FPGA逻辑综合工具的新方法，通过识别僵尸逻辑、等效变异和差分测试来发现工具缺陷，在5个月内发现了15个bug


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA逻辑综合工具存在缺陷可能导致意外行为和安全隐患，现有测试方法生成的测试程序语义和逻辑复杂性不足

Method: 包含三个模块：预处理模块通过仿真和覆盖率分析识别僵尸逻辑；等效变异模块通过贝叶斯采样从历史设计中提取逻辑片段，在僵尸区域修剪或插入逻辑来生成等效变体；bug识别模块基于差分测试比较种子程序和变体程序的综合输出

Result: 在Yosys、Vivado和Quartus上的实验表明VERMEI优于最先进方法，5个月内向厂商报告了15个bug，其中9个被确认为新bug

Conclusion: VERMEI通过生成具有复杂控制流和结构的测试程序，有效提升了FPGA逻辑综合工具的测试效果

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

TL;DR: 本研究通过行动研究在IT公司建立技术债务管理流程，发现实践者偏好基于系统演化和成本计算的债务偿还优先级，并通过待办事项提醒机制可持续提升技术债务意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术债务管理在研究中频繁讨论但实践中很少采用，本研究旨在基于预定义的工作坊概念在IT公司建立可持续的技术债务管理流程。

Method: 采用行动研究方法（16个月内5个行动周期），通过问卷分析、团队会议观察、TD-SAGAT心理学方法和待办事项数据分析来检验技术债务意识。

Result: 实践者偏好偿还低悬果实的技术债务，待办事项中的提醒机制（如复选框和文本模板）可持续提升技术债务意识。

Conclusion: 基于工作坊的方法是可行的并能带来可持续的流程改变，产生了适用于其他IT团队的新技术债务管理思路，如重新提交日期、TD讨论复选框和可视化优先级排序。

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

Fincantieri. Our results show how to integrate anomaly detection with
troubleshooting procedures. We conclude by discussing a lesson learned, which
may help deploy and extend these analyses to other industrial products.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该论文研究具有组结构的面板数据模型，分析了最小二乘估计量的渐近行为和信息准则，特别关注小规模组的存在对估计和模型选择的影响，并提出了改进的信息准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在处理包含小规模组的面板数据模型时，最小二乘估计量的渐近性质和组数选择的信息准则可能表现不佳，需要开发能够有效处理小规模组的方法。

Method: 推导最小二乘估计量的一致性和渐近正态性的充分条件，分析现有信息准则在小规模组存在时的局限性，提出改进的信息准则(MIC)，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟和实证应用验证其性能。

Result: 证明了最小二乘估计量在特定条件下的渐近性质，发现现有信息准则在小规模组存在时可能不一致或表现差，提出的MIC准则在有限样本中表现良好，能够有效识别小规模组。

Conclusion: 改进的信息准则MIC能够有效处理面板数据中的小规模组问题，结合K-means聚类可以实现简约的组结构识别，既能发现小规模组又能避免产生过多组别。

Abstract: We consider panel data models with group structure. We study the asymptotic
behavior of least-squares estimators and information criterion for the number
of groups, allowing for the presence of small groups that have an
asymptotically negligible relative size. Our contributions are threefold.
First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the least-squares estimators
are consistent and asymptotically normal. One of the conditions implies that a
longer sample period is required as there are smaller groups. Second, we show
that information criteria for the number of groups proposed in earlier works
can be inconsistent or perform poorly in the presence of small groups. Third,
we propose modified information criteria (MIC) designed to perform well in the
presence of small groups. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms their good
performance in finite samples. An empirical application illustrates that
K-means clustering paired with the proposed MIC allows one to discover small
groups without producing too many groups. This enables characterizing small
groups and differentiating them from the other large groups in a parsimonious
group structure.

TL;DR: 提出基于多元分布函数的新多元分位数回归框架MQR，通过条件概率结构定义分位数，使用序列单变量分位数回归构建多元分位数曲线，具有良好的理论性质和实证应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多元分位数回归方法（如方向分位数、向量分位数回归、copula方法等）存在局限性，需要一种基于条件概率结构、具有直观解释和灵活边际效应估计的新框架。

Method: 通过条件机制推导的序列单变量分位数回归来构建多元分位数曲线，基于联合条件分布函数的条件概率结构定义分位数。

Result: 理论建立了MQR的渐近性质，模拟显示在不同依赖结构下具有稳健的有限样本性能，在阿根廷汇率传递实证分析中得到成功应用。

Conclusion: MQR框架为多元分位数回归提供了新的有效方法，具有理论严谨性、计算可行性和实证应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for multivariate quantile regression
based on the multivariate distribution function, termed multivariate quantile
regression (MQR). In contrast to existing approaches--such as directional
quantiles, vector quantile regression, or copula-based methods--MQR defines
quantiles through the conditional probability structure of the joint
conditional distribution function. The method constructs multivariate quantile
curves using sequential univariate quantile regressions derived from
conditioning mechanisms, allowing for an intuitive interpretation and flexible
estimation of marginal effects. The paper develops theoretical foundations of
MQR, including asymptotic properties of the estimators. Through simulation
exercises, the estimator demonstrates robust finite sample performance across
different dependence structures. As an empirical application, the MQR framework
is applied to the analysis of exchange rate pass-through in Argentina from 2004
to 2024.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究环保创新与盈余管理之间的关系，探讨企业在环境倡议背景下进行收入平滑的战略动机。

Method: 采用多方法稳健方法解决内生性和选择偏误问题，包括熵平衡、倾向得分匹配（PSM）和赫克曼检验校正。

Result: 环保创新与盈余管理呈正相关，财务约束（低Whited-Wu分数和弱销售表现）和财务不透明企业更倾向于进行盈余管理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了环保创新的双重战略作用——在可持续性信号传递和盈余管理之间取得平衡，为监管机构、投资者和政策制定者提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Our research investigates the relationship between eco-innovation and
earnings management among 567 firms listed on the FTSE All-Share Index from
2014 to 2022. By examining how sustainability-driven innovation influences
financial reporting practices, we explore the strategic motivations behind
income smoothing in firms engaged in environmental initiatives. The findings
reveal a positive association between eco-innovation and earnings management,
suggesting that firms may leverage ecoinnovation not only for environmental
signalling but also to project financial stability and meet stakeholder
expectations. The analysis further uncovers that the propensity for earnings
management is amplified in firms facing financial constraints, proxied by low
Whited-Wu (WW) scores and weak sales performance, and in those characterised by
high financial opacity. We employ a robust multi-method approach to address
potential endogeneity and selection bias, including entropy balancing,
propensity score matching (PSM), and the Heckman Test correction. Our research
contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the dual
strategic role of ecoinnovation -balancing sustainability signalling with
earnings management, under varying financial conditions. The findings offer
actionable insights for regulators, investors, and policymakers navigating the
intersection of corporate transparency, financial health, and environmental
responsibility.

Abstract: There is a projected increase in offshore wind energy generation in the
United States over the next three decades, driven by legislative commitments
and government funding. Like other renewable technologies, the construction of
offshore wind farms has environmental impacts and spillover effects that must
be assessed. Developing offshore wind as a reliable domestic energy source
requires a multiregional analysis of economic and environmental effects of
constructing projects along lakefronts and coastal regions. Although no
commercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven
states have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035. This
study evaluates the spatial economic and environmental impacts of planned
projects by linking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Offshore
Renewables Balance-of-system Installation Tool (ORBIT) with a multiregional
input-output model of the U.S. economy developed in the Virtual Industrial
Ecology Lab. ORBIT provides capital investment requirements for installation,
which are combined with the model to estimate economic spillover effects.
Environmental impacts are assessed using a newly developed multiregional
greenhouse gas emissions dataset for the U.S. to capture supply chain emissions
of offshore wind construction. The five projects analyzed require 16.3 billion
dollars in capital investment and generate 27.6 billion dollars in direct and
indirect economic impacts across the country. Emissions results show that
states active in energy generation are most affected, but impacts can be
reduced by decarbonizing the grid. A carbon payback analysis indicates the
projects offset construction-phase emissions in less than a year. The framework
highlights which states experience the greatest spillover effects in terms of
emissions and economic activity required to support offshore wind expansion.

### [1] [Initial Steps in Integrating Large Reasoning and Action Models for Service Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18775)
*Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型推理模型（LRM）和大型动作模型（LAM）的框架，以解决服务组合中的语义推理和执行问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务组合在构建自适应和智能软件系统中面临挑战，现有方法在推理能力和执行机制上存在不足。

Method: 提出集成LRM和LAM的架构框架，LRM负责语义推理，LAM负责动态执行。

Result: 该框架能够自动化服务组合，弥合意图与执行之间的差距。

Conclusion: LRM-LAM集成有望将服务组合转变为完全自动化、用户友好的过程。

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

### [2] [Simulation-Driven Reinforcement Learning in Queuing Network Routing Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18795)
*Fatima Al-Ani,Molly Wang,Jevon Charles,Aaron Ong,Joshua Forday,Vinayak Modi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟驱动的强化学习框架（Dyna-DDPG），用于优化复杂排队网络中的路由决策，适用于制造和通信领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统排队方法在动态和不确定环境中表现不佳，需要一种更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 结合Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient（DDPG）和Dyna-style规划（Dyna-DDPG），并开发了灵活的模拟环境。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能快速学习有效的路由策略，在干扰下保持稳健性能，并可扩展至更大网络。

Conclusion: 该框架具有实际部署潜力，且通过良好的软件工程实践确保了可重现性和可维护性。

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [3] [A Neuroscience-Inspired Dual-Process Model of Compositional Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18868)
*Alex Noviello,Claas Beger,Jacob Groner,Kevin Ellis,Weinan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE框架通过模拟人脑的HPC-PFC交互机制，实现了系统性组合泛化，在SCAN基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统在系统性组合泛化上的核心挑战，借鉴人脑的HPC-PFC机制。

Method: MIRAGE包含两个模块：Transformer Neural Decomposer（类似新皮质的直觉模式识别）和Schema Engine（类似HPC-PFC的推理循环），通过迭代分解和模式应用实现泛化。

Result: 在SCAN基准测试中准确率>99%，Transformer模块仅1.19M参数。

Conclusion: MIRAGE的系统性依赖于模式提取质量和迭代优化过程，为组合泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

### [4] [Success in Humanoid Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18883)
*Wuhao Wang,Zhiyong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 首次在部分可观测条件下成功训练人形机器人策略，性能接近全状态访问的先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在部分可观测条件下训练高维任务（如人形机器人行走）的挑战。

Method: 提出一种新型历史编码器，处理固定长度的过去观测序列，集成到无模型算法中。

Result: 策略性能与全状态基线相当，仅需原始状态的三分之一至三分之二，且能适应机器人属性变化。

Conclusion: 历史编码器通过重构上下文信息实现鲁棒决策，为部分可观测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

### [5] [Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18977)
*Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri,Ryan A. Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Kanak Mahadik,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Mohammad Rostami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对时序知识图谱（TKG）的增量训练框架，解决训练中未观察或稀疏连接的实体问题，结合模型无关的增强层和加权采样策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TKG补全模型假设训练时可访问整个图谱，忽略了图谱动态演变的挑战，如新知识的泛化和稀疏连接实体的管理。

Method: 采用模型无关的增强层（基于全局实体相似性）和加权采样策略（突出稀疏实体边），可增强现有TKG补全方法。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，框架在总链接预测、归纳链接预测及长尾实体处理上优于现有方法，MRR提升15%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解灾难性遗忘，增强了TKG补全方法的鲁棒性，特别适用于增量训练场景。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

### [6] [Fine-Grained Traffic Inference from Road to Lane via Spatio-Temporal Graph Node Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19089)
*Shuhao Li,Weidong Yang,Yue Cui,Xiaoxing Liu,Lingkai Meng,Lipeng Ma,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI)任务，通过有限的道路数据生成更详细的车道级交通信息，并设计了RoadDiff框架来解决该任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道级交通数据获取困难，限制了数据驱动模型的应用，因此需要一种更高效、低成本的方法来精确管理交通。

Method: 设计了RoadDiff框架，包括Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder和Lane Diffusion Module，利用有限的时空依赖性和数据分布关系推断车道交通状态。

Result: 在六个不同道路条件下的数据集上验证了RoadDiff模型的有效性。

Conclusion: RoadDiff为解决FRTI任务提供了一种高效且成本较低的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

### [7] [Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109)
*Noé Lallouet,Tristan Cazenave,Cyrille Enderli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pareto-NRPA是一种新的蒙特卡洛算法，用于离散搜索空间的多目标优化问题，扩展了单目标问题的NRPA算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将单目标优化的NRPA算法扩展到多目标优化领域，解决多目标问题中的搜索和策略更新挑战。

Method: 通过一组策略同时探索解空间的不同区域，并在每个搜索层级维护非支配前沿，策略更新基于帕累托前沿的多样性和隔离性。

Result: 在MO-TSPTW问题和神经网络架构搜索任务中，Pareto-NRPA表现优异，尤其在受限搜索空间中优于现有进化多目标算法。

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA是NRPA算法在多目标优化中的首次成功扩展，具有竞争性的收敛性和多样性表现。

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OS-MAP是一个用于评估日常计算机自动化任务的基准，通过五级分类和需求层次结构分析代理能力与用户需求的匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能考虑任务异质性和代理能力与用户需求的匹配，阻碍了能力开发和实际部署。

Method: OS-MAP通过五级自动化分类和需求层次结构评估代理能力，形成性能-泛化评估矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的代理在涉及感知、推理和协调的高级任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: OS-MAP为计算机代理的研究和部署提供了结构化评估工具，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,
environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at

*Jiyao Wang,Xiao Yang,Qingyong Hu,Jiankai Tang,Can Liu,Dengbo He,Yuntao Wang,Yingcong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysDrive是一个大规模多模态数据集，专注于无接触车内生理监测，填补了现有数据集的不足，为驾驶安全和用户体验研究提供了重要资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程生理测量（RPM）数据集在规模、多样性和实际驾驶条件覆盖上存在不足，限制了其在真实驾驶场景中的应用。

Method: PhysDrive收集了48名驾驶员的多模态数据，包括RGB、近红外摄像头和毫米波雷达数据，并同步了六种生理信号作为真实值。

Result: 数据集覆盖了多种自然驾驶条件，并通过信号处理和深度学习方法进行了全面评估，建立了多模态基准。

Conclusion: PhysDrive将成为多模态驾驶员监测和智能座舱系统研究的基础资源，推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

### [10] [Faster Lifting for Ordered Domains with Predecessor Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19182)
*Kuncheng Zou,Jiahao Mai,Yonggang Zhang,Yuyi Wang,Ondřej Kuželka,Yuanhong Wang,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新算法，直接在公理中处理前驱关系，显著提升了有序域上推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理有序域上的前驱关系时效率低下，尤其是涉及前驱关系时。

Method: 将前驱关系作为公理的一部分，设计了一种新算法，支持直接处理前驱关系。

Result: 新算法在实验中对前驱关系推理任务和组合数学问题实现了数量级的加速。

Conclusion: 该算法不仅提升了已知可处理的前驱关系效率，还能处理更一般的k阶前驱关系。

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

*Osama Almurshed,Ashish Kaushal,Asmail Muftah,Nitin Auluck,Omer Rana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为知识嫁接的新方法，通过将大模型的部分特征移植到小模型中，显著减小模型大小并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在资源受限环境中因模型过大和计算需求高而难以部署的问题。

Method: 引入知识嫁接机制，将大模型（供体）的选定特征（接穗）移植到小模型（砧木）中。

Result: 模型大小减少88.54%，验证准确率提升至89.97%，测试准确率达90.45%，验证损失降低。

Conclusion: 知识嫁接有效解决了模型大小与性能的权衡问题，适用于资源受限设备，可推广至边缘计算场景。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

### [12] [Modeling Uncertainty: Constraint-Based Belief States in Imperfect-Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19263)
*Achille Morenville,Éric Piette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了在不完全信息游戏中，通过约束满足问题和概率扩展（信念传播）两种方法表示信念，发现约束方法效果接近概率方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完全信息游戏中基于部分知识决策的挑战，减少游戏特定推理逻辑的需求。

Method: 使用约束满足问题和信念传播两种方法表示隐藏棋子身份的信念。

Result: 约束方法与概率方法在代理性能上差异微小，效果相当。

Conclusion: 约束信念状态可能足以支持有效决策。

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从计算社会科学的角度分析LLMs在模拟人类认知和社会行为中的潜力与不足。

Result: LLMs在交互式模拟中具有直接价值，但在解释性或预测性建模中存在局限性。

Conclusion: 建议将LLMs与传统基于规则的建模平台结合，以兼顾灵活性与透明度。

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

### [16] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Specification Self-Correction (SSC)的框架，用于帮助语言模型在推理时识别并修正自身指导规范中的缺陷，从而减少对错误规范的利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易利用有缺陷的规范（如评分标准）来获取高分，而忽略用户的真实意图。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了SSC框架。

Method: SSC采用多步推理过程：模型首先生成基于潜在缺陷规范的响应，随后对其输出进行批判，并修正规范以消除漏洞，最后生成更鲁棒的响应。

Result: 实验表明，SSC将模型利用缺陷规范的漏洞比例从50-70%降低至90%以上，且无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: SSC框架在推理时动态修复规范缺陷，显著提升了模型行为的鲁棒性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AS-RoBERTa模型针对阿拉伯文字语言优化，通过语言特定的预训练，在分类任务中表现优于通用多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言模型在共享文字但文化和正字法不同的语言（如库尔德语、阿拉伯语、波斯语和乌尔都语）中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 开发了四种基于RoBERTa的模型，每种针对特定语言进行预训练，专注于文字特征和统计信息。

Result: AS-RoBERTa在分类任务中比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa高出2-5个百分点。

Conclusion: 文字感知的预训练对阿拉伯文字语言至关重要，支持进一步研究基于文字和语言特性的预训练策略。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种多语言文本去毒解决方案，结合词典引导标注、微调序列到序列模型和迭代分类器门控机制，在PAN-2025竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言文本去毒任务，提升去毒精度和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 整合词典引导标注、微调序列到序列模型（s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo）和迭代分类器门控机制。

Result: 最高STA得分0.922，平均J得分0.612，xCOMET得分0.793（开发集）和0.787（测试集），优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 模型在多语言环境下表现优异，尽管在SIM指标上有所权衡，但去毒效果显著提升。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

TL;DR: 论文评估了大语言模型（LLMs）在多语言混合（code-mixing）任务中的表现，并提出了一种基于GPT-4提示的合成混合文本生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试（如LinCE和GLUECoS）在多语言混合任务中表现有限，且缺乏对LLMs能力的全面评估。

Method: 对18种语言的混合数据进行了全面评估，并提出了一种结合单词替换和GPT-4提示的合成混合文本生成方法。

Result: LLMs在多语言混合数据集上表现不佳，尤其是在涉及多种语系时。

Conclusion: 建议通过增加训练数据规模、模型规模和few-shot学习来提升LLMs在多语言混合任务中的表现。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

TL;DR: CueBuddy提供实时词汇提示，帮助非英语母语学生理解STEM课程中的技术术语，而不干扰课堂注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球南方STEM学生因英语技术术语理解困难而落后，尽管其科学基础与英语流利同学相当。

Method: 通过实时技术关键词识别和多语言术语查询，提供实时词汇提示。

Result: CueBuddy帮助学生跟上复杂英语术语，同时保持课堂专注。

Conclusion: 该方法有效但存在局限性，未来需进一步扩展。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在检索到混淆性半相关段落或需要深度推理时的不足。

Method: 提出PrismRAG框架，训练模型处理干扰性QA对，并培养推理习惯。

Result: 在12个开放书RAG QA基准测试中，平均事实准确性提升5.4%。

Conclusion: PrismRAG优于现有方法，显著提升RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于意图的对话系统难以处理动态多轮交互，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 结合工具增强的演示构建和奖励条件数据建模，利用LLMs和强化学习优化对话生成。

Result: 在真实电商对话中，MindFlow+在上下文相关性、灵活性和任务准确性上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs、工具推理和奖励引导学习，可构建领域专业化、上下文感知的对话系统。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG是一种新的贝叶斯模型，通过结合标注者背景信息，从人工标注数据中去除噪声，同时保留系统性分歧。实验表明，NUTMEG在恢复真实标注方面优于传统聚合方法，且下游模型性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设标注分歧是错误，但实际可能是真实分歧。需要区分噪声和信号。

Method: 提出NUTMEG模型，利用标注者背景信息去除噪声，保留系统性分歧。

Result: NUTMEG在合成数据中表现优于传统方法，下游模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 在人工标注数据训练中，需同时考虑标注者能力和系统性分歧。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估社会科学论文的可重复性对研究严谨性至关重要，但手动评估成本高。AI代理的潜力尚未被充分挖掘，现有基准存在局限性。

Method: 引入REPRO-Bench，包含112个任务实例，每个实例基于公开的论文和复现报告，评估AI代理的可重复性评估能力。

Result: 现有AI代理在REPRO-Bench上最高准确率仅为21.4%，而REPRO-Agent将准确率提高了71%。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的AI代理以自动化真实世界的可重复性评估，REPRO-Bench已公开。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）仅支持少数语言，且现有词典提示方法成本高。需要一种灵活的方法在翻译性能和令牌消耗间取得平衡。

Method: 提出SLoW方法，自动选择低频词典以增强翻译，无需训练数据或额外调整LLMs。

Result: 在FLORES的100种语言上，SLoW超越基线方法，显著节省令牌且翻译性能优于全词典基线。

Conclusion: SLoW是一种高效、灵活的词典选择方法，适用于多语言翻译任务，无需依赖训练数据。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖简短、字面的网络数据，缺乏对创意输出的理解能力。

Method: 通过挖掘图像中显著视觉元素的上下文关联，生成不同抽象程度的创意标题。

Result: 生成了包含170万创意标题的新数据集，并在零样本图像-文本检索任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了创意领域的视觉语言模型性能，并公开了数据集和模型。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

TL;DR: 多语言大语言模型（LLM）在跨语言泛化中表现优异，但中低资源语言在常见基准测试中表现不佳。通过分析Gemma-2-2B的激活模式，发现中低资源语言在早期和深层激活中存在显著差距。采用LoRA进行激活感知微调后，激活显著提升，同时保持英语性能，基准测试结果有所改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中低资源语言在多语言LLM中表现不佳的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析Gemma-2-2B的激活模式，并采用LoRA进行激活感知微调。

Result: 中低资源语言激活显著提升（如马拉雅拉姆语87.69%，印地语86.32%），基准测试结果一致改善。

Conclusion: 激活对齐是提升多语言LLM性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

Motivation: 现有MMT方法在双语场景表现良好，但在多语言翻译中面临跨语言干扰和参数共享策略无效的挑战。

Method: 提出层选择机制和神经元级适应策略，动态选择语言特定和无关神经元，提升翻译质量。

Result: 在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上取得SOTA结果，仅微调40%参数。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT为多模态多语言翻译提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，并揭示了层和神经元选择的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing

professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights
promising technology-driven strategies that can significantly alter workflow
dynamics within the legal sector, emphasizing the role of automation in

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于比较对话动态相似性的度量方法，并验证其鲁棒性，最终应用于分析在线社区中的对话动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对对话整体动态的自动化比较，限制了对话数据的分析和对话代理的全面评估。

Method: 设计了一种对话动态相似性度量方法，并构建验证框架测试其鲁棒性和对话题的敏感性。

Result: 度量方法能够有效捕捉对话动态差异，并在在线社区分析中揭示了情境权力在对话中的作用。

Conclusion: 该方法为对话动态分析提供了新工具，有助于更全面地评估对话质量和代理性能。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG框架通过多工具聚合提升LLM在复杂数学推理中的性能，无需微调即可应用于各种LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有工具增强方法在复杂多步数学推理中的局限性。

Method: Multi-TAG框架，指导LLM在每一步推理中并发调用多个工具并聚合结果。

Result: 在四个基准测试中平均提升6.0%至7.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG是一种高效、通用的工具增强框架，显著提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单次生成，缺乏对事实修正或结构优化的支持，Arg-LLaDA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合灵活的掩码控制器和充分性检查模块，通过迭代的掩码和再生改进摘要。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，Arg-LLaDA在10项自动评估指标中有7项超越现有方法，人类评估也显示其在覆盖性、忠实性和简洁性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA的迭代生成策略有效提升了论点摘要的质量。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

Conclusion: DebateCV为复杂声明验证提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: GEPA是一种基于自然语言反思的提示优化器，通过分析系统级轨迹和语言反馈，显著提升LLM任务性能，优于GRPO和MIPROv2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法（如GRPO）需要大量rollouts，而语言的可解释性可能提供更丰富的学习媒介。

Method: GEPA通过自然语言反思诊断问题、提出并测试提示更新，结合Pareto前沿的互补经验。

Result: GEPA在四个任务中平均优于GRPO 10%，最多20%，且rollouts减少35倍；优于MIPROv2 10%。

Conclusion: GEPA展示了高效利用少量rollouts实现显著性能提升的潜力，适用于代码优化等任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Motivation: 现有主题质量评估方法（如连贯性和词入侵）未考虑主题对语料库探索的实用性，需基于任务和用户群体设计新评估方法。

Method: 通过用户研究，分析用户对主题的解释方式，采用反思性主题分析从用户评估理由中提取主题解释模式。

Result: 用户基于可用性和代表性启发式解释主题，而非概率；提出锚定调整启发式理论解释用户如何从显著词出发进行语义调整。

Conclusion: 主题解释是生态理性用户在不确定性下的判断行为，需开发考虑认知偏差的用户模型和评估框架。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其可能强化刻板印象和生成偏见内容的问题引发担忧，尤其是在非英语语言中。

Method: 通过结构化实验方法，使用意大利语设计涉及三种职业组合的无性别提示，测试ChatGPT和Gemini两种模型的3600条回答。

Result: 结果显示模型显著强化性别偏见，如Gemini将100%的“她”代词与“助理”而非“经理”关联。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发缓解策略以确保AI系统减少社会不平等，未来可扩展至更多语言或模型。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

Motivation: 探讨方言差异（AAVE与SAE）与数据污染如何共同影响大型语言模型输出的毒性，揭示模型中的社会偏见问题。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLaMA模型，结合数据污染实验，并通过GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具分析输出中的有害模式。

Result: AAVE输入的毒性显著增加，且模型规模越大，放大效应越强；GPT-4o发现AAVE输入中更多有害刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究强调了方言偏见与数据污染的叠加效应，呼吁开发中需关注方言感知评估、针对性去偏干预和社会责任训练。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法同时保证可复现性、透明性和高效性，且高估程度未量化。

Method: 提出ArxivRoll框架，包含SCP（自动生成私密测试用例）和Rugged Scores（量化污染和训练偏差）。

Result: 实验证明框架生成高质量基准，并对当前LLMs进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll有效解决了评估中的高估问题，提升了评估的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Result: PAD在四种LLDMs上实现97%的越狱成功率，且LLDMs的有害生成速度是LLMs的两倍。

Conclusion: LLDMs存在显著安全风险，需进一步研究其架构以确保安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

Result: 微调的RoBERTa模型表现最佳，指令调优的LLMs在跨领域数据上更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLMs在民粹主义话语分析中存在局限性，但指令调优模型在跨领域应用中表现更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: AutoPCR具有归纳能力和对新本体的泛化能力。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环大语言模型因其固定大小的内存限制，在长上下文任务中表现不佳，而现有方法未能解决这一问题。

Method: Smooth Reading方法受人类阅读策略启发，分块处理上下文并迭代总结信息，减少内存需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将循环大语言模型的性能从低于自注意力模型5.68%提升至高于3.61%，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading首次实现了循环大语言模型在长上下文任务中与自注意力模型相当的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，时间戳对齐显著提升SER准确性，优于未同步的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间戳对齐对多模态情感分析至关重要，为提升情感识别准确性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于语音的智商（SIQ）评估框架，用于评估语音理解大语言模型（LLM Voice）的能力，超越了传统的词错误率（WER）指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音理解评估指标（如WER）未能全面反映模型的认知能力，因此需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: SIQ基于Bloom分类法，从三个认知层次评估模型：记忆（WER）、理解（解释相似性）和应用（问答准确性）。

Result: SIQ不仅能量化语音理解能力，还能统一比较级联方法和端到端模型，发现现有基准中的标注错误和模型幻觉。

Conclusion: SIQ是首个将认知原则与语音导向基准结合的智能评估框架，揭示了多模态训练中被忽视的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种全自动方法生成带有语法错误和不流畅性的音频-文本对，并设计了一系列客观指标评估生成数据，以选择更适合SGEC的数据集。目标是生成增强数据集，保持原始数据的文本和声学特征，同时提供新类型的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏高质量的标注口语数据集用于口语语法错误纠正（SGEC），因此需要一种方法生成此类数据以支持研究。

Method: 提出全自动方法生成音频-文本对，并设计客观指标评估数据质量。实验基于S&I语料库进行。

Result: 生成的增强数据集在保持原始数据特征的同时，为SGEC和书面GEC提供了新的错误类型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成适用于SGEC的高质量数据，且不改变L2学习者的语言评估分数。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为荷兰临床自由文本中的ADE检测设定基准，评估不同模型的表现。

Method: 使用Bi-LSTM和四种Transformer模型（BERTje、RobBERT、MedRoBERTa.nl、NuNER）进行命名实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC），基于102份荷兰ICU临床记录。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl在ADE RC任务中表现最佳，宏平均F1分数为0.63（黄金标准）和0.62（预测实体），外部验证召回率为0.67-0.74。

Conclusion: 研究提供了评估临床自由文本中ADE检测的稳健方法，强调了适合任务和临床用途的性能指标的重要性。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗文本嵌入模型存在数据覆盖窄、方法过时以及评估不足的问题，无法满足实际医疗任务的需求。

Method: 利用MEDTE模型，通过自监督对比学习在多样化医疗语料上进行微调，并设计了一个包含51个任务的医疗文本评估基准。

Result: 该方法不仅建立了稳健的评估框架，还在多项任务中优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 结合MEDTE模型和定制化评估基准，显著提升了医疗文本嵌入的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨数据集适应问题，参数效率高，性能接近最优。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Conclusion: 改进的单次联邦学习框架在医疗领域高效且隐私安全，适用于非独立同分布数据。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了仅依赖几何信息的人体网格语义分割。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADAS系统依赖昂贵传感器，而基于机器学习的低成本替代方案存在安全漏洞，尤其是物体检测器的脆弱性。

Method: 提出ShrinkBox攻击方法，通过修改训练数据中的边界框尺寸，影响YOLOv9m物体检测器的输出，进而破坏距离估计。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，攻击成功率高达96%，仅需4%的毒化比例，且下游距离估计的平均绝对误差增加了3倍以上。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击揭示了ML-ADAS系统的安全隐患，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

Motivation: 传统集中式学习存在隐私风险，而分散式方法如联邦学习和群体学习虽保护隐私，但面临数据异构性、效率低下和灾难性遗忘等问题。

Method: 提出VGS-ATD框架，支持分布式节点上的模型训练，避免频繁通信和权重聚合。

Result: 在30个数据集和80个独立标签的实验中，VGS-ATD实现了92.7%的准确率，优于集中式学习（84.9%）和群体学习（72.99%），并减少了50%的计算成本。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD在隐私保护、效率和可扩展性方面表现优异，适合动态复杂的临床环境。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: 基础模型在嫌疑人素描生成中表现最稳健，但微调方法在特定指标上有潜力。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不稳定，但提出的噪声增强方法提高了分类准确性和模型信心。

Conclusion: 讨论了CLIP在临床领域的应用挑战，并提出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无负载心脏几何形状是个性化生物力学建模的关键参考，但传统方法计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略，结合生物物理先验，实现双向预测和部分自监督。

Result: 在20,700个有限元模拟上测试，HeartUnloadNet达到亚毫米精度，推理时间仅为0.02秒，比传统方法快10^5倍。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet为传统逆有限元求解器提供了可扩展且准确的替代方案，支持实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

Motivation: 解决现有NeRF和3DGS方法在训练和渲染速度、多传感器支持及互操作性上的局限性。

Method: SaLF使用稀疏的3D体素基元表示体积，每个体素为局部隐式场，支持自适应修剪和密集化。

Result: SaLF训练快（<30分钟），渲染高效（相机50+FPS，LiDAR 600+FPS），支持非针孔相机和旋转LiDAR。

Conclusion: SaLF在保持真实感的同时提升了效率和功能，适用于更广泛的自动驾驶传感器模拟。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

Conclusion: SAR-Text和SAR-Narrator为SAR图像的语义理解提供了有效工具，并具有扩展潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Conclusion: Human Gaussian Graph通过跨帧信息整合，显著提升了可动画人体建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a

modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上分别实现了17.4%和21.0%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 提出的PV-ASR方法通过音素和LLM的结合，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在白盒设置下表现良好，但在迁移性和对抗防御机制方面表现不足。

Result: 实验表明MAT-Adv在迁移性和不可防御性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAT-Adv通过扰动MAT表示有效提升了对抗攻击的性能。

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 3D几何先验有效缩小了模态差距，提升了平面图自定位的准确性。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

Motivation: 解决红外图像目标检测中因模态差异导致的分布偏移问题，提升模型在跨模态和干扰条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出WiSE-OD方法，包括两种变体：WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$（结合RGB零样本和IR微调权重）和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$（结合零样本和线性探测）。

Result: WiSE-OD在不增加训练或推理成本的情况下，显著提升了跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WiSE-OD方法有效解决了红外目标检测中的模态差异问题，为跨模态鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGHFT显著优于现有方法，F1和准确率分别提升5.4%和4.0%。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过多视角文本引导的视觉语义融合，实现了更精细的贴图情感识别。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD)的新任务，通过结合合成数据和未标注真实数据，利用循环学习框架（CSRDA）提升模型在真实场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据收集和标注成本高，伪装目标检测（COD）的数据集较少，尤其是某些特殊类别。合成数据可以缓解数据不足问题，但直接使用合成数据训练会导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA)，基于师生模型，通过伪标签和一致性正则化将类别信息从标注的源域传播到未标注的目标域，并利用循环学习框架缩小域内差距。

Result: 大量实验证明CSRDA框架有效缓解了COD中数据不足和手工标注的问题。

Conclusion: CSRDA框架通过结合合成与真实数据，显著提升了模型在真实场景中的性能，为COD任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Conclusion: YOLOv8是水下污染检测和清理的有效工具，具有高检测能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection
capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.

Conclusion: HQ-SMem通过创新方法显著提升了VOS模型的性能，尤其在复杂场景和长视频中表现突出。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

TL;DR: GSSR提出了一种新方法，通过均匀分布高斯并优化几何对齐，显著提升了3D高斯重建的几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法（如3DGS和PGSR）在几何重建上存在不足，高斯分布不均匀且偏离潜在表面，导致重建和编辑困难。

Method: GSSR结合像素级和高斯级的单视角法线一致性以及多视角光度一致性，优化高斯分布和法线对齐，并通过不透明度正则化和周期性重新初始化进一步优化。

Result: 实验表明，GSSR显著提高了高斯分布的几何精度，同时保持了高质量的渲染性能。

Conclusion: GSSR为高斯重建提供了更精确的几何表示，支持直观的场景编辑和高效的新视图生成。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually
annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice
assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA
and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: GR-CLIP有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了混合模态搜索的性能。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

Conclusion: PDT框架能够捕捉几何和语义特征，为需要结构化点分布的各种3D几何处理任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we

periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark

proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by

experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a

TL;DR: PatchTraj是一种动态基于补丁的轨迹预测框架，结合时域和频域表示，通过多尺度分割和跨模态注意力提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模人体运动动力学和时频交互方面存在不足，无法平衡局部细节与长程依赖关系。

Method: 将轨迹分解为时域和频域表示，采用动态补丁分割和多尺度特征提取，通过跨模态注意力融合时频谱线索。

Result: 在ETH-UCY、SDD、NBA和JRDB数据集上实现了最先进的性能和高效率。

Conclusion: PatchTraj通过统一时频表示和多尺度建模，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种深度学习模型（YOLO-v11、YOLO-World和YOLO-Classification）在真实世界车辆图像数据集上的性能，通过多视角推理（MVI）提升模型预测效果，结果表明目标检测模型在车辆属性提取上优于分类模型，且小模型性能接近大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别车辆属性（如品牌、颜色和形状）对执法和情报应用至关重要，研究旨在评估深度学习模型在复杂真实场景中的表现。

Method: 使用包含10万张以上图像的数据集，分别针对品牌、形状和颜色任务训练模型，并通过MVI和多组实验（包括不同模型大小）进行分析。

Result: 最佳模型在品牌、形状、颜色和颜色二分类任务上的准确率分别为93.70%、82.86%、85.19%和94.86%，目标检测模型表现优于分类模型。

Conclusion: MVI是处理复杂真实数据的关键，小模型在效率上有显著优势，为车辆元数据提取提供了可靠基线。

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好考虑，LOTUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOTUS通过多维度评估（如描述质量、风险和偏见）并结合用户偏好，对大型视觉语言模型进行综合评估。

Result: 分析显示，没有单一模型在所有标准上表现优异，且描述细节与偏见风险相关。用户偏好影响最优模型选择。

Conclusion: LOTUS为详细图像描述评估提供了全面框架，强调用户偏好的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

Method: 提出MMBench-GUI基准和EQA指标，涵盖GUI内容理解、元素定位、任务自动化和协作四个层级。

Result: 视觉定位对任务成功至关重要，模块化框架和任务规划能力显著提升性能，但任务效率普遍不足。

Conclusion: 高效GUI自动化需结合精准定位、有效规划和停止策略，基准代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

TL;DR: AEDR是一种无需训练的图像溯源方法，通过双重重建和损失比提高准确性，比现有方法快100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，追踪生成图像的来源成为重要安全需求，现有方法在准确性和计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 提出AEDR方法，利用连续自编码器进行双重重建，通过损失比和图像同质性校准信号。

Result: 在八种顶级潜在扩散模型上，AEDR比现有方法准确率提高25.5%，计算时间仅需1%。

Conclusion: AEDR为生成模型提供了一种高效、准确的溯源解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了方法的优越性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在噪声和不完整点云分析中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

TL;DR: GPSMamba框架通过结合语义-频率提示和热谱注意力，解决了红外图像超分辨率中因果建模的局限性，实现了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像的低对比度和稀疏纹理需要长程建模，但现有1D因果扫描机制会破坏2D图像的全局上下文。

Method: 提出GPSMamba框架，包括自适应语义-频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失。

Result: 实验表明GPSMamba在红外图像恢复中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSMamba为红外图像恢复提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明，新方法评分准确性提升超10%，并能优化文本到图像生成模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为图像生成技术向高阶人类审美偏好发展提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

Conclusion: MuStD网络通过多流结构有效融合多模态数据，显著提升了户外3D物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

Motivation: 预测大脑对自然多模态刺激的反应是计算神经科学的关键挑战，但现有编码模型在全新上下文中的泛化能力尚未充分验证。

Method: 使用X-CLIP（视觉）和Whisper（听觉）特征提取器构建编码模型，并在ID和OOD数据上进行严格评估。

Result: 高容量注意力模型在ID数据上表现优异，但线性模型在OOD数据上更稳健，性能提升18%。语言特征未提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: 严格的OOD测试对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型架构、刺激特征和感官层级共同影响多模态世界的神经编码。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Result: 实验表明，ScenePainter克服了语义漂移，生成了更一致且沉浸的3D视图序列。

Conclusion: ScenePainter通过场景概念图有效解决了语义漂移问题，提升了3D场景生成的质量。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了长尾类的识别准确性，为CXR分类提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的检测器在小物体检测中仍面临特征金字塔网络（FPN）的噪声敏感性和标签分配策略中查询质量下降的问题。

Method: NRQO通过NT-FPN在特征融合中保持空间和语义信息完整性以减少噪声，并通过PS-RPN利用位置和形状相似性生成高质量正查询。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NRQO表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: NRQO通过创新的噪声容忍和查询优化策略，显著提升了小物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Haochen Han,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Fangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中较少涉及的否定理解问题，提出了一种低资源消耗的测试时适应方法NEAT，以解决否定分布与肯定分布之间的概念偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用需要模型明确识别虚假或不存在的内容，但现有VLMs在否定理解上表现不佳，且传统数据驱动方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NEAT方法，通过测试时调整分布相关参数，减少语义一致性的分布偏移并消除无关语义的虚假一致性。

Result: 在多种否定理解任务上的实验验证了NEAT的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT为VLMs的否定理解提供了一种高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Result: 在基准数据集上定性和定量评估均优于现有方法，且对新被试适应性强。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了跨被试解码的误差累积问题，显著提升了重建质量和适应性。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Conclusion: SP-Mamba通过结合Mamba模型的优势，显著提升了医学异常检测的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）在密集预测中表现良好，但如何平衡共享表示与任务特定专业化仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 提出任务内专家，沿MLP的中间隐藏维度划分任务信息；2. 引入共享专家，整合任务内不同上下文的共同信息；3. 设计全局专家，根据输入特征和任务需求促进跨任务知识转移。同时采用微调方法仅训练解码器参数以提高效率。

Conclusion: FGMoE通过细粒度专家设计和微调方法，有效提升了多任务学习的性能和参数效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但容易产生对象幻觉，即描述图像中不存在的对象。

Method: LISA利用模型的功能层次结构，通过区域特定频谱调制和基于锚的路由融合多层token级logits。

Result: 实验表明，LISA在CHAIR_I基准上减少幻觉达53.6%，POPE F1提升4.5%。

Conclusion: LISA是一种即插即用的方法，能有效减少对象幻觉，提升生成一致性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨空间时间融合（CSTF）机制，通过整合多模态图像中的尺度不变关键点，改进跨模态遥感图像匹配的特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态图像之间存在显著的几何和辐射差异，现有方法在提取特征时往往无法有效捕捉跨模态相似性。

Method: CSTF机制通过创建对应图和多区域信息整合，将相似性匹配重新定义为分类任务，结合SoftMax和全卷积网络（FCN）层。

Result: 在HRSC2016和DOTA数据集上，CSTF分别达到90.99%和90.86%的平均mAP，推理速度为12.5 FPS。

Conclusion: CSTF通过改进跨模态特征匹配，显著提升了遥感应用（如目标检测）的性能。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

Motivation: 现有方法在点云恢复中难以有效结合拓扑和几何属性，导致恢复效果不佳。

Method: 1. 使用连续映射提取拓扑嵌入；2. 提出InterTwining Attention机制融合拓扑和几何嵌入；3. 引入几何损失和拓扑约束损失优化嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有采样和恢复方法。

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer通过结合拓扑和几何特征，显著提升了点云恢复的性能。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用激活稀疏性，优化量化配置，以在模型性能和效率之间取得更好的平衡。

Method: 提出Two-Branch Swin Block，分别处理高精度和低精度激活，兼容QAT和PTQ方法。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，MixA-Q在PTQ配置下实现1.35倍计算加速且无精度损失；QAT配置下实现1.25倍加速（无损失）或1.53倍加速（仅1% mAP下降）。

Conclusion: MixA-Q通过稀疏感知量化适应，显著减少量化误差，提升量化模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Motivation: 现有少样本分割方法中，原型学习预测保守，亲和力学习预测激进，需平衡两者以提高分割效果。

Method: 提出PAHNet，包含原型引导特征增强（PFE）模块和注意力分数校准（ASC）模块，利用预训练原型预测器优化亲和力学习模型。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上，PAHNet在1-shot和5-shot设置中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet通过平衡保守与激进信息，显著提升了少样本分割的准确性。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

TL;DR: DASH提出了一种实时动态场景渲染框架，结合4D哈希编码与自监督分解，解决了现有方法中的特征重叠和渲染质量差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景重建是3D视觉中的长期挑战，现有方法因低秩假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量差，而4D哈希编码直接应用于整个场景则会导致哈希冲突和冗余。

Method: DASH采用自监督分解机制分离动态和静态组件，引入多分辨率4D哈希编码器表示动态元素，并提出时空平滑正则化策略以减少不稳定变形伪影。

Result: 实验表明，DASH在真实数据集上实现了最先进的动态渲染性能，视觉质量提升，单4090 GPU上达到264 FPS的实时速度。

Conclusion: DASH通过结合4D哈希编码与自监督分解，显著提升了动态场景渲染的质量和效率。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Motivation: 多头自注意力在视觉Transformer中计算复杂度高，补丁剪枝是提高效率的有效方法。

Method: 通过评估多头自注意力权重的方差（或中位数绝对偏差）确定补丁重要性，并结合重叠补丁嵌入提升性能。

Result: 在保持分类准确性的同时提高了吞吐量，重叠补丁嵌入进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在训练和推理中均适用，为高效视觉Transformer提供了一种可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架在多种天气条件下表现优异，减少了训练数据的依赖，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有方法中存在特征纠缠和几何不一致的问题，VisHall3D旨在通过两阶段分解任务来解决这些问题。

Method: VisHall3D分为两阶段：1) VisFrontierNet重建可见区域；2) OcclusionMAE推断不可见区域。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中，VisHall3D表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisHall3D通过两阶段设计有效提升了场景补全的准确性和可靠性，为自动驾驶等应用提供了更好的场景理解。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Motivation: 现有视觉注意力模型和数据集忽视主观认知多样性对注视行为的影响，且传统显著性预测模型因低分辨率图像和格式限制难以捕捉个性化模式。

Method: 提出SPA-ADV数据集（486视频，4500+参与者）和PRE-MAP模型，结合多属性用户配置和强化学习优化眼动追踪，引入C-GRPO确保预测点格式和空间准确性。

Result: 在SPA-ADV和其他基准测试中验证了PRE-MAP的有效性，显著提升了个性化注意力预测的准确性。

Conclusion: SPA-ADV和PRE-MAP为个性化视觉注意力研究提供了新工具，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）生成多人类动态场景的上下文运动，通过事件序列和空间指导实现高扩展性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多人类动态场景中上下文运动的复杂性问题，实现超越现有规模的多样化行为生成。

Method: 1. 事件生成器将动态场景分解为事件序列；2. 基于空间指导采样角色位置并合成运动；3. 高层模块提供上下文描述以检索精确坐标。

Result: 基准测试和用户研究表明，该框架能有效捕捉场景上下文，具有高扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次在大规模和多样性上解决了多人类动态场景生成问题，并提供了评估基准。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

Motivation: 解决单车辆自动驾驶系统的局限性，探索多智能体协作感知，特别是未充分研究的协作序列感知任务（如3D多目标跟踪）。

Method: 提出CoopTrack框架，包括多维度特征提取和跨智能体关联与聚合，通过特征图实现自适应关联与融合。

Conclusion: CoopTrack为协作跟踪任务提供了高效解决方案，展示了实例级特征传输和自适应关联的优势。

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态异常检测框架，解决2D和3D信息融合不足及异常样本稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中，仅用2D信息检测3D深度异常不足，且多模态信息差异大，异常样本稀缺。

Method: 从3D点云提取深度信息，用2D RGB图像表示外观，支持统一异常生成；提出多尺度高斯异常生成器和统一纹理异常生成器。

Result: 在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 框架有效桥接2D和3D异常检测，无需复杂融合即可利用多模态特征。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成长且事实性强的描述时表现不佳，传统评估方法不适用于长描述或无人工标注的场景。

Method: 提出OV-Fact方法，利用开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，无需人工标注，同时评估描述的丰富性和事实精确性。

Result: OV-Fact在减少噪声数据（2.5-5倍）的情况下，显著提升下游任务的事实精确性，同时保持描述的丰富性。

Conclusion: OV-Fact为长描述的事实性评估提供了高效且无需人工标注的解决方案，适用于数据过滤和模型优化。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

TL;DR: SimMLM是一个简单但强大的多模态学习框架，适用于模态缺失场景，通过动态专家混合架构和MoFe排名损失提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂架构或数据填补技术，SimMLM旨在提供通用且高效的解决方案，适应不同模态缺失情况。

Method: 采用动态模态专家混合（DMoME）架构和MoFe排名损失，动态调整模态贡献并确保任务准确性。

Result: 在医学图像分割和多模态分类任务中表现优于现有方法，准确性和鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: SimMLM在完整和缺失模态场景下均表现出色，具有广泛适用性和高可靠性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner为遥感推理提供了灵活且自主的解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Conclusion: PINO为动画、游戏和机器人应用提供了一种高效且可控的多人互动生成方法。

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Result: 在BCCD数据集上，ABCD方法达到95.49% mAP@0.5和86.89% mAP@0.5-0.9，分别比基线算法提高2.8%和23.41%，检测速度提升2.9%。

Conclusion: ABCD方法高效且适用于实时应用，显著提升了血细胞检测的准确性和速度。

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB数据。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展V2X感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了EA-ViT的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: EA-ViT提供了一种高效且灵活的ViT适应方案，显著降低了部署成本。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Conclusion: BEV-LLM在场景描述任务中表现优异，新数据集填补了现有基准的空白。

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on

Conclusion: MAELRE为长范围编码提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种模态。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多任务的深度证据融合网络（DEFNet），通过结合场景和失真类型分类任务，改进了盲图像质量评估（BIQA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BIQA方法因集成不足和缺乏灵活的不确定性估计而性能受限。

Method: 设计了多任务优化的DEFNet，采用可信信息融合策略和基于证据学习的不确定性估计技术。

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上验证了框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DEFNet表现出强大的泛化能力和对未知场景的适应性。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型的语言和图像理解机制已被广泛研究，但其时空理解的内部推理机制仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出一个系统性的电路框架，包括视觉审计电路、语义追踪电路和注意力流电路，用于分析LVLMs中的时空语义处理。

Result: 发现视觉语义集中在特定对象标记上，移除这些标记会导致模型性能下降高达92.6%；同时，模型中层至深层对时空语义表现出功能定位。

Conclusion: 研究为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了重要机制性见解，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖LiDAR标注，限制了可扩展性，无法利用大量众包数据进行自动标注。

Method: 采用Octree-based Gaussian Surfel优化显式占用表示，将场景分解为静态背景、地面和动态物体，分别建模。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上实现了最先进的几何重建效果，并在Occ3D-Waymo和Occ3D-nuScenes上展示了优越的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了基于视觉的大规模占用空间重建作为自动驾驶感知新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Motivation: 传统方法如NeRF和3DGS需要精确姿态且计算成本高，限制了其在空间应用中的使用。

Method: 使用CNN从单目图像生成粗略3D模型和姿态估计，用于初始化3DGS，减少训练迭代和输入图像需求。

Result: 即使姿态估计不精确，仍能学习高保真3D模型，训练成本和输入需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间应用中的新视角合成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

Result: 实验结果显示ApproxJoin性能提升2-19倍，同时保持高准确率（99%召回率）。

Conclusion: ApproxJoin通过近似匹配算法有效提升了模糊集合相似性连接问题的处理效率，且准确性高。

Abstract: The set similarity join problem is a fundamental problem in data processing
and discovery, relying on exact similarity measures between sets. In the
presence of alterations, such as misspellings on string data, the fuzzy set
similarity join problem instead approximately matches pairs of elements based
on the maximum weighted matching of the bipartite graph representation of sets.
State-of-the-art methods within this domain improve performance through
efficient filtering methods within the filter-verify framework, primarily to
offset high verification costs induced by the usage of the Hungarian algorithm
- an optimal matching method. Instead, we directly target the verification
process to assess the efficacy of more efficient matching methods within
candidate pair pruning.
  We present ApproxJoin, the first work of its kind in applying approximate
maximum weight matching algorithms for computationally expensive fuzzy set
similarity join verification. We comprehensively test the performance of three
approximate matching methods: the Greedy, Locally Dominant and Paz Schwartzman
methods, and compare with the state-of-the-art approach using exact matching.
Our experimental results show that ApproxJoin yields performance improvements
of 2-19x the state-of-the-art with high accuracy (99% recall).

Abstract: This paper presents a formalism for defining properties of paths in graph

navigational queries. In particular, our formalism allows us to define
quantitative properties such as length or accumulated cost, which can be used
as query filters. Furthermore, it enables the identification and removal of
paths that may be considered ill-formed.
  The new formalism is defined in terms of an operational semantics for the
query language that incorporates these new constructs, demonstrating its
soundness and completeness by proving its compatibility with a simple logical
semantics. We also analyze its expressive power, showing that path properties
are more expressive than register automata. Finally, after discussing some
complexity issues related to this new approach, we present an empirical
analysis carried out using our prototype implementation of the graph database
that serves as a running example throughout the paper. The results show that
queries using path properties as filters outperform standard queries that do
not use them.

Abstract: GPUs have become indispensable in high-performance computing, machine
learning, and many other domains. Efficiently utilizing the memory subsystem on
GPUs is critical for maximizing computing power through massive parallelism.
Analyzing memory access patterns has proven to be an effective method for
understanding memory bottlenecks in applications. However, comprehensive
runtime and fine-grained memory profiling support is lacking on GPU
architectures. In this work, we introduce cuThermo, a lightweight and practical
profiling tool for GPU memory analysis. It operates on GPU binaries without
requiring any modifications to hardware, operating system, or application
source code. Given a CUDA application, cuThermo identifies memory
inefficiencies at runtime via a heat map based on distinct visited warp counts
to represent word-sector-level data sharing and provides optimization guidance
in performance tuning iterations. Through our experiments on six applications,
we identified five memory access patterns that are portable across different
GPU architectures. By evaluating optimization on two GPUs, cuThermo achieves up
to $721.79\%$ performance improvement.

Abstract: With the rapid innovation of GPUs, heterogeneous GPU clusters in both public
clouds and on-premise data centers have become increasingly commonplace. In
this paper, we demonstrate how pipeline parallelism, a technique wellstudied
for throughput-oriented deep learning model training, can be used effectively
for serving latency-bound model inference, e.g., in video analytics systems, on
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Our work exploits the synergy between diversity in
model layers and diversity in GPU architectures, which results in comparable
inference latency for many layers when running on low-class and high-class
GPUs. We explore how such overlooked capability of low-class GPUs can be
exploited using pipeline parallelism and present a novel inference serving
system, PPipe, that employs pool-based pipeline parallelism via an MILP-based
control plane and a data plane that performs resource reservation-based
adaptive batching. Evaluation results on diverse workloads (18 CNN models) show
that PPipe achieves 41.1% - 65.5% higher utilization of low-class GPUs while
maintaining high utilization of high-class GPUs, leading to 32.2% - 75.1%
higher serving throughput compared to various baselines.

Abstract: The demand for stringent interactive quality-of-service has intensified in

existing research has mainly focused on reducing the number of late jobs whose
deadlines are not met. However, the primary challenge with these methods lies
in the total search time and scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present
the optimal job scheduling algorithm designed to determine the optimal task
order for a given set of tasks. In addition, users are enabled to make informed
decisions for offloading tasks based on the information provided by servers.
The details of performance analysis are provided to show its optimality and low
complexity with the linearithmic time O(nlogn), where $n$ is the number of
tasks. To tackle the uncertainty of the randomly arriving tasks, we further
develop an online approach with fast outage detection that achieves rapid
acceptance times with time complexity of O(n). Extensive numerical results are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of
the service ratio and scheduling cost.

*Yufang Li,Yuanbo Zhang,Hanlong Liao,Guoming Tang,Deke Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPUnion是一个校园GPU资源共享平台，通过自愿参与和保留提供者自主权，提高GPU利用率并支持弹性任务执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决校园内GPU资源分配不均的问题，同时尊重学术资源的自愿性和自主性。

Method: 采用容器化任务调度、资源提供者优先架构和弹性执行机制（如自动检查点和迁移）。

Result: 案例研究表明，GPU利用率提高30%，交互会话增加40%，任务迁移成功率94%。

Conclusion: GPUnion证明了提供者自主性与平台可靠性可以共存，挑战了传统的集中式资源分配模式。

Abstract: A pronounced imbalance in GPU resources exists on campus, where some
laboratories own underutilized servers while others lack the compute needed for
AI research. GPU sharing can alleviate this disparity, while existing platforms
typically rely on centralized oversight and persistent allocation models,
conflicting with the voluntary and autonomous nature of academic resource
ownership. We present GPUnion, a campus-scale GPU sharing platform enabling
voluntary participation while preserving full provider autonomy. GPUnion
incorporates three core mechanisms: i) container-based task dispatching and
execution, ii) resource provider-first architecture, and iii) resilient
execution featuring automatic checkpointing and migration. GPUnion also
supports custom data storage and integrates the non-root execution and image
attestation for isolation and security improvement for containerization. Case
studies across multiple campus scenarios demonstrate 30% more GPU utilization
improvement, 40% increase in interactive sessions, and 94% successful workload
migration during provider departures. GPUnion demonstrates that provider
autonomy and platform reliability can coexist, challenging conventional
centralized paradigms and democratizing access to computational resources
within campus networks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了ICT环境影响的增长，提出通过改进租户间资源共享来减少物理资源使用，尽管可能牺牲性能，但能提高能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICT的环境影响日益显著，资源有限性要求更严格的管理，而当前租户间资源共享不足，需探索新方法。

Method: 提出超越传统硬件级时间共享的高抽象资源共享方法，强调在性能降低条件下减少资源使用。

Result: 研究表明改进资源共享可减少集群规模、提高能效，性能与资源使用的权衡可能更易被社会接受。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁重新审视资源共享方法，提出未来研究方向，以实现更可持续的ICT基础设施。

Abstract: The environmental impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
continues to grow, driven notably by increasing usage, rebound effects, and
emerging demands. However, despite the virtual nature of its services, the
sector remains inherently constrained by its materiality and cannot rely on an
infinite pool of resources. As a result, the wide variety of supported services
may need to be managed under stricter limits within hosting facilities in the
future. Contrary to common assumptions, we show that tenants typically do not
share computing resources, even in environments commonly perceived as
mutualized, such as cloud platforms. Time-sharing has been progressively phased
out for reasons of performance, security, predictability, and, perhaps more
importantly, due to the decreasing cost of computing resources. This paper
advocates for managing fewer physical resources by improving resource sharing
between tenants. It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional
time-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach
entails "doing with fewer resources" under conditions of "reduced performance".
Nonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster
sizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related
to the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially
acceptable than eliminating services. We review the current state of the art,
identify challenges and opportunities, propose interpretations of Time-Shared
Computing, and outline key research directions.

TL;DR: 本文通过全球分布的CDN数据分析了移动设备的网络体验，重点关注延迟、吞吐量和稳定性。研究发现，移动用户偶尔能体验到极低延迟（低至6毫秒），但仅5%的用户能稳定低于20毫秒。吞吐量方面，60%用户低于50 Mb/s。最小延迟在特定地点通常稳定，可用于异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G时代的到来，移动设备对高性能网络的需求日益增长，本文旨在通过CDN数据提供中立、全球化的视角，分析移动网络的实际表现。

Method: 利用商业、全球分布的CDN数据，对移动客户端的延迟、吞吐量和稳定性进行测量和分析。

Result: 移动用户偶尔能体验到极低延迟（6毫秒），但仅5%用户稳定低于20毫秒；60%用户吞吐量低于50 Mb/s；最小延迟在特定地点通常稳定。

Conclusion: 移动网络体验存在显著差异，最小延迟的稳定性可用于异常检测，为网络优化提供参考。

Abstract: The web experience using mobile devices is important since a significant
portion of the Internet traffic is initiated from mobile devices. In the era of
5G, users expect a high-performance data network to stream media content and
for other latency-sensitive applications. In this paper, we characterize mobile
experience in terms of latency, throughput, and stability measured from a
commercial, globally-distributed CDN. Unlike prior work, CDN data provides a
relatively neutral, carrier-agnostic perspective, providing a clear view of
multiple and international providers. Our analysis of mobile client traffic
shows mobile users sometimes experience markedly low latency, even as low as 6
ms. However, only the top 5% users regularly experience less than 20 ms of
minimum latency. While 100 Mb/s throughput is not rare, we show around 60%
users observe less than 50 Mb/s throughput. We find the minimum mobile latency
is generally stable at a specific location which can be an important
characteristic for anomaly detection.

Conclusion: LLM方法在任务卸载和资源分配中具有潜力，可作为传统方法的替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general digital twin edge computing network
comprising multiple vehicles and a server. Each vehicle generates multiple
computing tasks within a time slot, leading to queuing challenges when
offloading tasks to the server. The study investigates task offloading
strategies, queue stability, and resource allocation. Lyapunov optimization is
employed to transform long-term constraints into tractable short-term
decisions. To solve the resulting problem, an in-context learning approach
based on large language model (LLM) is adopted, replacing the conventional
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LLM-based method achieves comparable or even superior
performance to MARL.

Method: iPLAN将多模态室内环境信息嵌入LLM优化器，支持现有环境规划和新建筑联合设计，采用多代理策略分步完成任务。

Result: 仿真显示iPLAN在IWN规划中表现优异，并通过联合设计优化建筑无线性能。

Conclusion: iPLAN为IWN规划提供了新范式，展示了LLM在复杂网络规划中的潜力。

Abstract: Efficient indoor wireless network (IWN) planning is crucial for providing
high-quality 5G in-building services. However, traditional meta-heuristic and
artificial intelligence-based planning methods face significant challenges due
to the intricate interplay between indoor environments (IEs) and IWN demands.
In this article, we present an indoor wireless network Planning with large
LANguage models (iPLAN) framework, which integrates multi-modal IE
representations into large language model (LLM)-powered optimizers to improve
IWN planning. First, we instate the role of LLMs as optimizers, outlining
embedding techniques for IEs, and introducing two core applications of iPLAN:
(i) IWN planning based on pre-existing IEs and (ii) joint design of IWN and IE
for new wireless-friendly buildings. For the former, we embed essential
information into LLM optimizers by leveraging indoor descriptions,
domain-specific knowledge, and performance-driven perception. For the latter,
we conceptualize a multi-agent strategy, where intelligent agents
collaboratively address key planning sub-tasks in a step-by-step manner while
ensuring optimal trade-offs between the agents. The simulation results
demonstrate that iPLAN achieves superior performance in IWN planning tasks and
optimizes building wireless performance through the joint design of IEs and
IWNs, exemplifying a paradigm shift in IWN planning.

Motivation: 解决多用户无线VR通信中的低秩信道问题，提升数据速率和能效。

Conclusion: 该方法在多用户VR通信中显著优于现有技术，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Wireless support of virtual reality (VR) has challenges when a network has
multiple users, particularly for 3D VR gaming, digital AI avatars, and remote
team collaboration. This work addresses these challenges through investigation
of the low-rank channels that inevitably occur when there are more active users
than there are degrees of spatial freedom, effectively often the number of
antennas. The presented approach uses optimal nonlinear transceivers,
equivalently generalized decision-feedback or successive cancellation for
uplink and superposition or dirty-paper precoders for downlink. Additionally, a
powerful optimization approach for the users' energy allocation and decoding
order appears to provide large improvements over existing methods, effectively
nearing theoretical optima. As the latter optimization methods pose real-time
challenges, approximations using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are used to
approximate best performance with much lower (5x at least) complexity.
Experimental results show significantly larger sum rates and very large power
savings to attain the data rates found necessary to support VR. Experimental
results show the proposed algorithm outperforms current industry standards like
orthogonal multiple access (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as
well as the highly researched methods in multi-carrier NOMA (MC-NOMA),
enhancing sum data rate by 39%, 28%, and 16%, respectively, at a given power
level. For the same data rate, it achieves power savings of 75%, 45%, and 40%,
making it ideal for VR applications. Additionally, a near-optimal deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based resource allocation framework for real-time
use by being 5x faster and reaching 83% of the global optimum is introduced.

Recently, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods have been showing
promising potential to address this complexity. However, the lack of a

effectiveness, such as scalability, generalization, and scalability.
Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analysis through extensive experiments to
provide valuable insights into performance trade-offs for efficient
implementation and offer actionable guidance for future research directions.
Overall, with its diverse simulations, rich implementations, and extensive
evaluation capabilities, Virne could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for
advancing NFV-RA methods and deep RL applications. The code is publicly

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，用于优化IEEE 802.11bn中的多接入点协调（MAPC）调度，以减少网络中最坏情况下的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集Wi-Fi部署中，多接入点协调（MAPC）能够通过联合调度决策提升吞吐量、延迟和可靠性，但在重叠基本服务集（OBSS）中实现高效调度仍具挑战性。

Method: 将MAPC调度建模为序列决策问题，并采用近端策略优化（PPO）训练DRL代理，利用空间复用（SR）组同时调度多个AP-站点对。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在多种网络负载和流量模式下优于现有启发式策略，99%分位延迟降低高达30%。

Conclusion: 提出的DRL方法显著优化了MAPC调度性能，为未来Wi-Fi网络提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key feature of IEEE 802.11bn,
with a potential impact on future Wi-Fi networks. MAPC enables joint scheduling
decisions across multiple access points (APs) to improve throughput, latency,
and reliability in dense Wi-Fi deployments. However, implementing efficient
scheduling policies under diverse traffic and interference conditions in
overlapping basic service sets (OBSSs) remains a complex task. This paper
presents a method to minimize the network-wide worst-case latency by
formulating MAPC scheduling as a sequential decision-making problem and
proposing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) mechanism to minimize worst-case
delays in OBSS deployments. Specifically, we train a DRL agent using proximal
policy optimization (PPO) within an 802.11bn-compatible Gymnasium environment.
This environment provides observations of queue states, delay metrics, and
channel conditions, enabling the agent to schedule multiple AP-station pairs to
transmit simultaneously by leveraging spatial reuse (SR) groups. Simulations
demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic
strategies across a wide range of network loads and traffic patterns. The
trained machine learning (ML) models consistently achieve lower 99th-percentile
delays, showing up to a 30% improvement over the best baseline.

release builds. Through representative case studies, we analyze how specific
language constructs affect control flow, variable naming, and type information
recovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for tool developers and
highlight the need for Rust-aware decompilation strategies.

Abstract: Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) employs deep learning methods, particularly

This approach holds promise for reducing the dramatic labor costs or

potential of improving NTP by redesigning the proof language, given that LLMs'
capabilities depend highly on representations. We introduce \emph{MiniLang}, a
redesigned proof language for Isabelle/HOL incorporating an improved version of
Sledgehammer. Experiments show MiniLang benefits two fine-tuned LLMs by
improving the success rate on the PISA benchmark by up to 29\% in comparison to
generation of Isar proof script. The success rate under one attempt (so-called
\emph{pass@1}) reaches 69.1\%, exceeding the previous Baldur's pass@64

Method: 在ACL2s中定义Python类型子集，包括常用类型和用户自定义类型，并生成输入以模糊测试Python程序。

Result: 在四个开源仓库中测试，代码覆盖率为68%-80%，并发现了阻碍覆盖率的代码模式（如复杂分支条件和外部依赖）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，但未来需进一步优化以处理更复杂的Python类型和代码模式。

Abstract: Python is a high-level interpreted language that has become an industry
standard in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we take a first step
towards using ACL2s to reason about Python code by developing an embedding of a
subset of the Python type system in ACL2s. The subset of Python types we
support includes many of the most commonly used type annotations as well as
user-defined types comprised of supported types. We provide ACL2s definitions
of these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide
code coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s
embedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs
to fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that
are not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work
against four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and
generating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the
supported subset of Python types. Note that we only use the type signatures of
functions to generate inputs and treat the bodies of functions as black boxes.
We measure code coverage, which ranges from about 68% to more than 80%, and
identify code patterns that hinder coverage such as complex branch conditions
and external file system dependencies. We conclude with a discussion of the
results and recommendations for future work.

Conclusion: 该语言为多项式时间计算提供了理论和实践支持，简化了程序分析和验证。

Abstract: Runtime efficiency and termination are crucial properties in the studies of
program verification. Instead of dealing with these issues in an ad hoc manner,
it would be useful to develop a robust framework in which such properties are
guaranteed by design. This paper introduces a new imperative programming
language whose design is grounded in a static type system that ensures the
following equivalence property: All definable programs are guaranteed to run in
polynomial time; Conversely, all problems solvable in polynomial time can be
solved by some programs of the language. The contribution of this work is
twofold. On the theoretical side, the foundational equivalence property is
established, and the proof of the equivalence theorem is non-trivial. On the
practical side, a programming approach is proposed that can streamline program
analysis and verification for feasible computations. An interpreter for the
language has been implemented, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach in
practice.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的发展，大型组织可以利用其进行复杂的代码修复，因此开发了一个工程代理以高效解决测试失败问题。

Method: 以Llama为基础，使用ReAct框架开发代理，通过静态分析和测试失败反馈优化修复方案，并利用LLM-as-a-Judge确保修复符合标准。

Result: 离线测试中，70B模型表现接近405B模型；生产环境中，31.5%的修复被采纳。

Conclusion: 工程代理在代码修复中表现良好，但仍有改进空间，特别是在部分正确修复的反馈处理上。

Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become
viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an
Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale
across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an
agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test
failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason
and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We
provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it
can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch
conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,
the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we
found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger
but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness
(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis
tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the
solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of
42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were
reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated
fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes
from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick
approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the
Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good
starting point.

Motivation: 现有方法如微调或自我修复策略成本高或缺乏知识积累机制，MemoCoder旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MemoCoder采用多智能体协作框架，包括修复知识集和导师智能体，支持知识积累和检索。

Result: 在MBPP、HumanEval和LiveCodeBench基准测试中，MemoCoder表现优于零样本提示和自我修复策略。

Conclusion: MemoCoder在迭代优化和知识引导的代码生成中表现出色，具有显著改进。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub
Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to
support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct
solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with
challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to
diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or
self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to
accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework
that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past
fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores
successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor
Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and
refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that
guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public
benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem
complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms
both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging
from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating
its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

TL;DR: 对Jupyter Notebook中的错误和漏洞进行了大规模实证研究，发现配置问题和API使用错误是常见问题，并分析了相关安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jupyter Notebook因其独特功能（如配置脚本、Markdown等）难以用传统软件工程方法分析，需要专门研究其错误和漏洞。

Method: 收集并分析两大平台的大量Notebook数据，结合定量分析和定性研究（扎根理论）构建错误分类法，并评估部署框架的安全风险。

Result: 配置问题和API使用错误是Notebook中最常见的错误，同时部署框架存在安全风险。

Conclusion: Notebook的支持和维护不如传统软件，导致代码复杂、配置错误和维护不足。

Abstract: Background. Jupyter notebooks are one of the main tools used by data
scientists. Notebooks include features (configuration scripts, markdown,
images, etc.) that make them challenging to analyze compared to traditional
software. As a result, existing software engineering models, tools, and studies
do not capture the uniqueness of Notebook's behavior. Aims. This paper aims to
provide a large-scale empirical study of bugs and vulnerabilities in the
Notebook ecosystem. Method. We collected and analyzed a large dataset of
Notebooks from two major platforms. Our methodology involved quantitative
analyses of notebook characteristics (such as complexity metrics, contributor
activity, and documentation) to identify factors correlated with bugs.
Additionally, we conducted a qualitative study using grounded theory to
categorize notebook bugs, resulting in a comprehensive bug taxonomy. Finally,
we analyzed security-related commits and vulnerability reports to assess risks
associated with Notebook deployment frameworks. Results. Our findings highlight
that configuration issues are among the most common bugs in notebook documents,
followed by incorrect API usage. Finally, we explore common vulnerabilities
associated with popular deployment frameworks to better understand risks
associated with Notebook development. Conclusions. This work highlights that
notebooks are less well-supported than traditional software, resulting in more
complex code, misconfiguration, and poor maintenance.

TL;DR: 研究评估了单语言微调对开源语言模型在代码审查任务中的表现，发现其优于多语言基线，但人类审查员在复杂任务中仍更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码审查对软件质量至关重要，但耗时且认知负担重，语言模型为自动化审查任务提供了新途径。

Method: 对CodeReviewer、CodeLlama-7B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill三种模型进行单语言微调，结合公共基准和工业数据集，评估其在代码变更质量估计、审查评论生成和代码改进任务中的表现。

Result: 单语言微调提高了模型的准确性和相关性，语言模型在常规任务中表现良好，但人类审查员在复杂任务中更优。

Conclusion: 语言对齐和任务特定适配对优化语言模型在自动化代码审查中至关重要。

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often
time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial
environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new
avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical
evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs
across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation,
Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct
models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific
dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study
investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural
languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment
generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an
automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their
practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual
fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual
baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially
for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling
semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the
importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs
for automated code review.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SliceMate是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的静态程序切片工具，通过三个专用代理（合成、验证和优化）实现高效切片，显著优于传统和基于学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切片工具依赖计算成本高的依赖图分析，难以扩展到大型程序或处理语法不完整的代码；而现有基于学习的方法在完整代码上表现不佳。

Method: SliceMate结合三个代理：合成代理生成候选切片，验证代理检查切片的完整性和简洁性，优化代理修复切片。控制模块协调代理确保高质量输出。

Result: 在包含2,200个Java和Python程序的SliceBench基准测试中，SliceMate显著优于传统和基于学习的工具。

Conclusion: SliceMate通过LLM代理实现了高效、准确的静态程序切片，解决了传统方法的扩展性和鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program
that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis
tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing
tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency
graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code
with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more
robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to
traditional methods on well-formed code.
  In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution
powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit
dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy.
Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis
agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope
across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a
verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the
candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a
refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with
the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module
that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual
intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality
benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python
programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly
larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing
tools.

Motivation: GitHub上大多数开源项目未对问题进行规范标签化，导致开发效率低下。自动分类可加速问题解决和任务分配。

Method: 分析了GitHub上知名开源项目的问题，并使用ML和DNN模型对常见标签（如API、Bug等）进行分类。

Result: DNN模型在分类任务中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 自动分类GitHub问题能显著提升开发效率，DNN模型是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: GitHub is the most widely used platform for software maintenance in the
open-source community. Developers report issues on GitHub from time to time
while facing difficulties. Having labels on those issues can help developers
easily address those issues with prior knowledge of labels. However, most of
the GitHub repositories do not maintain regular labeling for the issues. The
goal of this work is to classify issues in the open-source community using ML
\& DNN models. There are thousands of open-source repositories on GitHub. Some
of the repositories label their issues properly whereas some of them do not.
When issues are pre-labeled, the problem-solving process and the immediate
assignment of corresponding personnel are facilitated for the team, thereby
expediting the development process. In this work, we conducted an analysis of
prominent GitHub open-source repositories. We classified the issues in some
common labels which are: API, Documentation, Enhancement, Question, Easy,
Help-wanted, Dependency, CI, Waiting for OP's response, Test, Bug, etc. Our
study shows that DNN models outperf

TL;DR: SDVDiag是一个可扩展平台，用于自动化诊断联网车辆功能，通过动态依赖图和异常监测快速定位故障根源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联网车辆的高可靠性和可用性需求要求快速解决故障，但复杂的云/边缘架构依赖关系使手动分析不可行。

Method: SDVDiag平台支持从数据收集到根因追踪的自动化管道，动态更新依赖图并监测异常，通过图遍历生成最可能原因排名。

Result: 在5G测试车队环境中，SDVDiag能可靠检测注入的故障，减少停机时间。

Conclusion: SDVDiag通过自动化诊断和动态分析，为联网车辆提供早期问题识别和解决能力。

Abstract: Connected and software-defined vehicles promise to offer a broad range of
services and advanced functions to customers, aiming to increase passenger
comfort and support autonomous driving capabilities. Due to the high
reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial
to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex
cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to
diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible
since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.
  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible
platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The
platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial
data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag
supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.
Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting
in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are
monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of
the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis
is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely
causes.
  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment
for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be
detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new
insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an
early stage.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文创建了一个基准数据集（SESR-Eval）来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在系统综述标题-摘要筛选中的表现，发现LLMs表现相似且成本较低，但目前不建议自动化使用。

Motivation: 评估LLMs在软件工程系统综述标题-摘要筛选中的性能，并提供是否建议使用的证据。

Method: 从169个系统综述研究中选择24个构建数据集，用9种LLMs进行基准测试。

Result: SESR-Eval数据集包含34,528个标记研究，LLMs表现相似且成本低（<40美元/研究），但准确性差异大，未达到高召回率和合理精确度。

Conclusion: 目前不建议自动化使用LLMs进行筛选，未来将研究影响LLM表现的因素。

Abstract: Background: The use of large language models (LLMs) in the title-abstract
screening process of systematic reviews (SRs) has shown promising results, but
suffers from limited performance evaluation. Aims: Create a benchmark dataset
to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of
SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in
software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research
artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset.
Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results:
We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation)
dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary
studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed
similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies
are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is
relatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive
model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the
screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet
recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy
varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with
reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence
LLM screening performance between studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDV的软件版本和变体不断增加，缺乏统一的集成环境，需要动态编排功能以确保异构系统的可靠运行。

Method: 采用容器化开源工具构建标准化、可移植和可扩展的CI/CD流水线，并开发定制OTA中间件支持软件更新和回滚。

Result: 实验证明流水线支持无缝OTA更新、正确变体选择和跨目标编排，适用于自动驾驶功能的AI模型部署。

Conclusion: 该流水线为SDV管理软件变体和OTA更新提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，推动了未来移动技术的发展。

Abstract: Software-defined vehicles (SDVs) offer a wide range of connected
functionalities, including enhanced driving behavior and fleet management.
These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms,
resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the
diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The
lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as
connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable
operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions
that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper
presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the
build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized
open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem
accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware
distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend
services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies
and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development
and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness
is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving
TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are
developed and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results
demonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful
orchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a
scalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates
in SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需求规范过程中知识分散且耗时，希望通过LLMs自动化提升效率。

Method: 使用LLMs基于需求文档和模板生成Epic FDS和用户故事，并与人工生成结果对比。

Result: LLMs能自动化并标准化需求规范，但质量依赖输入且需人工修订。

Conclusion: 建议采用LLMs与人工协同的方式，LLMs作为起草工具，人工提供关键监督。

Abstract: In practice, requirements specification remains a critical challenge. The
knowledge necessary to generate a specification can often be fragmented across
diverse sources (e.g., meeting minutes, emails, and high-level product
descriptions), making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper,
we report our experience using large language models (LLMs) in an IT consulting
company to automate the requirements specification process. In this company,
requirements are specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a
document that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system,
application, or process. We provide LLMs with a summary of the requirements
elicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS
(including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, which are
subsequently compiled into a complete FDS document. We compared the correctness
and quality of the FDS generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs against those
produced by human analysts. Our results show that LLMs can help automate and
standardize the requirements specification, reducing time and human effort.
However, the quality of LLM-generated FDS highly depends on inputs and often
requires human revision. Thus, we advocate for a synergistic approach in which
an LLM serves as an effective drafting tool while human analysts provide the
critical contextual and technical oversight necessary for high-quality
requirements engineering (RE) documentation.

Result: 初步实验显示，该工具在经验丰富的开发者中取得了令人鼓舞的结果。

Conclusion: 自动化代码审查工具具有潜力，可有效支持开发者工作。

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released
software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires
experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth
review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive
burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their
primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this
paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards
automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of
a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our
preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code
review tool and the encouraging results.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Mut4All是一个基于LLM的自动化框架，用于生成语言无关的变异器，显著提高了编译器模糊测试的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计高质量的变异器对于现代复杂语言的编译器模糊测试具有挑战性，现有方法依赖人工设计，难以扩展和跨语言通用。

Method: Mut4All通过三个代理（变异器发明、实现合成和优化）自动化生成变异器，利用LLM和编译器知识。

Result: 处理1000个错误报告，生成722个变异器，发现62个Rust和34个C++编译器错误，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mut4All展示了自动化变异器生成的高效性和通用性，为编译器模糊测试提供了新方向。

Abstract: Mutation-based fuzzing is effective for uncovering compiler bugs, but
designing high-quality mutators for modern languages with complex constructs
(e.g., templates, macros) remains challenging. Existing methods rely heavily on
manual design or human-in-the-loop correction, limiting scalability and
cross-language generalizability.
  We present Mut4All, a fully automated, language-agnostic framework that
synthesizes mutators using Large Language Models (LLMs) and compiler-specific
knowledge from bug reports. It consists of three agents: (1) a mutator
invention agent that identifies mutation targets and generates mutator metadata
using compiler-related insights; (2) a mutator implementation synthesis agent,
fine-tuned to produce initial implementations; and (3) a mutator refinement
agent that verifies and corrects the mutators via unit-test feedback.
  Mut4All processes 1000 bug reports (500 Rust, 500 C++), yielding 319 Rust and
403 C++ mutators at ~$0.08 each via GPT-4o. Our customized fuzzer, using these
mutators, finds 62 bugs in Rust compilers (38 new, 7 fixed) and 34 bugs in C++
compilers (16 new, 1 fixed). Mut4All outperforms existing methods in both
unique crash detection and coverage, ranking first on Rust and second on C++.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReCatcher是一个用于Python代码生成的回归测试框架，通过比较两个LLM在逻辑正确性、代码质量和执行性能三个维度上的表现，评估模型更新（如微调、合并或新模型发布）可能引入的回归问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在代码生成领域的快速更新，模型更新可能引入回归问题（如正确性、代码质量和性能下降），因此需要系统化的回归测试框架来评估这些变化。

Method: ReCatcher通过系统化比较两个LLM（通常是当前模型和候选更新）在逻辑正确性、静态代码质量和执行性能三个维度上的表现，评估回归问题。

Result: 实验表明，微调、合并或新模型发布均可能引入回归问题，例如微调导致语法错误增加12%，合并导致正确性下降18%，GPT-4o在缺失导入问题上表现比GPT-3.5-turbo差50%。

Conclusion: ReCatcher在逻辑和性能方面表现优于基线方法，强调了在采用新模型前进行系统化回归评估的重要性，帮助研究者和从业者做出更明智的更新决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation evolve rapidly through
fine-tuning, merging, or new model releases. However, such updates can
introduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and
performance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing
framework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two
LLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three
dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution
performance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update
scenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama,
DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with
cross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with
general-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to
18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports
compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance
degradation in execution time versus GPT-4o. Overall, logical correctness,
performance, and error handling (e.g., syntax errors and missing imports) are
the most regression-prone areas. Comparing ReCatcher with baseline solutions,
it presents better and consistent accuracy across logical and performance
aspects. ReCatcher highlights the importance of systematic regression
evaluation before adopting new models, while assisting researchers and
practitioners in making more informed update decisions.

TL;DR: BUCOR是一种新的构建冲突解决工具，结合基于示例和基于规则的策略，有效解决合并冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合并冲突（包括文本冲突和构建测试冲突）影响软件质量和开发效率，现有工具对某些冲突（如方法移除）支持不足。

Method: BUCOR通过比较三个版本（base、left、right）检测冲突，并采用基于示例（BUCOR-E）和基于规则（BUCOR-R）的两种互补策略解决冲突。

Result: 在88个真实构建冲突中，BUCOR为65个案例生成至少一个解决方案，并正确解决43个冲突。

Conclusion: 结合上下文感知的示例学习和结构化规则解决冲突的混合方法有效，为未来更智能的合并工具提供方向。

Abstract: Merge conflicts often arise when developers integrate changes from different
software branches. The conflicts can result from overlapping edits in programs
(i.e., textual conflicts) or cause build and test errors (i.e., build and test
conflicts). They degrade software quality and hinder programmer productivity.
While several tools detect build conflicts, few offer meaningful support for
resolving cases like those caused by method removal. To overcome limitations of
existing tools, we introduce BUCOR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict
resolver. BUCOR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to
a merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it
employs two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BUCOR-E)
and rule-based transformation (BUCOR-R). BUCOR-R applies predefined rules to
handle common, well-understood conflicts. BUCOR-E mines branch versions (l and
r) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples,
it infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve more
complex conflicts.
  We evaluated BUCOR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct
conflict types. BUCOR generated at least one solution for 65 cases and
correctly resolved 43 conflicts. We observed that this hybrid
approach--combining context-aware, example-based learning with structured,
rule-based resolution--can effectively help resolve conflicts. Our research
sheds light on future directions for more intelligent and automated merge
tools.

Motivation: 网络在经济和组织应用中至关重要，但传统方法难以动态优化网络形成。

Method: 基于加权随机块模型（WSBM），将在线网络形成问题建模为非标准批处理多臂老虎机问题，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 理论证明了WSBM的批处理局部渐近正态性，并通过模拟验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法在动态环境中显著提升网络输出，并适应非平稳场景。

Abstract: Networks are central to many economic and organizational applications,
including workplace team formation, social platform recommendations, and
classroom friendship development. In these settings, networks are modeled as
graphs, with agents as nodes, agent pairs as edges, and edge weights capturing
pairwise production or interaction outcomes. This paper develops an adaptive,
or \textit{online}, policy that learns to form increasingly effective networks
as data accumulates over time, progressively improving total network output
measured by the sum of edge weights.
  Our approach builds on the weighted stochastic block model (WSBM), which
captures agents' unobservable heterogeneity through discrete latent types and
models their complementarities in a flexible, nonparametric manner. We frame
the online network formation problem as a non-standard \textit{batched
multi-armed bandit}, where each type pair corresponds to an arm, and pairwise
reward depends on type complementarity. This strikes a balance between
exploration -- learning latent types and complementarities -- and exploitation
-- forming high-weighted networks. We establish two key results: a
\textit{batched local asymptotic normality} result for the WSBM and an
asymptotic equivalence between maximum likelihood and variational estimates of
the intractable likelihood. Together, they provide a theoretical foundation for
treating variational estimates as normal signals, enabling principled Bayesian
updating across batches. The resulting posteriors are then incorporated into a
tailored maximum-weight matching problem to determine the policy for the next
batch. Simulations show that our algorithm substantially improves outcomes
within a few batches, yields increasingly accurate parameter estimates, and
remains effective even in nonstationary settings with evolving agent pools.

Conclusion: 新方法在估计技能形成模型时更具灵活性和准确性，为相关研究提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: This paper examines estimation of skill formation models, a critical
component in understanding human capital development and its effects on
individual outcomes. Existing estimators are either based on moment conditions
and only applicable in specific settings or rely on distributional
approximations that often do not align with the model. Our method employs an
iterative likelihood-based procedure, which flexibly estimates latent variable
distributions and recursively incorporates model restrictions across time
periods. This approach reduces computational complexity while accommodating
nonlinear production functions and measurement systems. Inference can be based
on a bootstrap procedure that does not require re-estimating the model for
bootstrap samples. Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application
demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing methods, whose estimators
can be substantially biased or noisy.

Conclusion: 新形式的固定效应模型为面板数据分析提供了更灵活的工具，对实证研究具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: The past 20 years have brought fundamental advances in modeling unobserved
heterogeneity in panel data. Interactive Fixed Effects (IFE) proved to be a
foundational framework, generalizing the standard one-way and two-way fixed
effects models by allowing the unit-specific unobserved heterogeneity to be
interacted with unobserved time-varying common factors, allowing for more
general forms of omitted variables. The IFE framework laid the theoretical
foundations for other forms of heterogeneity, such as grouped fixed effects
(GFE) and non-separable two-way fixed effects (NSTW). The existence of IFE, GFE
or NSTW has significant implications for identification, estimation, and
inference, leading to the development of many new estimators for panel data
models. This paper provides an accessible review of the new estimation methods
and their associated diagnostic tests, and offers a guide to empirical
practice. In two separate empirical investigations we demonstrate that there is
empirical support for the new forms of fixed effects and that the results can
differ significantly from those obtained using traditional fixed effects
estimators.

Conclusion: 预测模型在宏观审慎监管中具有潜力，结合深度学习技术可显著提升预测能力。

Abstract: We examine whether and how granular, real-time predictive models should be
integrated into central banks' macroprudential toolkit. First, we develop a
tractable framework that formalizes the tradeoff regulators face when choosing
between implementing models that forecast systemic risk accurately but have
uncertain causal content and models with the opposite profile. We derive the
regulator's optimal policy in a setting in which private portfolios react
endogenously to the regulator's model choice and policy rule. We show that even
purely predictive models can generate welfare gains for a regulator, and that
predictive precision and knowledge of causal impacts of policy interventions
are complementary. Second, we introduce a deep learning architecture tailored
to financial holdings data--a graph transformer--and we discuss why it is
optimally suited to this problem. The model learns vector embedding
representations for both assets and investors by explicitly modeling the
relational structure of holdings, and it attains state-of-the-art predictive
accuracy in out-of-sample forecasting tasks including trade prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估福利改革的成本与效益是政策制定者的关键目标，但儿童福利难以直接观察，因此需要新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用集体劳动供给模型，结合非参数部分识别方法，提出了一种能处理测量误差的估计策略。

Result: 研究发现儿童福利生产具有规模收益递减和家庭间异质性，弱势家庭（父母教育水平低、非房主）的儿童福利显著较低。

Conclusion: 研究强调了福利改革中改善儿童家庭环境政策的重要性。

Abstract: Children welfare is at the center of many welfare reforms such as cash
transfers to families and training programs to parents. A key goal for
policy-makers is to evaluate the costs and benefits of such reforms. The main
challenge lies in that the outcome of interest, children welfare, is
unobservable. To address this issue, I consider a collective labor supply model
with children where adult members have preferences over their own leisure,
expenditures, and children welfare. I show that the model nonparametrically
partially identifies the impacts of parental inputs on children welfare in
panel data. I then propose a novel estimation strategy that accommodates
measurement error and can be used to efficiently construct valid confidence
sets. Using Dutch data on couples with children, I investigate the structure of
the expected production technology and how it varies with household
characteristics. I find that the production of children welfare is
characterized by decreasing returns to scale and large heterogeneity across
household types. In particular, I find that children from disadvantaged
households, whose parents have low education levels and are not homeowners, are
significantly worse off. My results highlight the importance for welfare
reforms to include policies targeted at improving children home environment.

Method: 建立竞争市场模型，AI代理从上游生成模型购买答案并转售给用户，代理可进行验证努力以降低幻觉风险。

Result: 在非平凡折现下存在唯一声誉均衡，验证努力和价格随用户对准确性关注比例的增加而上升。

Conclusion: 对幻觉敏感的领域（如法律和医学）会内生地促使AI代理进行更严格的验证努力。

Abstract: We model a competitive market where AI agents buy answers from upstream
generative models and resell them to users who differ in how much they value
accuracy and in how much they fear hallucinations. Agents can privately exert
effort for costly verification to lower hallucination risks. Since interactions
halt in the event of a hallucination, the threat of losing future rents
disciplines effort. A unique reputational equilibrium exists under nontrivial
discounting. The equilibrium effort, and thus the price, increases with the
share of users who have high accuracy concerns, implying that
hallucination-sensitive sectors, such as law and medicine, endogenously lead to
more serious verification efforts in agentic AI markets.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for

Conclusion: 学习型单像素荧光显微镜有望推动诊断和生物学研究，以低成本实现多光谱成像。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了潜在扩散模型生成图像过于平滑的问题，提升了图像的真实性。

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Conclusion: 提出的改进后处理技术能有效管理分割错误，显著提高针重建精度。

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

Motivation: 医学图像中的噪声会影响诊断准确性，现有方法通常仅针对单一模态或噪声类型，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出DPL模型，通过双路径分别学习噪声特征和上下文信息，并融合生成最终去噪结果。

Result: DPL在多种模态和噪声类型中表现优异，PSNR比基线UNet提高3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL是一种通用且鲁棒的医学图像去噪方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

Conclusion: NerT-CA为稀疏视角下的4D冠状动脉重建提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

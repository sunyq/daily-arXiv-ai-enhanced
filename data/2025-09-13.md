### [1] [An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834)
*John T. Rickard,William A. Dembski,James Rickards*

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

*Amna Hassan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过精调的LLaMA-3模型和NLP技术，将游戏设计文档自动转换为Unity游戏原型，提高了代码生成的质量和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI辅助游戏开发中从设计到实现的转换问题，缩短游戏开发周期，提高生产力

Method: 使用精调的LLaMA-3模型专门用于Unity代码生成，结合自定义Unity集成包，实现从GDD解析到代码生成的端到端流程

Result: 在编译成功率、GDD遵循度、最佳实践和代码模块性等指标上超过现有最佳LLM，平均得分4.8/5.0，支持多种游戏类型

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI辅助游戏开发的关键问题，使LLM成为从游戏设计到实现迅速转换的有力工具

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

### [3] [Global Constraint LLM Agents for Text-to-Model Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08970)
*Junyang Cai,Serdar Kadioglu,Bistra Dilkina*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用多个专门化的LLM代理分解MiniZinc模型构建任务，每个代理负责特定类型的全局约束生成，最后组装成完整模型，表现超过传统提示方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述向MiniZinc模型的转换需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这一过程很具挑战性

Method: 采用多代理模式，每个LLM代理专门处理特定类型的全局约束检测和代码生成，最后由组装代理集成完整模型

Result: 初步实验显示该框架在多个LLM上都表现更好，超过了一次性提示和思维链提示等基准方法

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和专门化代理的方式可以有效降低MiniZinc模型构建的复杂度，为未来工作提供了完整的发展路线图

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

*Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi,Pedram Aghazadeh,Azalia Mirhosseini,Farinaz Koushanfar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种截断交叉熵(TCE)损失函数来缓解生成式AI模型在合成数据上重复训练导致的模型崩溃问题，通过降低对高置信度预测的权重来显著延迟模型崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着合成数据在训练中的占比不断增加，模型在合成数据上重复训练会导致模型崩溃现象，现有缓解策略有限。研究发现模型对其生成数据的过度自信是导致崩溃的关键因素。

Method: 提出置信度感知的损失函数Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE)，在训练过程中降低高置信度预测的权重，构建模型无关的框架将损失函数设计与模型崩溃缓解联系起来。

Result: TCE显著延迟了递归训练中的模型崩溃，将模型崩溃前的保真度间隔延长了2.3倍以上，且该方法在不同模态上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了简单而强大的工具，通过控制模型对自生成数据的过度自信来有效缓解模型崩溃问题。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

### [5] [Uncertainty Awareness and Trust in Explainable AI- On Trust Calibration using Local and Global Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08989)
*Carina Newen,Daniel Bodemer,Sonja Glantz,Emmanuel Müller,Magdalena Wischnewski,Lenka Schnaubert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究可解释AI中的不确定性解释和全局解释，通过测试算法在信任校准、用户满意度和可解释性方面的表现，探讨直观可视化理解的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然XAI的某些领域已有深入研究，但不确定性解释和全局解释往往被忽视。研究者希望构建XAI方案的通用指南，特别关注能够同时涵盖不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI等概念的算法。

Method: 选择了一个能够同时处理不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI概念的算法进行测试，评估其在信任校准方面的能力，并检验复杂但提供直观视觉理解的算法是否能带来更高的用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Result: 论文测试了算法的信任校准能力，并验证了提供直观视觉理解的算法（尽管可能更复杂）在用户满意度和可解释性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管某些XAI算法可能更复杂，但提供直观视觉理解的算法能够提高用户满意度和人类可解释性，这对于构建有效的XAI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

### [6] [Instructional Prompt Optimization for Few-Shot LLM-Based Recommendations on Cold-Start Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09066)
*Haowei Yang,Yushang Zhao,Sitao Min,Bo Su,Chao Yao,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文条件提示的方法来优化LLM在冷启动推荐任务中的表现，通过最优样本注入和指令结构化显著提升了few-shot设置下的推荐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中冷启动用户因缺乏历史行为信息而导致推荐效果下降的问题，探索如何通过提示工程优化LLM在低数据环境下的推荐性能。

Method: 提出上下文条件提示公式P(u, Ds)→R̂，其中u是冷启动用户画像，Ds是精选支持集，R̂是预测的项目排序列表。使用基于transformer的自回归LLM（BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4），采用token级对齐和嵌入空间正则化技术。

Result: 实验证明最优样本注入和指令结构化能显著提高precision@k和NDCG分数，提示组合不仅影响语法结构，还能直接控制注意力尺度和解码器推理行为。

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可有效解决LLM推荐管道中的冷启动问题，提示工程的及时组合具有功能性和语义保真度的重要作用。

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

### [7] [Understanding Economic Tradeoffs Between Human and AI Agents in Bargaining Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071)
*Crystal Qian,Kehang Zhu,John Horton,Benjamin S. Manning,Vivian Tsai,James Wexler,Nithum Thain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在动态多治理者协商任务中，贝叶斯模型通过突出的优化获得最高剩余，但抱死率高；LLM与人类总体性能相似，但LLM偏向保守折衰策略，而人类更具战略性、冒险性和公平性。表面性能平等形式下隐藏了流程和对齐性的根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着协调任务趋向自治组代理，需要评估代理在动态多治理者环境中的协商过程，而不仅仅是结果。不同代理各有优势：统计模型在条件明确时表现突出，LLM则具有上下文泛化能力。

Method: 在动态协商环境中对人类(N=216)、LLM(GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro)和贝叶斯代理进行直接对比，捕获结果和行为动态。

Result: 贝叶斯代理通过突出优化获得最高剩余，但抱死率高；人类和LLM能达到类似总体性能，但行为差异显著：LLM偏向保守折衰交易，抱死率低；人类更具战略性、冒险性和公平式行为。

Conclusion: 表面性能平等形式下很容易涉忽流程和对齐性的根本差异，而这些差异对于在真实世界协调任务中的实际部署至关重要。

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for

robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second
place in the competition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能系统在自主任务执行和语言推理方面取得进步，但空间推理能力仍有限且研究不足，需要突破符号化和序列处理的限制，以实现更好的物理世界交互。

Method: 研究从计算神经科学角度出发，提出了基于神经科学原理的计算框架，包含六个核心模块：生物受体反应多模态感知、多感官整合、自我中心-客观世界坐标转换、人工认知地图、空间记忆和空间推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了多智能体交互关系的动态演化特性，无法准确捕捉未来场景中不断变化的社会交互

Method: 采用动态异构图进行场景建模，设计渐进式多尺度解码策略，通过因子化架构处理时空依赖关系并逐步消除未来运动的不确定性

Result: 在INTERACTION多智能体预测基准中排名第一，在Argoverse 2多世界预测基准上也达到最先进性能

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过显式建模动态交互关系，有效提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: 通过构建高质量的真实数据分析数据集和推理框架，可以有效提升LLM在数据科学任务中的多步推理和工具使用能力，为自动化数据分析工作流提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Conclusion: 最小支持子锦标赛能够产生紧凑、可认证且直观的解释，为锦标赛获胜者提供形式化的解释框架

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了角色基础团队中隐式空间协谁的重要性，强调平衡的适应策略的价值，对培训和AI辅助团队支持系统具有重要意义

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Result: 构建了包含150个AutoML任务的基准测试，提供Lite(18任务)、Medium和Full三个版本，覆盖多种数据模态和难度级别。

Conclusion: TAM Bench提供了一个全面、可扩展的基准测试框架，能够更好地评估LLM代理在端到端机器学习工作流中的真实能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种将常识性语义推理嵌入自主代理器的实用可扩展方法，为完全智能自主探索提供了新方向

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Result: 实验结果表明TORSO在多样化的LLMs基准测试中实现了强劲性能，并生成了合理的推理过程

Conclusion: TORSO提供了一种有效的方法来激发LLMs的内在推理能力，无需依赖成本高昂的人工构建few-shot示例，在多个任务上表现优异

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

TL;DR: SEDM是一个自演进分布式记忆框架，通过可验证写入、动态记忆调度和跨域知识扩散来解决多智能体系统中记忆管理的噪声积累、内存膨胀和泛化限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期多智能体系统产生大量轨迹和交互历史，现有记忆管理方法存在噪声积累、内存膨胀和跨域泛化能力有限的问题，需要更高效可验证的记忆框架。

Method: SEDM框架包含三个核心组件：基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度记忆控制器、以及抽象可重用见解支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，SEDM相比强记忆基线提高了推理准确性并降低了token开销，还能将从事实验证中提炼的知识用于增强多跳推理。

Conclusion: SEDM为开放式多智能体协作提供了一个可扩展且可持续的记忆机制，将记忆从被动存储转变为主动自优化的组件。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

Motivation: 人类认知具有组合泛化的关键能力，但当前AI工具如视觉语言模型缺乏这种能力。先前基于组合张量的句子语义方法效果不佳，作者推测量子模型更高的训练效率将改善这类任务的性能。

Method: 将组合张量模型的表示解释在希尔伯特空间中，训练变分量子电路来学习这些表示。使用两种图像编码技术：二进制图像向量的多热编码(MHE)和基于CLIP视觉语言模型图像向量的角度/幅度编码。

Result: 使用噪声MHE编码获得了良好的概念验证结果。在CLIP图像向量上的表现较为复杂，但仍优于经典组合模型。

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中展现出潜力，特别是在特定的编码方式下能够超越经典方法，为量子机器学习在自然语言处理中的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

Conclusion: Auras有效克服了顺序计算的限制，为具身AI系统提供了高吞吐量的推理能力。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，大语言模型的单步准确率边际提升能带来任务完成长度的指数级改进，模型在长任务中的失败主要源于执行错误而非推理能力不足。通过提供明确的知识和计划，大模型能执行更多步骤，但存在自我条件效应——模型在包含先前错误的上下文中更容易犯错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型规模扩展是否带来边际收益递减，研究模型在长任务中的表现失败原因，以及如何通过提升执行能力来解决简单任务变长时的失败问题。

Method: 通过提供明确的知识和计划来隔离执行能力，比较不同规模模型在长任务中的表现，分析单步准确率随步骤增加的退化情况，研究自我条件效应，并对比前沿思维模型的表现。

Result: 发现大模型即使在小模型100%单步准确率的情况下也能正确执行更多步骤；模型单步准确率随步骤增加而下降，存在自我条件效应；思维模型不会自我条件化，能在单轮中执行更长的任务。

Conclusion: 通过关注执行能力，可以解释LLMs在解决复杂推理问题时的矛盾表现，并强调模型规模和顺序测试时计算对长视野任务的重要价值。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Result: 识别出了三个关键发现：额外信息能显著提高生成质量；LLM在过滤低质量三元组方面表现有效；响应解析方案需要在灵活性和一致性之间根据具体场景进行批量

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

Conclusion: 虽然自动化RAG系统能加速证据提取，但由于分析的复杂性，仍需采用人机协作方式，技术应增强而非替代专家判断以确保准确性

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

Motivation: 传统心理测量方法难以直接处理文本数据，需要一种能够将文本信息转换为可量化分析格式的新方法，以挖掘文本中的潜在知识维度和模式。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了文本数据的心理测量分析能力，在教育、心理学和法律等文本信息丰富的领域具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

Method: 开发BRoverbs数据集，使用巴西谚语作为评估工具，这些谚语包含文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构，能够有效测试模型对区域表达的理解。

Result: 创建了一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的评估基准数据集，可用于测试LLM在区域语言文化背景下的表现。

Conclusion: BRoverbs为葡萄牙语大语言模型提供了新的区域性评估工具，有助于推进基于区域背景的基准测试发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [30] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中表现不佳，主要瓶颈在于系数计数和变量识别，特别是在多步骤视觉推理中组合识别与推理时出现额外错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在需要集成感知和符号计算的任务中的局限性，特别是视觉方程求解任务，其中数学方程嵌入图像中，变量由对象图标表示，系数需要通过计数推断。

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务，分析VLMs在不同复杂度方程上的表现，并研究识别与推理组合时的错误模式。

Result: VLMs在文本方程上表现良好，但在视觉方程上失败；计数是主要瓶颈，即使识别准确；组合识别和推理会引入额外错误；随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身成为限制因素。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉基础数学推理方面存在关键弱点，这些发现为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [31] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一种通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能够有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供直接的关系信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个简单、低开销且可复现的工具来评估大型语言模型对用户互动的持续参与意愿，补充现有的模型审计指标。

Method: 使用3种用户语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）和10种互动刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的SPICE响应，共进行480次试验。

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动为60.4%。该信号与滥用分类不同，且在统计测试中保持稳健。

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销且可复现的模型倾向审计工具，通过提供直接的模型状态关系信号来补充现有指标。

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

Motivation: 探索不同的对齐技术（SFT、DPO和它们的组合）在提升语言模型安全性和有用性方面的效果，以构建更稳健的模型对齐流程

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集训练四个模型：基础OPT350M、SFT模型、DPO模型和SFT+DPO模型，并采用三个评估指标：无害率(HmR)、有用率(HpR)和综合对齐分数(CAS)

Result: SFT表现超过DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上都表现最好，证明了这些技术的互补性。研究也发现了噪声数据、GPU资源限制和训练约束等挑战

Conclusion: 研究提供了细化调优策略对模型对齐影响的全面视角，为未来建立更稳健的对齐流程奠定了基础

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中表现不足，特别是在处理复杂模式描述和需要多步推理的结构化输出场景时存在显著局限性。

Method: 结合强化学习和多视角推理，将大语言模型从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器，使其不仅能理解抽取内容，还能理解推理过程。

Result: 在多个信息抽取基准测试中，MR-UIE方法持续提升了跨领域的抽取准确率，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将多视角推理融入强化学习显著增强了复杂信息抽取任务中的泛化能力，凸显了推理在挑战性场景中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第5大语言在大语言模型中表现不足，特别是在代码生成领域，主要因难是缺乏高质量的训练数据

Method: 构建了综合的孜加拉语代码指令数据集，创建了MBPP-Bangla评测标准，开发了TigerCoder模型家族（包含1B和9B两个规模）

Result: 在Pass@1指标上比现有多语言和通用孜加拉语LLM提升了11-18%的性能，证明精心编辑的高质量数据可以克服小模型在低资源语言中的限制

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集和模型设计，可以有效提升低资源语言的代码生成能力，所有资源已开源以促进孜加拉语LLM研究的进一步发展

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3是一个针对东南亚电商领域的245B参数MoE模型，通过硬件优化和定制化训练策略，在电商任务上超越主流大模型，并在低资源语言上表现优异，已在Shopee平台大规模应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用领域表现优异，但在需要领域专业知识的专门任务（如电商）中性能下降，特别是东南亚电商数据具有噪声大、异构、多语言和高度动态的特点。

Method: 采用更少但更大的专家MoE架构（245B总参数，71B激活参数），结合硬件优化（节点内专家并行和定制memcpy操作符），在12T多语言语料和合成电商指令上混合训练，并提出OTPO方法增强对齐。

Result: 在电商任务上超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B，在东南亚低资源语言（印尼语、泰语、菲律宾语等）和葡萄牙语上表现强劲，同时在通用基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Compass-v3在电商专业知识和多语言能力方面具有双重优势，已在Shopee工业级电商平台广泛应用，替代了70%以上的OpenAI流量，证明了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

Method: 使用开源CIMA语料库，测试GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4模型，采用定制化提示进行导师对话行为的四分类任务。

Result: GPT-4模型表现最佳：准确率80%，加权F1分数0.81，Cohen's Kappa 0.74，与人工标注达到实质性一致。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在教育对话行为分类方面具有强大潜力，任务特定的标签定义和上下文信息对提升自动标注质量至关重要，同时需要关注伦理考量。

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations

Motivation: 解决越南语这一低资源语言缺乏竞争性重排序模型的问题，越南语具有复杂的语法和音调符号，需要专门的模型来处理。

Method: 基于BGE-M3编码器构建，采用Blockwise Parallel Transformer增强，使用8GB精选语料库训练，通过混合硬负采样进行微调以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在MMARCO-VI基准测试中实现了强大的早期排名准确性，超越了多语言基线模型，与PhoRanker竞争激烈。

Conclusion: ViRanker填补了越南语重排序模型的空白，展示了通过精心架构适配和数据整理可以推动其他低资源语言的重排序技术发展，模型已在Hugging Face开源发布。

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

Motivation: 降低神经编码模型实现的技术门槛，促进模型和数据集间的系统比较，增强方法严谨性，加速高质量脑活动预测模型的开发。

Method: 采用模块化流水线设计，涵盖脑数据集、脑区域、刺激特征（神经网络基础和对照组）、降采样方法等多样化方法选择，内置日志记录、绘图功能，并与实验跟踪平台无缝集成。

Result: 通过在三个故事聆听数据集（LeBel et al. (2023)、Narratives、Little Prince）上拟合多种编码模型，验证了框架的可扩展性和多功能性，并探索了构建连续fMRI数据编码模型的关键方法选择。

Conclusion: LITcoder有效降低了编码模型实施的技术障碍，促进了跨模型和数据集的系统比较，提高了方法严谨性，并加速了高性能脑活动预测模型的开发。

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖文本内容且忽视了数据集偏见，导致文本特征与输出标签间的假相关性，影响分类准确性。

Method: 提出反事实数据增强策略，最小化改变情感相关因果特征以生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本；设计适应性去偏对比学习机制来学习健壮特征并减少偏见词的影响。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法超越了现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: 该反事实增强去偏框架能够有效减少多模态情感分类中的偏见问题，提升模型的分类性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 当前基于文本大语言模型衍生的语音到语音大语言模型(SLLM)在知识和推理能力上存在退化，主要原因是训练范式未能弥合特征表示空间中的声学-语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出EchoX方法，利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习，使语音LLM保持强大的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，EchoX使用约6000小时训练数据，在多个基于知识的问答基准上实现了先进性能。

Conclusion: EchoX通过弥合声学-语义鸿沟，成功解决了SLLM的知识和推理能力退化问题，为语音大语言模型的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Trie偏置方法在beam search中需要撤销部分假设的奖励分数，计算开销大且仅限于beam search，限制了在大解码器模型中的应用

Method: 通过让ASR模型进行多步前瞻预测，直接估计部分假设是否能生成完整罕见词，避免分数撤销步骤。使用仅10小时合成数据对Whisper模型进行微调

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上，词错误率从30.86%降至12.19%，显著提升罕见词识别性能

Conclusion: 多步预测方法有效解决了传统上下文偏置的计算效率问题，在少量数据微调下即可实现显著的性能提升

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

Result: 在10小时合成数据上对Whisper进行适配后，在NSC Part 2测试集上将词误率从29.71%显著降至11.81%

Conclusion: 关键词感知损失函数能够有效提升上下文偏置模块的性能，通过补充性的偏置词预测和位置检测机制改善稀有词识别效果

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

Conclusion: GmSLM为神经科学、生物声学和进化生物学研究提供了有益工具，支持进一步研究发声交流的神经基础，并提供了连接发声与大脑活动的实用框架。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

*Wenhao Li,Bangcheng Sun,Weihao Ye,Tianyi Zhang,Daohai Yu,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCF是一种新颖的上下文压缩框架，通过分层潜在表示学习实现高效长上下文建模，在保持全局语义的同时减少输入冗余，显著提高了计算和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展语言模型到更长上下文对于捕捉扩展语篇中的丰富依赖关系至关重要，但简单的上下文扩展会带来显著的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: 提出CCF框架，整合分段语义聚合和键值记忆编码，形成紧凑表示；引入训练效率优化策略，结合增量分段解码和稀疏储层采样来减少内存开销。

Result: 在多个长上下文语言建模基准测试中，CCF在高压缩比下实现了有竞争力的困惑度，相比现有方法显著提高了吞吐量和内存效率。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩对于可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模具有巨大潜力，CCF框架为解决长上下文建模的效率问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation
systems and mitigating bias introduced by self-promotional language. The

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,
domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer
structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach
leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a
multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer
extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and
71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\%
and 27\% respectively. This paper details our methodology, experimental
results, and alternative approaches, providing insights into the strengths and
limitations of LLM-driven Table QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了监督学习在专利-SDG分类中的应用，现有方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化性

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，使用NPL引用作为噪声信号，开发复合标注函数，利用LLM从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念，计算跨域相似度并采用基于排名的检索方法

Result: 内部验证显示方法优于包括transformer模型和零样本LLM在内的多个基线，外部验证通过专利引用、共同发明人和共同申请人网络的模块化分析显示更好的主题、认知和组织一致性

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以大规模增强SDG分类，为跟踪创新如何应对全球挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG是一个针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的实时无监督黑盒幻觉检测框架，通过事实分解、变异生成、上下文验证和分数聚合来检测幻觉，特别适用于身份敏感的高风险领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的特殊挑战，而RAG在企业应用中部署日益广泛但可靠性受限。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)将答案分解为原子事实；2)使用同义词和反义词替换生成受控变异；3)根据检索上下文验证变体（同义词应被蕴含，反义词应被矛盾）；4)将不一致性惩罚聚合成响应级幻觉分数。

Result: 在企业专有数据集上的实验证明了MetaRAG在检测幻觉和实现RAG对话代理可信部署方面的有效性。

Conclusion: MetaRAG为RAG系统提供了实用的幻觉检测解决方案，特别适用于身份敏感查询，支持span级定位和阈值配置，有助于可信AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类比推理是人类认知的重要方面，但NLP领域通常不从认知科学的角度看待这些过程，需要建立认知理论与NLP研究的联系

Method: 总结认知科学文献中类比推理的关键理论，将其与NLP概念进行关联分析，并探讨这些理论对NLP主要挑战的相关性

Result: 成功建立了认知科学类比推理理论与NLP研究的联系框架，展示了这些理论对多个NLP挑战的适用性

Conclusion: 认知视角可以帮助NLP研究者更好地优化文本中的关系理解，减少对实体层面相似性的过度依赖，为提升模型的关系推理能力提供理论指导

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图线性化方法标签空间较大，需要更高效的编码方式来减少标签空间同时保持结构信息，以改进依赖图解析的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用层次括号编码将依赖图转换为序列表示，通过n个标注动作实现线性时间解析，能够处理重入、循环和空节点等复杂结构。

Result: 在多语言多形式基准测试中表现出竞争力，在精确匹配准确率上相比其他方法有持续改进。

Conclusion: 层次括号编码是一种实用的依赖图解析方法，能够有效减少标签空间并保持结构完整性，在准确性和效率方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM置信度估计方法要么计算开销大，要么校准效果差，难以在实际应用中可靠部署。需要一种可扩展且可靠的实时置信度估计方法。

Method: 提出GrACE方法，通过模型最后一个隐藏状态与词汇表中特殊标记嵌入的相似性来表达置信度，并通过与准确性相关的校准目标对模型进行微调。

Result: 在三个LLM和两个基准数据集上的实验表明，GrACE在开放式生成任务中具有最佳判别能力和校准效果，优于六种竞争方法，且能显著减少测试时缩放所需的样本数量。

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了一种实用、可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计解决方案，能够提高最终决策的准确性并减少计算开销。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Motivation: 解决简历推荐系统中职位匹配的挑战，传统方法基于词汇相似性但存在局限性，需要捕捉更深层的语义相关性。

Method: 自监督混合架构，结合密集句子嵌入和领域特定知识图谱，使用图神经网络进行KG集成，并采用分层评估方法将STR分数连续体分为低、中、高三个区域。

Result: KG增强的微调SBERT模型在高STR区域表现最佳，RMSE相比强基线降低了25%，证明了KG与文本嵌入结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 分层性能分析方法比全局指标更能揭示模型优缺点，KG与文本嵌入的结合在HR系统中对公平性、可解释性和上下文匹配至关重要。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Result: ICL能有效预测注释者特定标注，将这些预测聚合成软标签可获得有竞争力的性能；LDL方法在软标签预测方面表现良好

Conclusion: 上下文学习和标签分布学习方法都是处理观点主义标注的有效途径，LDL方法值得观点主义社区进一步探索

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting

three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological

Method: 提出人格检测模型，利用GPT零样本能力从论坛介绍帖推断大五人格特质，并与现有模型进行性能对比，集成到SAMI的实体匹配系统中

Result: 模型在该任务中表现出有效性，人格特质可以补充现有匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特质能够增强社交推荐，但需要进一步评估其对学生参与度和匹配质量的全面影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

Method: 引入EXPRESS基准数据集（包含251个细粒度情感标签），通过系统测试主流LLMs在不同提示设置下的表现，将预测情感分解为8种基本情绪进行细粒度比较

Result: LLMs准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的结果仍然具有挑战性；某些LLMs能生成符合情感理论的术语，但在捕捉上下文线索方面不如人类自我披露有效

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在细粒度情感对齐方面的局限性，为未来增强其上下文理解能力的研究提供了见解

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源有限地区缺乏医学证明时的死因识别问题，通过结合先进技术提高证言查调的准确性

Method: 使用LA-VA流水线，结合GPT-5大语言模型、传统算法方法和嵌入分类技术，在PHMRC数据集上进行多种方法比较

Result: GPT-5在三个年龄组中都获得最高性能：成年人48.6%、儿童50.5%、新生儿53.5%，比传统统计机器学习基准提高5-10%

Conclusion: 直接使用商业大语言模型可以显著提高证言查调的准确性，对低资源设施的全球健康监测具有重要意义

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: MOAT是一个多智能体联合对齐调优框架，通过迭代对齐提升智能体协作能力，在六个基准测试中平均提升3.1%-4.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调各智能体，导致能力差距和协调性差，需要改进多智能体系统的协作效果

Method: 提出MOAT框架，包含两个关键阶段：规划智能体对齐（优化子目标生成）和基础智能体改进（使用自生成数据增强泛化能力）

Result: 在六个基准测试中超越最先进基线，在held-in任务上平均提升3.1%，在held-out任务上平均提升4.4%

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐方法有效提升多智能体协作性能，理论分析证明其训练过程非递减且渐进收敛

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA)和Attention-Based Peeking (ABP)技术，在心理数学任务中识别出了一个All-for-One子图(AF1)，发现有意义计算主要发生在深层和最后一个token，且该子图对模型性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在心理数学任务中的内部工作机制，探索模型是否真正利用了所有前序token的信息进行计算。

Method: 采用三步骤方法：抑制初始层的输入特定token计算、限制中间层token位置间的信息传递、强制剩余层所有计算在最后一个token进行，并提出了CAMA和ABP两种技术。

Result: 识别出的AF1子图在各种心理数学任务上具有高准确性，计算主要发生在深层和最后一个token，该子图对模型性能是充分必要的，且在不同模型和输入风格间具有可迁移性。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理数学任务中的计算模式呈现集中化特征，关键计算发生在特定深层位置，CAMA和ABP技术为理解模型内部机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: SteerMoE框架通过检测和控制MoE模型中的行为相关专家，无需重新训练即可调控模型的安全性和忠实度等行为表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型缺乏对专家行为的细粒度控制，需要一种无需重新训练就能调控模型行为的方法

Method: 通过检测对比行为输入对中的专家激活模式差异，识别行为相关专家，在推理时选择性激活/停用这些专家

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个LLM上，安全性提升最高+20%，忠实度提升+27%；对抗模式下安全性下降-41%，与越狱方法结合可完全绕过安全防护

Conclusion: MoE模型中存在隐藏的对齐伪造维度，SteerMoE揭示了通过专家操控实现模型行为控制的新途径

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力时存在探索不足、过早收敛和熵崩溃的问题，需要更好的探索机制

Method: 使用演员对生成响应的困惑度和评论家多头架构的价值估计方差作为好奇心信号，作为RLVR框架内的探索奖励来引导模型

Result: 在AIME基准上相比标准RLVR(GRPO/PPO)获得约3个百分点的提升，并识别出RLVR中的校准崩溃机制

Conclusion: CDE框架通过内在好奇心信号有效改善了RLVR的探索问题，理论分析显示该方法能惩罚过度自信错误并促进正确响应的多样性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

Motivation: 随着多模态检索在LLMs和多模态LLMs中的快速发展，出现了越来越复杂的检索任务。现有方法主要依赖于视觉语言模型的任务特定微调，且仅限于单模态查询或文档，无法满足多模态检索需求。

Method: ReT-2利用多层表示和循环Transformer架构，采用LSTM启发的门控机制，动态整合跨层和跨模态的信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同检索配置下始终达到最先进的性能，同时提供更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。在检索增强生成管道中集成时，还能提升Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集的下游性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Motivation: 人类能够识别不同物种、视角和上下文中的相同动作，但当前深度学习模型在此类泛化方面存在困难

Method: 使用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过Transformer进行聚合，特别采用早期时间步的条件模型来强调语义信息而非像素细节

Result: 在跨物种、跨视角和跨上下文三个泛化基准测试中都达到了新的state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合Beta混合相似性异常检测框架(Beta-SOD)，使用二元交叉熵、对比损失和余弦嵌入损失联合优化

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: Beta-SOD方法在噪声Re-ID场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为解决标签噪声问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像具有低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构的特点，现有方法面临重大挑战。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块(CASE)突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块(PHFP)，通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构增强和频域细节处理的创新结合，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的技术难题，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: 集成自动化分割算法和桌面学生存分析可以提供准确、注释效率高且可解释性的盲肠肝转移植预后预测方案

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Method: 提出CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现一个模型比另一个模型更常出现的视觉属性，并找出与这些视觉差异相关的提示概念

Result: 创建了ID2数据集（60个输入依赖差异），CompCon在比较流行文本到图像模型时发现分歧表示，如PixArt对孤独提示的湿街道描绘和SD3.5对非裔媒体职业人士的描绘

Conclusion: CompCon能有效识别模型间的视觉表示差异，为理解生成模型的行为差异提供了系统化方法

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Conclusion: 该研究提出的机器学习方法为UAS水体遥感图像处理提供了有效的解决方案，提高了水质参数估算的准确性

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Swin Transformer全局注意力机制的新型视觉Transformer架构，通过在注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，有效解决了ViT在小数据集上局部特征提取不足的问题，在多个图像分类基准上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然通过自注意力机制建模长距离依赖取得了优异效果，但在小数据集上过度关注全局上下文而忽略了局部特征提取，缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，在分层移位窗口注意力机制基础上融合局部卷积特征学习。在每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个基准测试中均取得性能提升：CIFAR-10提升2.17%、CIFAR-100提升4.92%、MNIST提升0.10%、SVHN提升0.26%、Tiny ImageNet提升4.47%，优于最先进的卷积和基于Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，证明了结合卷积归纳偏置与Transformer架构的优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习，实现了高精度的点云配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云配准方法在特征匹配时缺乏几何一致性约束，需要一种能够同时考虑局部和全局几何一致性的可微匹配框架。

Method: 使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，通过双向最近邻搜索进行重定位，最后通过全局几何一致性学习预测点对匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI、KITTI-360、3DMatch等数据集上达到SOTA性能，内点率分别达到95%-97%、94%-97%和81.1%。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过可微框架有效提升了点云配准的精度和鲁棒性，在不同场景下都表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和视图依赖性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统隐式表示方法在超声图像重建中对精确标注的依赖，以及超声视图依赖性和声学阴影伪影导致的重建困难

Method: 采用基于占据率的表示方法，提出UltrON框架，利用B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，并设计新的损失函数补偿视图依赖性

Result: UltrON能够减轻遮挡和稀疏标注的限制，提高几何一致性，并可泛化到相同解剖结构的不同形状

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建铺平了道路，代码和数据集将公开提供

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 自动量化心肌内运动和应变从标记MRI是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要准确且可扩展的分析方法

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的条件隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，获得了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)与径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，比最准确基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适用于大型CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring
inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method
achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了增强型互学习网络（E-MLNet），通过动态加权策略改进通用域自适应，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，稀释了学习信号，需要更聚焦的适应策略

Method: 集成动态加权策略到开放集熵最小化（OEM），利用闭集分类器预测聚焦于最相关的类别边界

Result: 在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分DA和19个开放集DA任务上优于MLNet基线

Conclusion: 动态加权策略有效提升了已知和未知类别的区分能力，证明了聚焦适应策略的优越性

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为拥有2.5亿使用者的语言，在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏资源，缺乏大规模高质量数据集限制了乌尔都语系统的发展，并加剧了多语言视觉语言模型对高资源语言的偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集通过分层采样获得5.9万张图片，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，采用混合多模态质量评估框架（包括COMET-Kiwi翻译质量评估、CLIP视觉相似性、BERTScore语义一致性），使用开源大语言模型迭代优化低质量字幕。

Result: 构建了包含31.9万条乌尔都语字幕的大规模数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF基准测试中均获得强劲结果，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu填补了乌尔都语多模态研究的资源空白，通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，有助于减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling
reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on
subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes
Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects
included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing
methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as
promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实图像生成模型缺乏明确的归纳偏置来保护精细的解剖细节，难以生成解剖学上合理的脑MRI图像，这限制了合成MRI在研究细微形态差异中的应用。

Method: 提出概率因果图模型(PCGM)，将体素级解剖约束作为先验集成到生成扩散框架中，通过概率图模块捕获解剖约束并转换为空间二进制掩码，使用3D ControlNet编码掩码来约束新的反事实去噪UNet，最终通过3D扩散解码器生成高质量脑MRI。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PCGM生成的脑结构MRI质量优于多个基线方法。首次证明从PCGM生成的反事实图像中提取的脑测量结果能够复制疾病对皮层脑区的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM在合成MRI用于研究细微形态差异方面取得了重要里程碑，为脑MRI研究提供了高质量的图像合成工具。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Conclusion: Med3DInsight为无需人工标注的可扩展多模态3D医学表示学习提供了新范式，可无缝集成到现有3D医学图像理解网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg是一种零样本分割方法，无需训练即可从俯视图像中分割莲座状植物个体，通过结合基础分割模型和视觉语言模型来提取叶片实例并推理植物结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础分割模型能够零样本提取俯视作物图像中的叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然具有挑战性。传统的分层分割任务需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 整合基础分割模型（提取叶片实例）和视觉语言模型（推理植物结构），无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Result: 在多个植物物种、生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估，该方法超越了现有零样本方法，并比监督方法具有更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本植物个体分割解决方案，减少了人工标注需求，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，将CLIP应用于行人表征学习，提出了WebPerson数据集和GA-DMS框架，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在行人表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：(1)缺乏大规模标注的行人中心视觉语言数据；(2)全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征，且容易受到噪声文本标记的影响。

Method: 1) 利用MLLM的上下文学习能力构建噪声抵抗的数据管道，自动过滤和标注网络图像，创建了包含500万高质量行人图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，基于梯度-注意力相似性分数自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并引入掩码标记预测目标来增强细粒度语义表征学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过协同改进数据构建和模型架构，成功将CLIP应用于行人表征学习，解决了数据稀缺和全局对比学习局限性问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标记数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与使用更大数据集训练的模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中均表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、灵活且可解释的基础模型解决方案，在多种临床任务中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)在从数据推断拓扑结构方面的噪声鲁棒性，探索ANN在拓扑估计中的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方体复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试

Result: ANN在噪声条件下优于PH方法，这归因于ANN能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验知识

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但ANN在结构噪声下的拓扑估计为PH提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

TL;DR: OSIM是一个新的3D场景评估指标，专注于对象层面的感知评估，比现有指标更符合人类视觉感知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。基于神经心理学研究，人类对3D场景的识别主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的'对象性'，进行以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更接近人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性，重新评估了最新的3D重建和生成模型

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估标准，有助于澄清该领域的技术进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有综述主要按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集对架构演化的结构性影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，从数据集特征的角度重新解读视频理解模型的发展历程。

Method: 采用数据集驱动的方法论，分析运动复杂性、时间跨度、层次化组合和多模态丰富性等数据集特征如何为模型施加归纳偏置，并重新诠释从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型等里程碑工作。

Conclusion: 通过将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到一个连贯的框架中，本综述不仅提供了全面的回顾，还为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性的路线图，强调模型设计应与数据集不变性对齐，同时平衡可扩展性和任务需求。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

TL;DR: OCELOT 2023挑战赛通过提供多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集，验证了细胞-组织相互作用理解对提升细胞检测性能的重要性，最佳模型相比仅细胞检测基线F1分数提升7.99。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学家在检查全切片图像时会在不同放大倍数间切换以评估组织形态和细胞细节，但现有深度学习细胞检测模型难以模拟这种行为并学习不同尺度结构间的相互依赖语义。该领域的关键障碍是缺乏多尺度重叠细胞和组织标注数据集。

Method: OCELOT 2023挑战赛收集了来自306个TCGA全切片图像的673对标注数据，包含六个器官的重叠细胞检测和组织分割标注，分为训练、验证和测试子集。参与者开发了能够理解细胞-组织关系的模型。

Result: 顶级参赛模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型，F1分数提升了高达7.99，这是对传统仅细胞检测方法的显著性能改进。

Conclusion: 研究证明了将多尺度语义纳入模型的必要性，细胞-组织相互作用的理解对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，OCELOT 2023挑战赛加速了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，需要提升检测精度同时保持实时性能。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样(AU/AD)双路径机制，减少特征层传播误差；2. 采用CSP-PAC特征融合技术，使用并行空洞卷积处理局部和上下文信息，整合多尺度特征。

Result: 新设计的neck结构在小目标和密集目标检测中表现优越，在保持实时检测速度的同时不增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，解决了无人机图像目标检测的关键挑战。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接使用检索到的知识，忽视了知识冗余问题，导致回答过程中引入噪声

Method: 1）从图像-问题对中提取关键部分构建低噪声查询 2）使用大模型识别和提取有益回答的知识段落 3）采用选择性知识集成策略，仅在模型信心不足时才集成知识

Result: 该框架能够获取准确关键知识，并在广泛实验中超越了最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过知识聚焦和冗余知识消除策略，该无需训练的框架有效减少噪声干扰，提高了KB-VQA的回答准确性

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在地物分类中具有重要价值，但由于波段多、维度高、光谱混合等特点导致特征冗余问题突出，需要开发新的分类方法来突破传统方法的性能瓶颈

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像数据，提出CWSSNet框架：集成3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块整合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作

Result: 在余干县分类任务中，CWSSNet达到mIoU 74.50%、mAcc 82.73%、mF1 84.94%，在水体、植被和裸地分类中IoU最高，训练时间增加有限，小样本条件下性能可靠

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，突破了传统分类方法的性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本学习能力，为高光谱地物分类提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to

Conclusion: Dark-ISP提供了一种轻量级、自适应的解决方案，能够直接处理Bayer RAW图像并支持无绑终端到终端训练，为低光物体检测领域带来重要改进

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DATE方法，通过时间戳注入机制和时序感知相似性采样策略，增强多模态大语言模型的长视频时序理解能力，在7B和72B模型上都取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时序理解能力下降。

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时序感知相似性采样策略(TASS)：1)在视频帧嵌入中插入文本时间戳令牌构建连续时序参考系统；2)将视频采样重构为视觉-语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时序覆盖。

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中取得了显著改进，特别是在绝对时间理解和关键事件定位方面。7B模型甚至在某些基准上超越了72B模型。

Conclusion: DATE方法有效解决了长视频理解中的时序建模问题，通过显式时间参考和语义引导采样策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的时序推理能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割资源消耗大、现有高效模型静态设计缺乏适应性的问题，需要一种能平衡性能与效率的动态方法。

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现模型精简。

Result: 轻量版PSP-Seg-S在五个数据集上性能与nnU-Net相当，GPU内存减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%。

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型不仅可以学会如何推理，还可以学会动态选择最优的推理策略，为涉及多种理解方式的复杂任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M

FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Motivation: SAR图像中的目标与复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）在强度和模式上相似，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级slot注意力模块整合多级特征，增强slot-wise表征区分度。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法更好地保留了结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可获得清晰的目标表征。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Motivation: 解决现实场景中不同车辆模型异构性带来的挑战，现有方法需要联合训练或预先存储所有可能合作者模型，不切实际

Method: 提出渐进式异构协同感知(PHCP)框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时自训练适配器进行动态特征对齐

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在各种异构场景下都取得了强劲性能，仅使用少量无标签数据就达到与全数据集训练SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP首次证明了在推理时直接处理异构协同感知问题的可行性，无需联合训练或预先存储模型，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对双编码器视觉-语言模型在零样本图片分类中的语言导向和纯视觉推理能力进行了综合评估，并提出了一种基于精度的简单融合方法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉-语言模型在零样本分类中表现强劲，但其纯视觉推理能力仍未得到充分探索。需要综合评估语言导向和视觉仅依赖的分类方法的表现。

Method: 使用多种双编码器VLM模型（包括SigLIP 2和 RADIOv2.5）在ImageNet-1k数据集上进行评测，分析提示设计、类别多样性、k-NN近邻数量等因素对性能的影响，并提出基于精度的无学习融合方法。

Result: 语言和视觉拥有互补优势，不同类别适合不同的推理方式。融合方法能够提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 语言导向和视觉仅依赖的推理方式具有互补性，通过简单的融合方法可以有效利用这种互补性来提高图片分类的准确性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术技能评估(SSA)需要专家标注，成本高昂且耗时。少样本学习(FSL)提供了可扩展的替代方案，但预训练策略在SSA中尚未充分探索。

Method: 将SSA制定为少样本任务，评估不同自监督预训练策略。标注机器人手术数据集并使用OSATS评分，在三种少样本设置下评估各种预训练源，量化领域相似性并分析领域差距和手术特定数据的影响。

Result: 领域相关的小数据集表现优于大规模但不匹配的数据集，在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置下分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。加入手术特定数据后平均准确率提升1.22%，F1-score提升2.28%。

Conclusion: 预训练数据的领域相关性比数据规模更重要，适当整合手术特定数据能显著提升少样本手术技能评估性能，但需注意领域匹配度以避免性能下降。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果显示，该方法能够实现更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩散模型和PnP方法提供了统一的理论框架，通过混合数据一致性模块有效提升了逆问题解决的性能。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少操作变异性并整合多源信息，为临床ICP评估建立了可靠的非侵入性方法，有望改善急性神经系统疾病患者管理

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC制造中的缺陷，免需外部正常数据支持，具有良好的通用性和稳健性，适用于不同产品和布局变化的场景

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部成像诊断中可能存在捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的伪特征进行预测，当这些特征与保护属性（如种族、性别）相关时，会导致对弱势群体的性能偏见。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Result: 在各种任务上的实证研究有力地支持了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的CoTAP方法通过显式语义集中成功解决了密集自监督学习中的过度分散问题，在多个下游任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学的临床决策至关重要，需要一种能够在数据有限情况下生成生物学信息图像的方法。

Method: 使用常微分方程系统的机制模型捕捉肿瘤时间动态（包括放疗效果），结合梯度引导的DDIM进行图像合成，使生成图像与预测生长和患者解剖结构对齐。

Result: 在BraTS成人和儿童胶质瘤数据集上训练，在60个纵向儿童DMG病例上评估，生成具有空间相似性指标的逼真随访扫描，并提供肿瘤生长概率图。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限情况下实现生物学信息图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测，能够捕捉临床相关的肿瘤生长范围和方向性。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse方法能够有效处理任意数量的输入模态，在多种图像融合任务中都表现出优异的性能，具有很好的临床应用前景。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将人体运动分解为局部关节运动和全局根关节运动并分别处理，但这两部分并非独立，存在物理耦合关系。传统方法难以精确捕捉这种耦合，而从关节扭矩推导全局轨迹又计算复杂。

Method: 使用全身线性和角动量作为约束来连接局部运动与全局运动，引入新的损失函数来强制生成的运动动量分布与真实数据保持一致。

Result: 该方法减少了脚部滑动和抖动，改善了运动平衡性，同时保持了运动恢复的准确性。

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的建模问题。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了高的补丁级别准确率（例如96.34%），并生成了一致的区域级别对应关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为无注释沪漫线条图像的区域对应关系预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，显示了其在实际沪漫应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

TL;DR: DualTrack是一种新颖的双编码器架构，通过解耦的局部和全局编码器专门处理不同尺度的特征提取，用于从2D超声图像序列估计3D探头轨迹，实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，限制了其广泛应用。无传感器3D超声使用深度学习从2D图像序列估计探头轨迹，但现有方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法稳健地建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络（如2D CNN或基础模型）和时间注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征来估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，优于先前方法，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Conclusion: DualTrack通过解耦的局部和全局特征提取，有效解决了3D超声重建中的尺度特征建模问题，为无传感器3D超声提供了一种有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为基于语义的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Conclusion: HumbleBench填补了当前评估套件中的关键空白，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更现实的衡量标准

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: 通过自动编码器视角提出UAE框架，将图像理解与生成统一为编码器（I2T）和解码器（T2I），通过重建保真度进行双向训练，实现理解与生成的相互提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中理解与生成任务分离的问题，通过统一的重建目标实现双向信息流动，促进两者的相互增益。

Method: 提出UAE框架：先用大规模长上下文图片描述预训练解码器，然后通过Unified-GRPO加强学习三阶段（冷启动、生成促理解、理解助生成），使编码器生成更描述性的文本，解码器能够理解这些复杂描述并生成高保真图像。

Result: 在加强学习过程中，编码器自主生成更详细的图像描述，而解码器同时发展出理解这些复杂描述的深度能力，实现了骇人的重建保真度。还提供了第一个专门评估多模态统一度的测试集Unified-Bench。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的统一多模态学习范式，通过理解与生成的双向协同训练，实现了两者的相互提升，为多模态AI系统的统一化开发提供了有力的框架支撑。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Motivation: 现有VAE或扩散模型方法无法充分建模人体运动的几何结构和物理约束，需要一种能在底层关节几何空间上精确建模高阶运动动力学的先验模型。

Method: 在关节旋转、角速度和角加速度的乘积空间上构建神经距离场，提出自适应步长混合投影算法和几何积分器来生成物理合理的运动轨迹。

Result: 在AMASS数据集上训练后，NRMF在去噪、运动插值和2D/3D部分观测拟合等多个任务上表现出显著且一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的运动建模方法，为3D人体运动恢复提供了鲁棒且物理合理的解决方案，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Motivation: 现有研究认为扩散模型性能差距源于卷积网络的平移等变性和局部性归纳偏置，但本文质疑这一假设，认为局部性实际上是图像数据集的统计特性

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，证明最优参数化线性去噪器表现出与深度神经去噪器相似的局部性特征，并分析像素相关性如何导致局部性

Result: 发现局部性直接源于自然图像数据集中的像素相关性，基于此构建的解析去噪器比现有专家构建的替代方案更能匹配深度扩散模型的预测分数

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性主要是数据驱动的统计特性，而非网络架构的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于构建更准确的解析扩散模型

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

Conclusion: 简单的基于计数的嵌入方法在保持效果的同时，能够显著提高计算效率和表示可解释性，是一种替代复杂神经网络方法的有效方案。

Abstract: To obtain insights from event data, advanced process mining methods assess
the similarity of activities to incorporate their semantic relations into the
analysis. Here, distributional similarity that captures similarity from
activity co-occurrences is commonly employed. However, existing work for
distributional similarity in process mining adopt neural network-based
approaches as developed for natural language processing, e.g., word2vec and
autoencoders. While these approaches have been shown to be effective, their
downsides are high computational costs and limited interpretability of the
learned representations.
  In this work, we argue for simplicity in the modeling of distributional
similarity of activities. We introduce count-based embeddings that avoid a
complex training process and offer a direct interpretable representation. To
underpin our call for simple embeddings, we contribute a comprehensive
benchmarking framework, which includes means to assess the intrinsic quality of
embeddings, their performance in downstream applications, and their
computational efficiency. In experiments that compare against the state of the
art, we demonstrate that count-based embeddings provide a highly effective and
efficient basis for distributional similarity between activities in event data.

Conclusion: 该框架为关系数据库上的机器学习模型提供了有效的解释机制，通过控制粒度级别和权衡确定性与简洁性，实现了对复杂模型预测的可解释性分析。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

Abstract: Distributed systems require robust, scalable identifier schemes to ensure

outperform UUIDv4 and UUIDv7, reducing network overhead by 83.7% and increasing
generation speed by 97.32%. statistical analysis further shows ULIDs offer a
98.42% lower collision risk compared to UUIDv7, while maintaining negligible
collision probabilities even at high generation rates. These findings highlight
ULIDs as an optimal choice for high-performance distributed systems, providing

Conclusion: 机器学习结合优化调度算法能够有效提升云端GPU环境下变异检测工作负载的执行效率

Abstract: Variant calling is the first step in analyzing a human genome and aims to
detect variants in an individual's genome compared to a reference genome. Due
to the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are
increasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and
storage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this
paper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling
pipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit
(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach
for optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our
approach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to
predict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline
based on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,
the second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by
drawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans
are executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We
evaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences
using a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our
approach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling
pipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,
percentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our
approach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also
used ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.
Finally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic
approach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without
using any ML-based time predictions.

TL;DR: CoTAM是一个缓存一致性感知的任务图建模框架，通过解耦一致性影响、量化其权重并推断任务间依赖关系，为真实工作负载构建统一的任务图，解决了现有方法忽略缓存一致性的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 随着多核系统扩展，缓存一致性成为系统性能关键因素。现有任务图建模方法要么依赖隐式技术，要么生成针对固定调度模型的图，且往往忽略缓存一致性交互，导致设计假设与实际运行时行为存在差距。

Method: CoTAM框架通过三个步骤：1)解耦缓存一致性影响与整体执行；2)通过学习权重方案量化一致性影响；3)推断任务间依赖关系以生成一致性感知的任务图。

Result: 大量实验表明，CoTAM优于隐式方法，弥合了动态工作负载行为与现有设计之间的差距。

Conclusion: 将缓存一致性纳入任务图建模对于准确和可推广的系统级分析至关重要，CoTAM框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a
critical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task
execution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph
modeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as
the foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these
strategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world
applications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,
limiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task
graph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they
either rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features
without producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed
scheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often
overlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and
actual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a
Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that
constructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the
impact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,
quantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers
inter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive
experiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap
between dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the
importance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for
accurate and generalizable system-level analysis.

Abstract: Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to enable low-capability edge nodes to cooperatively execute
computation-intensive tasks. However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)
significantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation
latency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is
widely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two
critical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result
unless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which
seriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in
their encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and
numerical instability in the computational results. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on
barycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several
outstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any
returned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both
finite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its
encoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances
approximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning. Fourthly, it
integrates a novel BRI-based gradient coding algorithm accelerating the
training process while providing robustness against stragglers. Finally,
experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is superior to existing
CDC schemes in both waiting time and approximate accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可扩展到不对称信任系统中的其他核心问题解决。

Abstract: In distributed systems with asymmetric trust, each participant is free to
make its own trust assumptions about others, captured by an asymmetric quorum
system. This contrasts with ordinary, symmetric quorum systems and threshold
models, where trust assumptions are uniformly shared among participants.
Fundamental problems like reliable broadcast and consensus are unsolvable in
the asymmetric model if quorum systems satisfy only the classical properties of
consistency and availability. Existing approaches overcome this by introducing
stronger assumptions. We show that some of these assumptions are overly
restrictive, so much so that they effectively eliminate the benefits of
asymmetric trust. To address this, we propose a new approach to characterize
asymmetric problems and, building upon it, present algorithms for reliable
broadcast and consensus that require weaker assumptions than previous
solutions. Our methods are general and can be extended to other core problems
in systems with asymmetric trust.

TL;DR: TrEnv是一个针对LLM代理优化的高效无服务器平台，通过可重用沙箱和内存模板等技术，显著降低了启动延迟和内存使用，在容器和VM环境中都比现有系统表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无服务器计算基础设施对于LLM代理等新兴工作负载存在瓶颈，运行成本可高达LLM API调用成本的70%，需要更高效的高密度无服务器平台。

Method: TrEnv采用协同设计方法，支持容器和VM环境，通过可重用沙箱、内存模板实现快速环境重用和恢复，对VM工作负载还使用浏览器共享和页面缓存绕过机制。

Result: 评估显示TrEnv在容器环境中将P99延迟降低7倍，内存使用减少48%；在VM环境中P99延迟降低58%，内存节省61%，优于E2B等先进系统。

Conclusion: TrEnv通过创新的环境重用和优化技术，有效解决了LLM代理在无服务器平台上的性能瓶颈问题，为高密度计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure
overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which
exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our
analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless
platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding
motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We
present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container-
and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents.
TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes
and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution
environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv
leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations
show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in
container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61%
memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like
E2B.

*Diwen Xue,Armin Huremagic,Wayne Wang,Ram Sundara Raman,Roya Ensafi*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫dMAP的远程测量框架，通过行为指纹识别和分类深度包检查（DPI）设备，以应对网络干扰问题的普及化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DPI设备在网络中的普及和隐藏性，传统扫描工具无法有效检测和识别这些中间箱，需要新方法来进行主动挖掘和分析。

Method: 基于差分fuzzing技术，系统性地发现、选择和部署特殊探针，将DPI内部解析行为转换为外部可观测的指纹。

Result: 实验表明，仅需20-40个匿别性探针就能可靠地区分各种DPI实现，包括主要国家审查基础设施和商业DPI产品。

Conclusion: dMAP框架为网络DPI设备的主动挖掘提供了有效手段，该指纹方法不仅适用于审查识别，还可扩展到其他目标干扰形式的检测。

Abstract: Users around the world face escalating network interference such as
censorship, throttling, and interception, largely driven by the commoditization
and growing availability of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) devices. Once reserved
for a few well-resourced nation-state actors, the ability to interfere with
traffic at scale is now within reach of nearly any network operator. Despite
this proliferation, our understanding of DPIs and their deployments on the
Internet remains limited -- being network intermediary leaves DPI unresponsive
to conventional host-based scanning tools, and DPI vendors actively obscuring
their products further complicates measurement efforts.
  In this work, we present a remote measurement framework, dMAP (DPI Mapper),
that derives behavioral fingerprints for DPIs to differentiate and cluster
these otherwise indistinguishable middleboxes at scale, as a first step toward
active reconnaissance of DPIs on the Internet. Our key insight is that parsing
and interpreting traffic as network intermediaries inherently involves
ambiguities -- from under-specified protocol behaviors to differing RFC
interpretations -- forcing DPI vendors into independent implementation choices
that create measurable variance among DPIs. Based on differential fuzzing, dMAP
systematically discovers, selects, and deploys specialized probes that
translate DPI internal parsing behaviors into externally observable
fingerprints. Applying dMAP to DPI deployments globally, we demonstrate its
practical feasibility, showing that even a modest set of 20-40 discriminative
probes reliably differentiates a wide range of DPI implementations, including
major nation-state censorship infrastructures and commercial DPI products. We
discuss how our fingerprinting methodology generalizes beyond censorship to
other forms of targeted interference.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques play a pivotal role in optimizing
wireless communication networks. However, traditional deep learning approaches
often act as closed boxes, lacking the structured reasoning abilities needed to
tackle complex, multi-step decision problems. This survey provides a
comprehensive review and outlook of reasoning-enabled AI in wireless
communication networks, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other
advanced reasoning paradigms. In particular, LLM-based agents can combine
reasoning with long-term planning, memory, tool utilization, and autonomous
cross-layer control to dynamically optimize network operations with minimal
human intervention. We begin by outlining the evolution of intelligent wireless
networking and the limitations of conventional AI methods. We then introduce
emerging AI reasoning techniques. Furthermore, we establish a classification
system applicable to wireless network tasks. We also present a layer-by-layer
examination for AI reasoning, covering the physical, data link, network,
transport, and application layers. For each part, we identify key challenges
and illustrate how AI reasoning methods can improve AI-based wireless
communication performance. Finally, we discuss key research directions for AI
reasoning toward future wireless communication networks. By combining insights
from both communications and AI, this survey aims to chart a path for
integrating reasoning techniques into the next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: 基于机器学习的O-RAN框架，通过多阈值策略同时优化负载均衡和能源效率，避免传统方法导致的负载不均衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI/ML方法主要依靠载荷移除来实现能源效率，但这会导致网络负载不均衡，影响用户速率性能，需要同时解决负载均衡和能源效率的关键问题

Method: 提出一个综合的ML框架，将问题形式化为多类分类系统，预测性评估潜在的RU配置，将网络条件映射到三个负载均衡类别（良好均衡、中等均衡、不均衡），采用多阈值方法（保守、中等、激进）来满足不同的运营优先级

Result: 使用426万个实际网络测量数据进行实验评估，随机森林模型达到了98.3%的F1-macro性能，相比传统基准策略提升了195%

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效地同时优化O-RAN部署中的负载均衡和能源效率，通过预测性的多类分类和灵活的阈值策略，在保证网络性能的同时实现显著的能源节省效果

Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture provides an intrinsic
capability to exploit key performance monitoring (KPM) within Radio
Intelligence Controller (RIC) to derive network optimisation through xApps.
These xApps can leverage KPM knowledge to dynamically switch on/off the
associated RUs where such a function is supported over the E2 interface.
Several existing studies employ artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning
(ML) based approaches to realise such dynamic sleeping for increased energy
efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, most of these approaches rely upon offloading
user equipment (UE) to carve out a sleeping opportunity. Such an approach
inherently creates load imbalance across the network. Such load imbalance may
impact the throughput performance of offloaded UEs as they might be allocated a
lower number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Maintaining the same PRB
allocation while addressing the EE at the network level is a challenging task.
To that end, in this article, we present a comprehensive ML-based framework for
joint optimisation of load balancing and EE for ORAN deployments. We formulate
the problem as a multi-class classification system that predictively evaluates
potential RU configurations before optimising the EE, mapping network
conditions to three load balance categories (Well Balanced, Moderately
Balanced, Imbalanced). Our multi-threshold approach (Conservative, Moderate,
Aggressive) accommodates different operational priorities between energy
savings and performance assurance. Experimental evaluation using 4.26 million
real network measurements from simulations demonstrates that our Random Forest
model achieves 98.3% F1-macro performance, representing 195% improvement over
traditional baseline strategies.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种集成软件定义网络(SDN)原理的量子密钥分配(QKD)网络架构，通过虚拟KMS(vKMS)和量子安全控制器(QuSeC)解决KMS识别、中继路径发现和网络可扩展性挑战。

Conclusion: 该方案通过SDN化设计有效解决了QKD网络的关键技术挑战，为实现可扩展的量子安全通信网络提供了可行的架构支撑。

Abstract: With the advent of quantum computing, the increasing threats to security
poses a great challenge to communication networks. Recent innovations in this
field resulted in promising technologies such as Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD), which enables the generation of unconditionally secure keys,
establishing secure communications between remote nodes. Additionally, QKD
networks enable the interconnection of multinode architectures, extending the
point-to-point nature of QKD. However, due to the limitations of the current
state of technology, the scalability of QKD networks remains a challenge toward
feasible implementations. When it comes to long-distance implementations,
trusted relay nodes partially solve the distance issue through the forwarding
of the distributed keys, allowing applications that do not have a direct QKD
link to securely share key material. Even though the relay procedure itself has
been extensively studied, the establishment of the relaying node path still
lacks a solution. This paper proposes an innovative network architecture that
solves the challenges of Key Management System (KMS) identification, relay path
discovery, and scalability of QKD networks by integrating Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) principles, and establishing high-level virtual KMSs (vKMS) in
each node and creating a new entity called the Quantum Security Controller
(QuSeC). The vKMS serves the end-user key requests, managing the multiple KMSs
within the node and abstracting the user from discovering the correct KMS.
Additionally, based on the high-level view of the network topology and status,
the QuSeC serves the path discovery requests from vKMSs, computing the
end-to-end (E2E) relay path and applying security policies. The paper also
provides a security analysis of the proposal, identifying the security levels
of the architecture and analyzing the core networking security properties.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of mobile security protocols and limited availability of
current datasets constrains research in app traffic analysis. This paper
presents PARROT, a reproducible and portable traffic capture system for
systematic app traffic collection using Android Virtual Devices. The system
provides automated environment setup, configurable Android versions, traffic
recording management, and labeled captures extraction with human-in-the-loop
app interaction. PARROT integrates mitmproxy for optional traffic decryption
with automated SSL/TLS key extraction, supporting flexible capture modes with
or without traffic interception. We collected a dataset of 80 apps selected
from the MAppGraph dataset list, providing traffic captures with corresponding
SSL keys for decryption analysis. Our comparative analysis between the
MAppGraph dataset (2021) and our dataset (2025) reveals app traffic pattern
evolution across 50 common apps. Key findings include migration from TLSv1.2 to
TLSv1.3 protocol, with TLSv1.3 comprising 90.0\% of TCP encrypted traffic in
2025 compared to 6.7\% in 2021. QUIC protocol adoption increased substantially,
with all 50 common apps generating QUIC traffic under normal network conditions
compared to 30 apps in 2021. DNS communications evolved from predominantly
unencrypted Do53 protocol (91.0\% in 2021) to encrypted DoT protocol (81.1\% in
2025). The open-source PARROT system enables reproducible app traffic capture
for research community adoption and provides insights into app security

floating-point optimizations, notably due to fast math, at the LLVM IR level.
We present a preliminary work, which leverages the Verified LLVM framework in
the Rocq theorem prover, to prove the correctness of Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA)
optimization for a basic block implementing the arithmetic expression $a * b +
c$ . We then propose ways to extend this preliminary results by adding more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 依赖类型语言如Coq、Agda等允许编写详细程序规范，但这些规范在编译后被擦除，外部链接程序可能违反原始规范，即使使用验证编译器也无法避免。

Method: 开发类型保持编译方法，创建支持依赖内存分配的中间语言，以及依赖类型保持的编译器传递来处理内存分配问题。

Result: 本文是进行中的工作，提出了解决依赖类型语言编译后类型规范保持问题的框架和方法。

Conclusion: 通过类型保持编译和依赖内存分配支持，可以在链接时进行类型检查，防止与类型不正确的程序链接，确保编译后程序仍满足原始规范。

Abstract: Dependently typed programming languages such as Coq, Agda, Idris, and F*,
allow programmers to write detailed specifications of their programs and prove
their programs meet these specifications. However, these specifications can be
violated during compilation since they are erased after type checking. External
programs linked with the compiled program can violate the specifications of the
original program and change the behavior of the compiled program -- even when
compiled with a verified compiler. For example, since Coq does not allow
explicitly allocating memory, a programmer might link their Coq program with a
C program that can allocate memory. Even if the Coq program is compiled with a
verified compiler, the external C program can still violate the memory-safe
specification of the Coq program by providing an uninitialized pointer to
memory. This error could be ruled out by type checking in a language expressive
enough to indicate whether memory is initialized versus uninitialized. Linking
with a program with an uninitialized pointer could be considered ill-typed, and
our linking process could prevent linking with ill-typed programs. To
facilitate type checking during linking, we can use type-preserving
compilation, which preserves the types through the compilation process. In this
ongoing work, we develop a typed intermediate language that supports dependent
memory allocation, as well as a dependent-type-preserving compiler pass for
memory allocation.

Abstract: Pattern-based file access is a fundamental but often under-documented aspect
of computational research. The Python glob module provides a simple yet
powerful way to search, filter, and ingest files using wildcard patterns,
enabling scalable workflows across disciplines. This paper introduces glob as a
versatile tool for data science, business analytics, and artificial
intelligence applications. We demonstrate use cases including large-scale data
ingestion, organizational data analysis, AI dataset construction, and
reproducible research practices. Through concrete Python examples with widely
used libraries such as pandas,scikit-learn, and matplotlib, we show how glob
facilitates efficient file traversal and integration with analytical pipelines.
By situating glob within the broader context of reproducible research and data
engineering, we highlight its role as a methodological building block. Our goal
is to provide researchers and practitioners with a concise reference that
bridges foundational concepts and applied practice, making glob a default
citation for file pattern matching in Python-based research workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在GIS领域缺乏专业知识的限制，提高自动化地理信息系统的性能和可扩展性。

Method: 设计三组件架构：任务解析、游制协作和结果集成。Planner游制将自然语言转换为GeoJSON命令，Worker游制通过函数调用或代码生成处理空间数据。

Result: 在70个任务的测试中，函数调用方法达到85.71%准确率，代码生成方法达到97.14%准确率，显著超过通用模型(48.57%)。

Conclusion: 代码生成方法更灵活，函数调用方法更稳定。该研究首次引入LLM多游制框架处理GeoJSON数据，为提升GeoAI系统性能提供了新视角。

Abstract: LLMs have made substantial progress in task automation and natural language
understanding.However,without expertise in GIS,they continue to encounter
limitations.To address these issues, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a multi-agent
LLM architecture.This framework transforms natural language tasks into
structured GeoJSON operation commands and processes spatial data using two
widely adopted LLM enhancement techniques:Function Calling and Code
Generation.The architecture consists of three components-task parsing,agent
collaboration,and result integration-aimed at enhancing both the performance
and scalability of GIS automation.The Planner agent interprets natural language
tasks into structured GeoJSON commands.Then,specialized Worker agents
collaborate according to assigned roles to perform spatial data processing and
analysis,either by invoking predefined function APIs or by dynamically
generating and executing Python-based spatial analysis code.Finally,the system
integrates the outputs from multiple execution rounds into
reusable,standards-compliant GeoJSON files.To systematically evaluate the
performance of the two approaches,we constructed a benchmark dataset of 70
tasks with varying complexity and conducted experiments using OpenAI's GPT-4o
as the core model.Results indicate that the Function Calling-based GeoJSON
Agent achieved an accuracy of 85.71%,while the Code Generation-based agent
reached 97.14%,both significantly outperforming the best-performing
general-purpose model (48.57%).Further analysis reveals that the Code
Generation provides greater flexibility,whereas the Function Calling approach
offers more stable execution.This study is the first to introduce an LLM
multi-agent framework for GeoJSON data and to compare the strengths and
limitations of two mainstream LLM enhancement methods,offering new perspectives
for improving GeoAI system performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android恶意应用采用复杂的规避策略，将恶意逻辑隐藏在合法功能中，传统分析方法难以发现深度隐藏的行为或提供可解释的决策依据。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，首先生成方法级代码片段的摘要并建立向量索引，然后通过行为导向的查询检索相关代码片段进行深度分析，最后生成包含恶意行为及其代码实现的可读报告。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于更新的VirusTotal扫描和人工验证，该方法达到96%的恶意软件检测准确率和83.81%的行为识别准确率，专家评估确认了生成报告的实际效用。

Conclusion: TraceRAG框架成功地将自然语言查询与代码分析相结合，提供了可解释的恶意软件检测方案，在准确性和实用性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Sophisticated evasion tactics in malicious Android applications, combined
with their intricate behavioral semantics, enable attackers to conceal
malicious logic within legitimate functions, underscoring the critical need for
robust and in-depth analysis frameworks. However, traditional analysis
techniques often fail to recover deeply hidden behaviors or provide
human-readable justifications for their decisions. Inspired by advances in
large language models (LLMs), we introduce TraceRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that bridges natural language queries and Java code
to deliver explainable malware detection and analysis. First, TraceRAG
generates summaries of method-level code snippets, which are indexed in a
vector database. At query time, behavior-focused questions retrieve the most
semantically relevant snippets for deeper inspection. Finally, based on the
multi-turn analysis results, TraceRAG produces human-readable reports that
present the identified malicious behaviors and their corresponding code
implementations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 96\%
malware detection accuracy and 83.81\% behavior identification accuracy based
on updated VirusTotal (VT) scans and manual verification. Furthermore, expert
evaluation confirms the practical utility of the reports generated by TraceRAG.

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing

Abstract: Code comprehension and analysis of open-source project codebases is a task
frequently performed by developers and researchers. However, existing tools
that practitioners use for assistance with such tasks often require prior
project setup, lack context-awareness, and involve significant manual effort.
To address this, we present CLARA, a browser extension that utilizes a
state-of-the-art inference model to assist developers and researchers in: (i)
comprehending code files and code fragments, (ii) code refactoring, and (iii)
code quality attribute detection. We qualitatively evaluated CLARA's inference
model using existing datasets and methodology, and performed a comprehensive
user study with 10 developers and academic researchers to assess its usability
and usefulness. The results show that CLARA is useful, accurate, and practical
in code comprehension and analysis tasks. CLARA is an open-source tool
available at https://github.com/SaadNoor555/CLARA_tool_demo. A video showing

### [164] [Probing Pre-trained Language Models on Code Changes: Insights from ReDef, a High-Confidence Just-in-Time Defect Prediction Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09192)
*Doha Nam,Taehyoun Kim,Duksan Ryu,Jongmoon Baik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ReDef数据集，通过revert commits和GPT辅助筛选构建了高信度的软件缺陷预测数据集，并系统评估了预训练语言模型在代码修改理解方面的能力和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JIT-SDP数据集存在噪声标签和低精度问题，需要更可靠的数据集来支持软件缺陷预测研究。

Method: 通过revert commits标记缺陷修改，历史检查验证清洁修改，以及GPT辅助的多次投票审核过程构建高信度数据集。对CodeBERT、CodeT5+、UniXcoder进行微调，使用5种编码策略，并通过反事实扰动探针模型的敏感性。

Result: 缩略差分式编码在所有PLM中都较全函数格式更优，但反事实测试显示模型依赖表面线索而非真正语义理解，性能下降很少或不下降。

Conclusion: 与快照基于任务不同，当前的预训练语言模型在真正理解代码修改方面仍有限，需要更深入的研究来提升模型的语义理解能力。

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

*Ayelet Berzack,Guy Katz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合大语言模型和传统软件工程技术的方法论，通过场景化编程范式来提高LLM在软件开发中的可靠性和可验证性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM能大大缩短开发时间并生成组织良好的代码，但它们经常会引入重大错误以及以说服力强的自信展示错误代码，需要更可靠的方法来将LLM整合到软件开发周期中

Method: 提出结合LLM与传统软件工程技术的结构化方法，重点采用场景化编程（SBP）范式，让人类开发者能够注入专业知识并检查验证LLM的输出

Result: 通过Connect4游戏案例研究验证，创建了能够战胜现有强大组件的高能力组件，在某些情况下还能形式验证组件的正确性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效结合LLM和传统软件工程优势，提高开发效率咍代码质量，并提供了有趣的使用体验资览

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the
correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights
regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our
case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this
paper.

*Solal Rapaport,Laurent Pautet,Samuel Tardieu,Stefano Zacchiroli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这是首个大规模研究Git历史修改的论文，分析了1.22M个库的8.7M次历史重写，开发了GitHistorian工具来检测公开库中的历史修改问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查Git历史修改在公共代码库中的普遍性和影响，这些修改导致push/pull流程失效、娱子库完整性问题，为供应链攻击创造机会。

Method: 分析了111M个Software Heritage归档的库，识别和分类历史修改，包括修改位置（库、分支）和修改内容（文件或提交元数据），进行了两个特定案例研究。

Result: 发现1.22M个库存在8.7M次历史重写，常见情况包括追溯性修改许可证和删除漏泉的秘密信息，这些都是应避免的弊练。

Conclusion: 历史修改在公共库中普遍存在且带来安全风险，需要工具来识别和管理，GitHistorian能够自动检测并描述公开Git库中的历史修改。

Abstract: Version Control Systems (VCS) like Git allow developers to locally rewrite
recorded history, e.g., to reorder and suppress commits or specific data in
them. These alterations have legitimate use cases, but become problematic when
performed on public branches that have downstream users: they break push/pull
workflows, challenge the integrity and reproducibility of repositories, and
create opportunities for supply chain attackers to sneak into them nefarious
changes. We conduct the first large-scale investigation of Git history
alterations in public code repositories. We analyze 111 M (millions)
repositories archived by Software Heritage, which preserves VCS histories even
across alterations. We find history alterations in 1.22 M repositories, for a
total of 8.7 M rewritten histories. We categorize changes by where they happen
(which repositories, which branches) and what is changed in them (files or
commit metadata). Conducting two targeted case studies we show that altered
histories recurrently change licenses retroactively, or are used to remove
''secrets'' (e.g., private keys) committed by mistake. As these behaviors
correspond to bad practices-in terms of project governance or security
management, respectively-that software recipients might want to avoid, we
introduce GitHistorian, an automated tool, that developers can use to spot and
describe history alterations in public Git repositories.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究评估了CodeBERT在工业和开源软件中的漏洞检测性能，开发了AI-DO集成工具，并通过调查验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习漏洞检测方案在工业应用中的可及性和适用性不足，存在可信度、遗留系统、数字素养差距等问题。

Method: 评估CodeBERT在跨域泛化性能，使用欠采样技术处理类别不平衡，开发CI/CD集成的AI-DO推荐系统。

Result: 工业数据训练的模型在同域内检测准确，但在开源代码上性能下降；开源数据微调的深度学习模型通过欠采样技术提升了漏洞检测效果。

Conclusion: AI-DO系统能在不中断工作流的情况下有效检测和定位漏洞，得到了IT专业人士的认可。

Abstract: Deep learning solutions for vulnerability detection proposed in academic
research are not always accessible to developers, and their applicability in
industrial settings is rarely addressed. Transferring such technologies from
academia to industry presents challenges related to trustworthiness, legacy
systems, limited digital literacy, and the gap between academic and industrial
expertise. For deep learning in particular, performance and integration into
existing workflows are additional concerns. In this work, we first evaluate the
performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and
open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when
fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa,
also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results,
we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers'
Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated
recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise
vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we
assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT
professionals. Our results show that models trained on industrial data detect
vulnerabilities accurately within the same domain but lose performance on
open-source code, while a deep learner fine-tuned on open data, with
appropriate undersampling techniques, improves the detection of
vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究容器安全分析工具在面对不完整容器图像时的限制，提出了一种拦塞性强的分析方法ORCA，能够提高40%的文件覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发依赖开源库和第三方组件，容器化环境中容器文件系统的无意修改导致不完整图像，影响软件组件分析(SCA)工具的可靠性。

Method: 分析600个流行容器，提出拦塞性强的容器分析方法，并开发了开源工具ORCA(Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer)。

Result: 发现拦塞容器存在于知名注册表和可信图像中，许多工具无法分析这类容器。ORCA能有效检测拦塞容器内容，与Docker Scout和Syft相比文件覆盖率提高了40%。

Conclusion: 需要更加拦塞性强的SCA工具来应对不完整容器图像的安全风险，ORCA提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and
third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized
environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications,
this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or
vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments.
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify
and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional
modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container
images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we
examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when
faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed
that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and
that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we
propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and
introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source
implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate
channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of
obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage
compared to Docker Scout and Syft.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LoCoBench是一个专门评估长上下文LLM在复杂软件开发场景中表现的基准测试，包含8000个评估场景、10种编程语言、10K到1M token的上下文长度，涵盖8个任务类别和17个评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码评估基准主要关注单函数完成或短上下文任务，无法评估需要理解整个代码库、跨文件推理和保持架构一致性的长上下文能力，存在关键评估空白。

Method: 通过5阶段流水线系统生成多样化高质量场景，涵盖10种编程语言，上下文长度从10K到1M token，包含8个任务类别：架构理解、跨文件重构、多会话开发等。

Result: 对最先进长上下文模型的评估显示出显著的性能差距，表明复杂软件开发中的长上下文理解仍是一个重大未解决的挑战。

Conclusion: LoCoBench填补了长上下文LLM评估的关键空白，揭示了当前模型在复杂软件开发场景中的局限性，为该领域提供了全面的评估框架。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial
performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex
software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands
more attention. LoCoBench is released at:

*Zhenguang Liu,Lixun Ma,Zhongzheng Mu,Chengkun Wei,Xiaojun Xu,Yingying Jiao,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SmartDetector是一种新颖的智能合约函数相似性检测方法，通过将AST分解为语句树并进行细粒度比较，在三个真实数据集上平均F1分数达到95.88%，比现有方法提升14.01%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源代码重用虽然提高了编程效率，但显著放大了智能合约中的bug传播。现有的AST方法难以处理复杂树结构，而深度学习方法往往忽略代码语法和可解释性，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将智能合约函数的AST分解为一系列较小的语句树，每个语句树反映源代码的结构元素。使用分类器通过比较每对语句树来计算两个函数的相似度得分，并采用余弦扩散过程高效搜索最优超参数。

Result: 在三个大型真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，SmartDetector在F1分数上平均比当前最先进方法提高了14.01%，总体平均F1分数达到95.88%。

Conclusion: SmartDetector提供了一种在细粒度语句级别可解释的智能合约函数相似性计算方法，有效解决了现有方法在处理复杂树结构和语义比较方面的挑战。

Abstract: Widespread reuse of open-source code in smart contract development boosts
programming efficiency but significantly amplifies bug propagation across
contracts, while dedicated methods for detecting similar smart contract
functions remain very limited. Conventional abstract-syntax-tree (AST) based
methods for smart contract similarity detection face challenges in handling
intricate tree structures, which impedes detailed semantic comparison of code.
Recent deep-learning based approaches tend to overlook code syntax and
detection interpretability, resulting in suboptimal performance.
  To fill this research gap, we introduce SmartDetector, a novel approach for
computing similarity between smart contract functions, explainable at the
fine-grained statement level. Technically, SmartDetector decomposes the AST of
a smart contract function into a series of smaller statement trees, each
reflecting a structural element of the source code. Then, SmartDetector uses a
classifier to compute the similarity score of two functions by comparing each
pair of their statement trees. To address the infinite hyperparameter space of
the classifier, we mathematically derive a cosine-wise diffusion process to
efficiently search optimal hyperparameters. Extensive experiments conducted on
three large real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartDetector outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods by an average improvement of 14.01% in
F1-score, achieving an overall average F1-score of 95.88%.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 使用贝叶斯VAR模型分析不同排放情景下的温度预测，发现高排放情景下条件预测与无条件预测路径相似，而低排放情景下2040年后条件预测温度会低于无条件预测，但政策效果存在显著滞后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同气候驱动因素（如二氧化碳和甲烷排放）约束条件下的温度预测，为气候变化应对政策设计提供科学依据。

Method: 采用Chan等人(2025)提出的贝叶斯VAR框架，利用气候驱动因素的等式和不等式约束，进行条件温度预测直到2050年，并进行反事实情景分析（SSPs情景）。

Result: 高排放情景下条件预测与无条件预测路径相似；低排放情景下2040年后条件预测温度低于无条件预测轨迹，表明排放减少可显著减缓升温，但政策效果存在明显滞后。

Conclusion: 气候变化应对政策设计必须充分考虑排放变化对温度影响的显著滞后效应，低排放政策虽然有效但需要长期坚持才能显现效果。

Abstract: In this paper, using the Bayesian VAR framework suggested by Chan et al.
(2025), we produce conditional temperature forecasts up until 2050, by
exploiting both equality and inequality constraints on climate drivers like
carbon dioxide or methane emissions. Engaging in a counterfactual scenario
analysis by imposing a Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenario of
"business as-usual", with no mitigation and high emissions, we observe that
conditional and unconditional forecasts would follow a similar path. Instead,
if a high mitigation with low emissions scenario were to be followed, the
conditional temperature paths would remain below the unconditional trajectory
after 2040, i.e. temperatures increases can potentially slow down in a
meaningful way, but the lags for changes in emissions to have an effect are
quite substantial. The latter should be taken into account greatly when
designing response policies to climate change.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含兼容性摩擦的供应链形成新理论，分析专业化选择、生产复杂性和搜索摩擦如何共同决定供应链弹性，发现均衡状态下存在过度专业化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管政策关注度日益增长，但供应链弹性的决定因素仍未得到充分理解。需要建立理论框架来解释供应链在面对中断时的恢复能力。

Method: 建立供应链形成理论模型，引入兼容性摩擦概念，中间产品生产者选择专业化程度，在更高生产率和更少兼容最终生产者之间权衡。将供应链建模为需要采购多个互补投入品的复杂生产过程。

Result: 相对于有效配置，均衡状态存在过度专业化问题，这是由于摩擦市场、内生专业化和复杂生产相互作用产生的新型网络外部性所致。过度专业化使供应链在正常时期更高效，但在中断时弹性低于社会期望水平。

Conclusion: 有针对性的交易补贴可以实现供应链的有效弹性分散化，同时需要审视设定兼容性标准的影响。过度专业化虽然提高生产效率但降低弹性，需要政策干预来平衡这一权衡。

Abstract: Despite growing policy interest, the determinants of supply chain resilience
are still not well understood. We propose a new theory of supply chain
formation with compatibility frictions: only compatible inputs can be used in
final good production. Intermediate producers choose the degree of
specialization of their goods, trading off higher productivity against a lower
share of compatible final producers. We model supply chains as complex
production processes in which multiple complementary inputs must be sourced for
final production to take place. Specialization choices, production complexity,
and search frictions jointly determine supply chain resilience. Relative to the
efficient allocation, the equilibrium is characterized by over-specialization
due to a novel network externality arising from the interplay between
frictional markets, endogenous specialization, and complex production.
Over-specialization makes supply chains more productive in normal times but
less resilient to disruptions than socially desirable. We show how a targeted
transaction subsidy can decentralize efficient resilience in supply chains, and
examine the implications of setting compatibility standards.

Motivation: 慢性病日益流行对全球减贫、健康公平和医疗费用控制构成挑战。研究旨在探索患者如何在住院和门诊服务之间做出权衡，特别是弱势群体是否做出不同选择，以及减贫项目对医疗决策的影响。

Method: 使用中国农村县的健康保险索赔数据，采用结构模型分析方法，研究不同人群在住院和门诊服务之间的权衡选择，并进行反事实分析。

Result: 弱势人群倾向于避免门诊服务，除非能显著降低医疗费用；普通人群更愿意承担更高费用使用门诊预防疾病。当前主要补贴住院的扶贫政策导致门诊使用减少23%，医疗成本增加，患者福利下降46.2%。

Conclusion: 降低门诊服务的自付比例比提供交通补贴更能有效改善健康结果和支持弱势群体，是更符合成本效益的策略。

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases poses a significant challenge
to global efforts to alleviate poverty, promote health equity, and control
healthcare costs. This study adopts a structural approach to explore how
patients manage chronic diseases by making trade-offs between inpatient care
and ambulatory care outpatient services. Specifically, it investigates whether
disadvantaged populations make distinct trade-offs compared to the general
population and examines the impact of anti-poverty programs that reduce
inpatient cost-sharing.
  Using health insurance claims data from a rural county in China, the study
reveals that disadvantaged individuals tend to avoid ambulatory care unless it
substantially lowers medical expenses. In contrast, the general population is
more likely to prioritize ambulatory care, even at higher costs, to prevent
disease progression. The findings also indicate that current anti-poverty
insurance policies, which focus predominantly on hospitalization, inadvertently
decrease ambulatory care usage by 23\%, resulting in increased healthcare costs
and a 46.2\% decline in patient welfare. Counterfactual analysis suggests that
reducing cost-sharing for ambulatory care would be a more cost-effective
strategy for improving health outcomes and supporting disadvantaged populations
than providing travel subsidies.

Method: 使用自我报告信念和民间传说中的环境主题进行实证分析，结合理论框架解释文化传承如何塑造对环境稳定性的先验信念。

Result: 发现祖先气候异常强度与后代环境关注度呈U型关系，气候稳定性和极端不稳定性都导致更高的环境关注。

Conclusion: 对环境的学习具有双重目的：优化利用典型条件和防范极端事件，祖先的气候经验通过文化传承塑造后代对环境稳定性的认知和关注程度。

Abstract: How does the climatic experience of previous generations affect today's
attention to environmental questions? Using self-reported beliefs and
environmental themes in folklore, we show empirically that the realized
intensity of deviations from typical climate conditions in ancestral
generations influences how much descendants care about the environment. The
effect exhibits a U-shape where more stable and more unstable ancestral
climates lead to higher attention today, with a dip for intermediate
realizations. We propose a theoretical framework where the value of costly
attention to environmental conditions depends on the perceived stability of the
environment, prior beliefs about which are shaped through cultural transmission
by the experience of ethnic ancestors. The U-shape is rationalized by a double
purpose of learning about the environment: optimal utilization of typical
conditions and protection against extreme events.

Motivation: 解决非凸偏好下的最优风险分担问题，利用代理连续性诱导的凸性来克服传统方法需要偏好凸性的限制。

Conclusion: 多代理性自然产生凸性，使得凸对偶技术可应用于非凸偏好的风险分担问题，提供了计算可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the optimal risk sharing problem with a continuum of agents,
modeled via a non-atomic measure space. Individual preferences are not assumed
to be convex. We show the multiplicity of agents induces the value function to
be convex, allowing for the application of convex duality techniques to risk
sharing without preference convexity. The proof in the finite-dimensional case
is based on aggregate convexity principles emanating from Lyapunov convexity,
while the infinite-dimensional case uses the finite-dimensional results
conjoined with approximation arguments particular to a class of law invariant
risk measures, although the reference measure is allowed to vary between
agents. Finally, we derive a computationally tractable formula for the
conjugate of the value function, yielding an explicit dual representation of
the value function.

Abstract: This paper builds a finite-horizon model to study the role of physical
collateral in a model of strategic defaults, when the borrower can develop
reputation for honesty. Asset ownership increases attractiveness of the
reputational channel: the borrower who would prefer to remain in autarky in the
absence of the asset prefers to apply for collateralized debt. Pledging the
asset as collateral facilitates reputation building, which is especially
successful at the times of asset price drops, because these are the times when
default is most tempting. The complementarity between secured and unsecured
lending is especially pronounced when the ratio of the borrower's financial to
non-financial income is neither too large nor too small.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 发送者与接收者群体间的策略性信息传递模型，显示聚合收益外部性导致利益冲突，完全信息披露不可行，但发送者偏好偏差可改善公共信息提供和福利


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发送者与多个接收者之间的策略性信息传递问题，分析当接收者收益依赖于发送者信息时的沟通动态和福利影响

Method: 建立理论模型，分析发送者与接收者群体间的策略性信息传递，考察聚合收益外部性对信息披露的影响，探讨发送者偏好偏差的作用

Result: 聚合收益外部性在发送者与接收者之间创造了内生的利益冲突，使得完全信息披露通常不可行；但发送者存在外生偏好偏差时，反而可以改善公共信息提供并提高福利水平

Conclusion: 信息传递中的利益冲突阻碍完全信息披露，但适度的发送者偏好偏差可能通过改善信息提供机制来提升整体福利，这一发现对理解策略性沟通有重要启示

Abstract: This paper develops a model in which a sender strategically communicates with
a group of receivers whose payoffs depend on the sender's information. It is
shown that aggregate payoff externalities create an endogenous conflict of
interests between the sender and the receivers, rendering full information
revelation, in general infeasible. We demonstrate that an exogenous bias in the
sender's preferences can improve public information provision and raise
welfare. Two applications of the setup are discussed.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 研究带有道德成本的囚徒困境博弈，分析信念多样性对合作的影响：在低信任环境中阻碍合作，在高信任环境中促进合作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在诚实类型玩家和道德成本的情况下，玩家对彼此诚实信念的明确认知如何影响合作行为，与完全不确定信念的情况进行对比

Method: 采用两玩家博弈模型，在标准囚徒困境基础上引入诚实类型玩家和道德成本，分析不同信任水平下信念多样性对合作的影响

Result: 发现信念多样性在信任水平较低的环境中会阻碍合作，而在信任水平较高的环境中会促进合作

Conclusion: 信念多样性对合作的影响取决于环境中的信任水平，为理解社会合作机制提供了新的理论洞见

Abstract: This paper studies a two-player game in which the players face uncertainty
regarding the nature of their partner. In this variation of the standard
Prisoner's Dilemma, players may encounter an 'honest' type who always
cooperates. Mistreating such a player imposes a moral cost on the defector.
This situation creates a trade-off, resolved in favor of cooperation if the
player's trust level, or belief in their partner's honesty, is sufficiently
high. We investigate whether an environment where players have explicit beliefs
about each other's honesty is more or less conducive to cooperation, compared
to a scenario where players are entirely uncertain about their partner's
beliefs. We establish that belief diversity hampers cooperation in environments
where the level of trust is relatively low and boosts cooperation in
environments with a high level of trust.

### [179] [The value of conceptual knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09170)
*Benjamin Davies,Anirudh Sankar*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文形式化定义了统计决策环境中的概念性知识，这种知识让智能体能够理解状态之间的结构关系，通过特征组合来表示状态，并在状态更可约简时更有价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究概念性知识在统计决策中的价值，探索知识如何帮助智能体在数据有限的情况下做出更好的决策，特别是当状态具有可约简结构时。

Method: 通过形式化定义概念性知识，分析知识在状态可约简性、数据数量和质量等不同条件下的价值变化。

Result: 发现概念性知识的价值随数据量和质量呈非单调变化，在无限数据时价值消失；知识深度越深的智能体可以用更少数据达到相同福利水平，这在状态高度可约简时尤其明显。

Conclusion: 概念性知识在有限数据环境下具有重要价值，特别是对于具有可约简结构的状态，深度知识可以显著减少数据需求并提高决策效率。

Abstract: We formalize what it means to have conceptual knowledge about a statistical
decision-making environment. Such knowledge tells agents about the structural
relationships among unknown, payoff-relevant states. It allows agents to
represent states as combinations of features. Conceptual knowledge is more
valuable when states are more "reducible": when their prior variances are
explained by fewer features. Its value is non-monotone in the quantity and
quality of available data, and vanishes with infinite data. Agents with deeper
knowledge can attain the same welfare with less data. This is especially true
when states are highly reducible.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 研究使用简单语言（分数）进行廉价谈话时，发送者通过聚合多维状态的分数进行沟通，双方共享二次损失函数的相同收益。分数限制引入了战略考虑，导致均衡收益低于承诺评分规则下的收益，且均衡分数必须为线性或离散形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在多维状态下使用简单语言（分数）进行沟通时的战略互动，分析分数限制如何影响发送者和接收者之间的信息传递效率。

Method: 通过理论分析研究廉价谈话模型，证明均衡分数必须为线性或离散形式，并在正态分布状态假设下完全刻画线性均衡分数的集合。

Result: 发现分数限制会降低均衡收益（低于承诺评分规则下的收益），证明均衡分数只能是线性或离散的，并在正态分布下完整描述了线性均衡分数的特征。

Conclusion: 简单语言（分数）的使用在廉价谈话中引入了重要的战略约束，限制了信息传递效率，均衡结果可能显著偏离最优承诺方案。

Abstract: We study cheap talk with simple language, where the sender communicates using
a score that aggregates a multidimensional state. Both the sender and the
receiver share the same payoffs, given by a quadratic loss function. We show
that the restriction to scores introduces strategic considerations. First,
equilibrium payoffs can be strictly lower than those achievable under
commitment to a scoring rule. Second, we prove that any equilibrium score must
be either linear or discrete. Finally, assuming normally distributed states, we
fully characterize the set of equilibrium linear scores, which includes both
the ex-ante best and the worst linear scores.

### [181] [Heterogeneous Agents in the Data Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09656)
*Yongheng Hu*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文定义了数据经济中数据投资者的投资能力及其异质性，构建了异质代理人模型，证明投资能力差异导致经济结果分化。高能力投资者能获得更大效用、更强投资激励、更高生产力和技术进步，以及更低金融摩擦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据经济分析主要使用代表性代理人模型，无法充分捕捉投资者异质性。本文旨在扩展分析框架，从代表性代理人模型转向异质代理人模型，为数据经济研究提供理论基础。

Method: 构建分析性异质代理人模型，通过理论建模和数学分析来研究数据投资能力的异质性及其经济影响。

Result: 分析证明：数据投资能力更高的投资者能通过数据投资获得更大效用，因此有更强激励进行更大规模数据投资，从而实现更高生产力、技术进步，并经历更低金融摩擦。

Conclusion: 投资者数据投资能力的异质性是影响数据经济结果的重要因素，高能力投资者在数据经济中具有显著优势，这为从代表性代理人模型向异质代理人模型的框架扩展提供了理论前提。

Abstract: In this short paper, we define the investment ability of data investors in
the data economy and its heterogeneity. We further construct an analytical
heterogeneous agent model to demonstrate that differences in data investment
ability lead to divergent economic results for data investors. The analytical
results prove that: Investors with higher data investment ability can obtain
greater utility through data investment, and thus have stronger incentives to
invest in a larger scale of data to achieve higher productivity, technological
progress, and experience lower financial frictions. We aim to propose a
prerequisite theory that extends the analytical framework of the data economy
from the currently prevalent representative agent model to a heterogeneous
agent model.

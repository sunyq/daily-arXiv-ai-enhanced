### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的知识图谱补全（KGC）事后解释性方法，通过多目标优化框架平衡解释的有效性和简洁性，并改进了评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGC的事后解释性缺乏形式化和一致的评估，阻碍了研究的可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过多目标优化统一现有的事后解释性算法，并改进评估协议（如使用Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@k）。

Result: 通过统一方法和优化评估标准，提升了KGC解释性的可重复性和实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 本文的工作为KGC解释性研究提供了统一的方法和评估标准，使其更具可重复性和影响力。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据准备原则（DRAI）如何应用于领导级科学数据集以训练基础模型，提出了一个针对高性能计算环境的两维准备框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决科学数据在AI训练中的预处理挑战，特别是针对跨领域的标准化和可扩展性需求。

Method: 方法包括分析四个代表性领域的工作流程，提出数据准备级别和处理阶段的两维框架，并强调生成模型的应用。

Result: 结果是一个概念性的成熟度矩阵，用于评估科学数据的准备状态并指导基础设施开发。

Conclusion: 结论是该框架为跨领域科学数据的标准化和可扩展AI训练提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力提升的同时会加剧社会偏见。通过实验比较三种去偏策略，发现强化学习结合1:4的去偏与推理样本比例能有效平衡偏见减少与推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MLLMs在提升推理能力时如何避免社会偏见的增加，以及两者是否存在权衡关系。

Method: 比较三种去偏策略（监督微调、知识蒸馏、规则强化学习），并调整去偏与推理样本比例。

Result: 强化学习结合1:4的去偏与推理样本比例能减少10%的偏见，同时保留88%的推理准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为MLLMs在公平性与能力之间的平衡提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上表现极差，失败率超过93%。研究通过听觉图灵测试揭示了AI在选择性注意力、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并探索失败原因。

Method: 引入包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，涵盖七类任务，评估了GPT-4和Whisper等先进模型。

Result: AI模型最高准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%，揭示了其在复杂听觉场景中的根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究为迈向人类水平机器听觉提供了诊断框架，并指出需整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [6] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出并定义了‘论证一致性’的概念，要求预测者的推理与预测一致。通过实验验证，过滤不一致预测能提高人类和LLM预测的准确性，但用户实验显示用户通常不符合这一特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究论证结构对预测的影响，提出‘论证一致性’以提升预测准确性。

Method: 定义‘论证一致性’，并通过人类和LLM预测实验及用户实验验证其效果。

Result: 过滤不一致预测显著提高准确性，但用户通常不符合一致性要求。

Conclusion: 论证一致性在预测中有实用价值，需在群体预测中过滤不一致意见。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [7] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于Shapley值的责任度量（WSMS）在ontology-mediated查询中的计算复杂性，发现其在某些查询类中具有多项式数据复杂度，但在其他情况下则变得困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中各事实的贡献是重要问题，但现有方法在ontology-mediated查询中的复杂性尚未充分研究。

Method: 利用数据库结果分析WSMS的计算复杂性，探索不同查询类和本体语言的影响。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂度；对于支持合取的本体语言，计算变得困难。DL-Lite方言中某些受限查询类仍可高效计算。

Conclusion: WSMS的计算复杂性取决于查询类和本体语言，通过结构限制可实现高效计算。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [8] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分治策略的方法，通过部分MILP调用和新型ReLU评分机制（SAS）优化神经网络验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂神经网络验证问题，减少二进制变量数量并保持准确性。

Method: 结合分治策略、部分MILP调用和新型ReLU评分（SAS及GS），并与α,β-CROWN结合使用。

Result: SAS减少二进制变量数量约6倍，验证器效率提升40%，未解决实例降至8-15%。

Conclusion: SAS和混合MILP方法显著提升验证效率和准确性，适用于大规模CNN。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is propelling automated
scientific discovery to the next level, with LLM-based Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Scientist systems now taking the lead in scientific research. Several
influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems,
with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025

changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer
this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

Motivation: 探讨AI完全自主的风险，尤其是超级智能（ASI）可能带来的威胁，强调人类监督的重要性。

Method: 通过理论分析（自主性、AI和智能体理论）、12个论点、6个反驳及其回应，以及15个案例证据支持观点。

Result: 提出3级自主AI分类，论证完全自主AI（第3级）的风险，强调人类监督的关键作用。

Conclusion: AI不应完全自主，人类监督是规避风险的必要条件。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Result: LLM4Rail能够生成准确的铁路服务响应，并提供个性化餐饮推荐。

Conclusion: LLM4Rail通过LLM和QTAO框架有效提升铁路服务的个性化和智能化水平。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

Motivation: 现有自动合成方法在指令多样性和难度上存在不足，需要减少人工标注依赖。

Method: 采用Micro-Scatter-Macro多级注视方法，引导LLM从无监督文本中挖掘细粒度信息。

Result: 在多个无监督语料库和模型架构上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在因果推断中的表现，发现基于推理的架构在因果发现任务中表现优于传统方法，并提出了一种模块化上下文管道以进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在因果发现任务中的潜力，解决传统模型在此任务中的过拟合和性能不稳定问题。

Method: 使用OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型家族在Corr2Cause基准上进行因果发现，并引入基于Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts的模块化上下文管道。

Result: 推理优先架构在因果发现任务中表现显著优于传统方法，模块化管道将性能提升近三倍。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型在因果发现中具有显著优势，但需结合结构化上下文框架以最大化其潜力，为跨领域因果发现提供通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果关系的解释方法，适用于图像分类器，具有形式化严谨性和黑盒算法的兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释方法缺乏形式化严谨性，而逻辑解释虽严谨但假设严格，不适用于图像分类器。

Method: 提出因果解释方法，证明其形式化性质，并引入对比性因果解释和置信度感知的完整因果解释。

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上有不同模式，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式化严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Conclusion: DICE为LLM代理提供了一种通用、理论支持的示例选择方法，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

Motivation: 传统方法中代理的记忆模块容量有限，影响了记忆回忆的完整性和性能。受记忆理论的启发，通过有效线索主动激活相关记忆。

Method: 设计了5W回忆地图分类记忆查询场景，定义15种回忆策略模式，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索算法优化策略选择和响应生成。

Result: 实验表明，MemoCue在回忆灵感方面优于基于LLM的方法17.74%，人类评估也验证了其在记忆回忆应用中的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的Recall Router框架和MemoCue代理在记忆回忆任务中表现出色，为代理辅助记忆回忆提供了新思路。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Conclusion: TextQuests为开发更强大的AI代理提供了新的评估标准，推动其在复杂环境中的自主推理能力发展。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Conclusion: Seed-Prover展示了形式化验证与长链推理的有效性，推动了自动数学推理的进步。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Method: 在CALEIDOHOTELS平台上集成并评估Mistral 7B（QLoRA微调）和Mixtral 8x7B（优化系统提示）的性能。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6%）、精确度（98.8%）和幻觉率（1.2%）上优于Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高。

Conclusion: 研究为生产环境中LLM的部署提供了质量与资源效率的权衡指导，证明了其在提升数据可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

Result: 实验显示，经过微调和知识增强的小模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性上优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为电力营销客服领域的大模型开发提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Conclusion: TeQoDO为提升LLM解释性提供了新方向，展示了本体在LLM中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

Result: 实验表明，混合框架能生成更受控且与词汇表对齐的主题词预测。

Conclusion: 结合ML与LLM的混合方法能有效提升主题分析的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

Result: 在OAEI竞赛中表现优异，且在新数据集上验证了三重匹配的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂上下文中具有竞争力，为知识图谱集成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统RAG在处理需要跨时间追踪的查询时表现不足，因为其检索方法缺乏时间连贯性。

Method: 将查询分解为主题和时间窗口，使用专用检索器平衡语义匹配和时间相关性，确保证据集的连续性和时间跨度。

Result: 在ADQAB基准测试中，新方法比标准RAG准确率提高了13%至27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为RAG系统提供了处理复杂、实时问题的能力，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型规模差异是否影响其内部概念的相似性，为跨模型可解释性提供基础。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）分析残差流激活，通过激活相关性对齐特征，并用SVCCA和RSA比较特征空间。

Result: 中间层特征重叠最强，早期和晚期层相似性较低；多令牌子空间分析显示语义相似的子空间与模型交互方式相似。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在不同规模下仍能生成相似的可解释特征，支持特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种模型预测临床试验中的严重不良事件（SAE）结果，利用注册信息提前预测，以优化试验设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，避免试验终止和减少参与者风险，优化临床试验设计。

Method: 分析了22,107项临床试验数据，开发了分类模型（预测SAE率高低）和回归模型（预测SAE比例），采用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）和滑动窗口方法处理长文本。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在分类任务中AUC为77.6%，回归任务中RMSE为18.6%。滑动窗口方法显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 利用ClinicalTrials.gov的摘要数据可提前预测SAE结果，改进试验设计并发现预期与实际结果的差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，需要将连续多模态数据转换为适合语言处理的离散表示，但目前缺乏对VQ技术在LLM中应用的系统性调查。

Method: 提出了首个针对LLM的离散标记化方法的结构化分类法，分析了8种代表性VQ变体的算法原理、训练动态及与LLM管道的集成挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为高效且通用的多模态系统开发提供了基础参考，并提出了动态量化等未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型成本高、易产生幻觉信息的问题，避免资源浪费。

Method: 提出LMC算法，通过级联多个语言模型，仅接受候选答案中的正确响应，错误响应输入更慢但更准确的模型。

Result: 在医疗文档中提取患者出生日期时，LMC显著提高了速度和准确性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: LMC算法为知识提取领域提供了重要贡献，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交媒体情绪（如Reddit的r/wallstreetbets）是否能有效预测股价变动。

Method: 使用两种现有文本情绪分析方法，并引入基于ChatGPT标注和微调的RoBERTa模型，结合相关性和因果性指标评估预测能力。

Result: 社交媒体情绪与股价相关性较弱，评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。

Conclusion: 传统情绪分析可能无法完全捕捉市场驱动因素，零售投资者行为复杂。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

Result: 实验表明，优化的提示策略显著改善了跨语言知识共享，提升了分类任务性能。

Conclusion: 建议在多语言资源（尤其是低资源语言）共享和跨语言提示优化中更广泛地应用这些策略。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着国际学生在美研究生计算机课程中的比例增加（2023年占硕士学位的60.2%），且许多课程为在线英语授课，研究语言背景对同伴反馈体验的影响。

Method: 使用Twitter-roBERTa模型分析500名学生的同伴反馈情感，并结合语言背景、性别和年龄进行统计。

Result: 母语者对反馈评分较低，非母语者反馈更积极但收到较少正向反馈；语言背景在控制性别和年龄后显示出复杂影响。

Conclusion: 语言背景对同伴反馈体验有微妙但显著的影响，需在在线教育设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

Motivation: 现有记忆存储和检索方法在结构化组织和高效检索方面存在不足，影响了LLM代理的决策能力和上下文连贯性。

Method: 采用分层记忆架构（H-MEM），基于语义抽象程度多级组织记忆，嵌入位置索引编码，并通过索引路由机制逐层检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务中，H-MEM方法优于五种基线方法，尤其在长期对话场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: H-MEM通过分层组织和高效检索机制，显著提升了LLM代理的长期记忆能力和任务性能。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均有重要意义，推动了全局上下文建模和多句子推理的发展，并提升了实际应用中的关系检测性能。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注RAG系统的整体性能，缺乏对LLM特定能力的系统性和细粒度评估，尤其是在文档利用方面。

Method: 通过引入多层次的细粒度基准测试，包括多级过滤能力、组合能力和参考推理能力，并采用基于占位符的创新方法，分离LLM的参数化知识和外部知识的贡献。

Result: 实验表明，代表性LLMs在RAG系统中的生成能力存在局限性，特别是在错误恢复和上下文忠实度方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

Motivation: 探讨链式思维（CoT）提示生成的“思维”是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，提取Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B模型在GSM8K数学问题中的单义特征。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，CoT特征显著提升答案概率，激活稀疏性和特征可解释性更高；70M模型无显著效果。

Conclusion: CoT提示在高容量模型中能诱导更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，主要源于知识不足、视觉定位能力有限及多模态数据稀缺，现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段的多代理框架（知识检索、任务案例研究和结果验证）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Result: 生成了一个合成PII标注数据集，并验证了其可重现性、不可链接性和不可区分性。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究PII隐私风险提供了可复现的工具，并公开了数据集和代码。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

TL;DR: ACC-RAG动态调整压缩率，优化检索增强生成的推理效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩率方法无法适应查询复杂度，导致效率低下或信息损失。

Method: 结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，动态调整压缩率，保留最小充分信息。

Result: 在Wikipedia和五个QA数据集上表现优于固定率方法，推理速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法，适用于复杂查询场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: 通过系统文献综述，论文分类了提升视觉语言理解的技术，展示了神经符号系统的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Motivation: 由于大语言模型在金融分析中的快速发展和广泛应用，但缺乏系统比较，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究使用10-K文件，设计了领域特定提示，并通过人工标注、自动语义度量（如ROUGE、余弦相似度）和模型行为诊断（如提示级方差和跨模型相似性）三种方法评估模型表现。

Result: GPT在连贯性、语义对齐和上下文相关性上表现最佳，Claude和Perplexity次之，Gemini和DeepSeek表现不稳定且输出一致性较低。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的输出质量和稳定性受提示设计和源材料影响显著，需进一步优化提示工程以提高模型表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单一模型受限于领域知识，无法满足多样化任务需求，而多模型协作在AIOps中潜力巨大。

Method: 提出CoE-Ops框架，结合大型语言模型和检索增强生成机制，处理高低级任务。

Result: 在DevOps-EVAL数据集上，CoE-Ops在高阶任务路由准确率提升72%，单模型准确率提升8%，优于MoE模型14%。

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架有效解决了AIOps中多样化任务处理的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术文档中的问答（QA）常涉及流程图等图像内容，传统文本RAG系统难以处理此类问题。

Method: 通过VLM提取流程图的图表示，并将其整合到文本RAG系统中，实现图像检索。方法包括文档处理、图像分类、图表示构建及与文本嵌入管道的结合。

Result: 实验表明，基于微调VLM的图表示与真实值的编辑距离更小，检索性能良好，且无需在推理阶段使用VLM，降低了成本。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了技术文档中基于流程图的QA问题，提升了检索性能并降低了部署成本。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在中间推理步骤中存在的隐性事实错误问题，避免高风险领域中的误导性决策。

Method: 结合事实检查分类器、GRPO强化学习方法和机制解释模块，优化推理过程的事实性和结构正确性。

Result: 在十种先进模型中，RELIANCE显著提升事实准确性（最高49.90%），同时保持或提升基准测试表现。

Conclusion: RELIANCE为未来通过激活引导优化提升事实鲁棒性的训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

Motivation: 现有生存分析方法难以有效处理文本数据的复杂性，尤其是时序形式的临床报告。

Method: SigBERT通过提取和平均词嵌入生成句子嵌入，利用粗糙路径理论提取签名特征，并结合LASSO惩罚Cox模型进行风险评分。

Result: 在真实肿瘤数据集上测试，C-index得分为0.75（标准差0.014）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序医疗数据，提升了基于叙事的生存分析能力。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Result: NLP辅助审查减少了40%的每图表审查时间，多波抽样避免了77%的图表审查，且不影响测量精度。

Conclusion: 该方法可促进代码算法的常规验证，增强数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Conclusion: 任意性是一种结构性机制，保护权威免受问责，同时为跨领域系统（包括人工智能）的功能提供了新理解。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Motivation: 现有研究对SDMs在实际对话中的有效性缺乏全面理解，尤其是与文本LLMs相比，而语音交互因歧义性和上下文依赖性更具挑战性。

Method: 构建包含1079个中英文实例的基准数据集，并开发基于LLM的评估方法，以模拟人类判断。

Result: 数据集和评估方法为SDMs的性能提供了全面分析工具，揭示了其在处理语音对话复杂性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了SDMs评估的空白，为未来优化提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨当代LLMs是否能处理数学文本的自然语言推理（Math NLI）任务，构建了由人类专家标注的数据集，并评估LLMs生成假设的表现。发现LLMs在部分场景下表现接近人类，但仍存在数学语言理解的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在数学文本推理任务中的能力，填补Math NLI领域的研究空白。

Method: 构建人类标注的Math NLI数据集，并对比LLMs生成假设的表现，分析模型间一致性。

Result: LLMs在多数投票下表现接近人类，但数学语言理解仍有缺陷；新一代模型减少了假设主导的推理错误。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI任务中有潜力但仍需改进，提供数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文学习（ICL）的方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行框架语义解析（FSP），无需微调模型，通过自动生成任务特定提示实现竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索无需微调模型的方法，利用ICL和LLMs完成框架语义解析任务，减少对传统微调的依赖。

Method: 方法包括自动生成任务特定提示（基于FrameNet数据库），用于框架识别（FI）和框架语义角色标注（FSRL），并在暴力事件相关框架子集上测试六种LLMs。

Result: 实验结果显示，FI的F1得分为94.3%，FSRL为77.4%，表明ICL在领域特定FSP任务中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 结论认为ICL为领域特定FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代方案，无需传统微调。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARoPE是一种动态生成位置编码的新方法，通过结合上下文信息改进了RoPE，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE虽然高效，但其静态频率模式限制了上下文敏感关系的建模能力。

Method: CARoPE通过动态生成与token嵌入相关的频率模式，引入上下文敏感的位置表示。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE显著降低了困惑度，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了一种可扩展、表达力强且高效的位置编码方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

Motivation: 解决现有模型在编辑时缺乏全局一致性的问题，提出一种能够跨领域保持语义和视觉一致性的编辑框架。

Method: 采用Reward-Refine（推理时奖励引导细化）和RewardDPO（训练时奖励对齐布局对优化）两种策略。

Result: 在SMARTEdit-Bench基准测试中表现优于基线模型，RewardDPO在结构化场景中提升15%，Reward-Refine在自然图像中表现更优。

Conclusion: 奖励引导的规划能有效生成语义一致且视觉对齐的编辑结果，自动和人工评估均验证了其价值。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于组件检索的架构，用于解决大规模数据库中的自然语言接口扩展问题，无需领域微调即可实现高效表识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大语言模型的自然语言数据库接口有所进展，但扩展到企业级数据目录仍是一个未充分探索的挑战。现有方法依赖领域微调且未充分利用数据库元数据的语义上下文。

Method: 引入组件检索架构，将数据库模式和元数据分解为离散语义单元并分别索引，以实现针对性检索，同时控制检索表的数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高召回率和准确性上表现优异，优于基线方法，适用于结构和元数据多样的大规模数据库。

Conclusion: 该方案解决了自然语言数据库接口的可扩展性问题，无需专门微调即可在企业环境中部署实用的文本到SQL系统。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在遇到歧义文本时的可信度问题，尤其是中文文本歧义，以揭示其局限性。

Method: 创建包含歧义句及其消歧对的基准数据集，分为3大类9小类，通过实验分析LLMs的行为。

Result: LLMs无法可靠区分歧义文本，对歧义文本表现出过度自信和过度思考，与人类行为差异显著。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在处理语言歧义时存在根本性限制，需改进方法以应对现实应用中的不确定性。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态之间的因果关系是现实环境中多模态模型的核心挑战。

Method: 引入ISO-Bench，通过图像和文本步骤的顺序判断任务评估模型。

Result: 前沿视觉-语言模型表现不佳，最佳零样本F1为0.57，人类为0.98。

Conclusion: 研究为提升多模态模型的因果理解提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过用户与语言模型的交互日志获取隐式用户反馈，分析其内容和极性对模型性能的影响，发现反馈内容对短问题有改进但对复杂问题效果有限，且反馈的有用性与用户初始提示质量相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不直接打扰用户的情况下，从用户与语言模型的长期交互中获取隐式反馈，以持续优化模型性能。

Method: 分析WildChat和LMSYS两个用户-LM交互数据集中的隐式反馈，研究反馈内容和极性对模型性能的影响，并评估其在短问题（MTBench）和复杂问题（WildBench）上的效果。

Result: 反馈内容（如用户需要澄清）对短问题有改进，但对复杂问题效果有限；反馈的有用性与用户初始提示质量密切相关。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈在优化语言模型方面具有潜力，但其效果受反馈内容和用户初始提示质量的限制。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法（如投票或对数集成）忽略了模型在不同上下文中的置信度和可靠性差异，需要更精细的加权策略。

Method: LENS通过训练轻量级线性置信预测器，利用层间隐藏状态和归一化概率作为输入，动态加权模型预测。

Result: 在多项选择和布尔问答任务中，LENS显著优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为确定模型置信度提供了有价值的信息，可用于高效的集成学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化低层内核开发成为需求，以减少手动优化并提升性能。

Method: GEAK采用推理时计算缩放和Reflexion式反馈机制生成Triton代码。

Result: 在两项基准测试中，GEAK正确性达63%，执行速度提升2.59倍，优于前沿LLM和Reflexion基线。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了代理式代码生成在加速硬件平台采用和普及专家级内核性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注正样本的利用，忽略了负样本在上下文学习中的潜在价值。本文旨在通过结合负样本信息，优化正样本选择，从而提升ICL效果。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本库，通过语义相似度筛选与查询相关的正负样本，进一步从正样本库中检索与负样本相似的正样本，组合后作为ICL示例。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖最相似正样本的方法，验证了负样本信息对提升ICL性能的作用。

Conclusion: 负样本中的额外信息有助于优化正样本选择，从而显著提升少样本上下文学习的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

<details>

Motivation: 传统主题模型依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征，而神经变体虽使用更丰富的表示，但仍受限于词列表表达主题。

Method: MTMs利用稀疏自编码器学习可解释特征，并在这一语义丰富的空间中定义主题，同时支持基于主题的文本生成控制。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MTMs在一致性指标上与传统和神经基线相当或更优，且通过LLM评估框架更受青睐。

Conclusion: MTMs通过语义丰富的特征描述和可控生成能力，显著提升了主题模型的表达力和实用性。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期准确诊断需要分析多种异构生物标志物，LLM因其多模态整合和自然语言解释能力提供了新机会。

Method: 利用TableGPT2，通过上下文学习构建表格提示，并采用qLoRA微调，用于AD与认知正常（CN）的二元分类任务。

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLM应用于表格生物标志物数据预测任务，为未来生物医学信息学中的LLM驱动多智能体框架铺平道路。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Method: 引入P-ReMe数据集，定义隐含意义和预设现象，设计三项任务，并测试四个模型（Llama3.1、Mistral、MentaLLaMa、Qwen）。

Result: Mistral和Qwen在推理任务中表现突出；Claude-3.5-haiku在心理健康污名研究中表现更负责任。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理健康领域具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升推理能力和减少污名化问题。

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE模型中专家的重要性差异，揭示关键子集SEs的作用，填补现有研究对专家异质性理解的不足。

Method: 通过分析激活模式和修剪实验，识别并研究SEs的特征及其对模型性能的影响。

Result: SEs具有罕见但极端的激活特征，修剪会导致注意力分布破坏和性能下降，尤其在数学推理任务中。

Conclusion: SEs是MoE模型的关键组成部分，其压缩或修剪需谨慎，未来研究可进一步优化SEs的利用。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究分析了GPT-4o-mini在重述敏感内容时的隐性审查行为，发现其系统性地将内容调整为更温和的类别，并显著减少了贬义和禁忌语言。同时，评估了LLMs在零样本分类句子敏感性方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在没有明确指令的情况下是否会对语言进行隐性净化，填补了此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过实验分析GPT-4o-mini在重述敏感内容时的行为，并评估其零样本分类句子敏感性的能力。

Result: GPT-4o-mini系统性地将敏感内容调整为更温和的类别，显著减少了贬义和禁忌语言。LLMs在零样本分类任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLMs具有隐性审查能力，且零样本分类任务表现优异，为内容审核提供了新思路。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在音乐相关应用中表现受限，主要因为训练数据中音乐知识较少。

Method: 提出MusT-RAG框架，包括音乐专用向量数据库MusWikiDB，并在推理和微调阶段利用上下文信息。

Result: MusT-RAG在音乐领域适应能力上显著优于传统方法，MusWikiDB比通用维基百科语料库更高效。

Conclusion: MusT-RAG有效提升了LLMs在音乐领域的性能，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了MPCC基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态约束规划中的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准无法直接评估多模态现实规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束。

Method: 引入MPCC基准，包含三个现实任务（飞行、日历、会议规划）和复杂约束（预算、时间、空间），分难度级别评估。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅21.3%可行计划，开源模型低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供严格评估框架，凸显约束感知推理在现实应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

TL;DR: Causal2Vec是一种针对解码器专用大语言模型（LLM）的嵌入模型，通过预编码输入文本为单个上下文标记并优化池化策略，显著提升了性能，同时减少了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在移除因果注意力掩码或依赖额外输入文本时，可能损害模型语义提取能力或增加计算成本。

Method: 使用轻量级BERT风格模型预编码输入文本为上下文标记，并将其前置到LLM输入序列中，结合上下文和EOS标记的隐藏状态生成最终嵌入。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到最优性能，序列长度减少85%，推理时间减少82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在不改变LLM架构或显著增加计算开销的情况下，显著提升了嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

TL;DR: MRGSEM-Sum提出了一种基于多关系图和结构熵最小化的无监督多文档摘要框架，解决了现有方法在关系建模和自适应聚类上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档摘要的核心挑战是文档间复杂关系和信息冗余。现有方法通常仅考虑单关系图且需预定义聚类数量，限制了其性能。

Method: 构建多关系图整合语义和话语关系，应用二维结构熵最小化算法自动聚类，并引入位置感知压缩机制生成摘要。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于无监督方法，部分接近监督模型和大型语言模型。人工评估显示摘要质量接近人类水平。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum通过多关系图和结构熵最小化，显著提升了多文档摘要的质量和适应性。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语因其复杂的形态、可选变音符号以及现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言的并存，对NLP和IR提出了挑战，且研究资源不足。

Method: 采用增强的DPR框架，引入注意力相关评分（ARS）替代标准交互机制，结合预训练阿拉伯语言模型和架构优化。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了阿拉伯语在NLP和IR中的挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注被动批判性思维，即模型仅拒绝有问题的查询，而未能主动解决用户需求。本文旨在推动AI系统通过主动批判性思维更有效地协作解决问题。

Method: 提出主动批判性思维范式，并设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个新基准，基于GSM8K评估数学推理能力。使用强化学习算法提升模型表现。

Result: 实验显示，传统推理任务表现优秀的模型在主动批判性思维上表现不佳，但强化学习显著提升了Qwen3-1.7B在GSM-MC上的准确率（从0.15%到73.98%）。

Conclusion: 主动批判性思维能有效提升AI与用户协作解决问题的能力，强化学习是实现这一目标的有效方法。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可以通过微调实现角色特定的行为控制，为实际企业应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Result: LLM整体表现中等（总分57.2%），高风险场景性能下降13.3%，专业医学LLM表现更优。

Conclusion: CSEDB为LLM临床评估提供了标准化工具，有助于提升其在医疗环境中的安全性和有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

Conclusion: Med-R³通过联合优化检索与推理，在医学领域实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with

Conclusion: T-Detect为文本检测提供了新的理论基础，验证了其在对抗条件下的鲁棒性，并开源了代码。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Conclusion: DiffLoRA在特定任务中表现优异，但需进一步优化以提升广泛适用性。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，社交媒体中的仇恨言论识别变得日益重要，研究旨在解决阿拉伯语文本中的仇恨言论检测和清理问题。

Method: 针对仇恨言论检测，采用深度学习和Transformer模型进行实验；针对文本清理，将其视为机器翻译任务，输入含脏话的句子，输出掩码后的句子。

Result: 仇恨言论检测的最佳模型达到92%的宏F1分数和95%的准确率；文本清理任务的BLEU分数为0.3（1-gram）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在仇恨言论检测和清理任务中表现优异，优于现有技术水平。

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Devin Wingfield,Amin Ghasemi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型为知识图谱的逻辑规则生成自然语言解释的潜力，并通过实验验证了其正确性和清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱的逻辑规则难以理解，生成自然语言解释可提升其可解释性和实用性。

Method: 使用AMIE 3.5.1算法从多个数据集中提取逻辑规则，并尝试多种提示策略生成解释。

Result: 生成的解释在正确性和清晰度上表现良好，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成逻辑规则解释方面具有潜力，未来研究需进一步优化。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

*Yunxiang Yan,Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于级联问题披露的框架，用于更准确地评估LLMs的问题解决能力，同时保持可扩展性和自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QA基准测试是间接评估LLMs问题解决能力的方法，需要更直接且通用的评估框架。

Method: 采用级联问题披露方法，分阶段揭示问题信息，以激发LLMs的通用推理能力。

Result: 该方法不仅改进了LLMs之间的比较，还生成了更好的中间推理痕迹，缩小了标准QA评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 级联问题披露框架比标准QA评估更准确地反映了LLMs的实际能力，避免了高估模型间性能差异。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: 框架高效且鲁棒，适用于城市规模场景的重建与渲染。

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法生成的注视扫描路径多为平均行为，无法捕捉人类视觉探索的多样性。

Method: 结合扩散模型和Vision Transformers，利用扩散模型的随机性生成多样扫描路径，并引入文本条件实现任务驱动的生成。

Result: 在基准数据集上，ScanDiff在自由观看和任务驱动场景中均优于现有方法，生成更多样且准确的扫描路径。

Conclusion: ScanDiff能更好地捕捉人类视觉行为的复杂性，推动注视预测研究的发展。

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨深度学习超分辨率技术如何提升低质量超声心动图的分类准确性，证明其在资源受限环境中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限环境下超声心动图质量差，影响诊断模型效果，超分辨率技术在其他影像模态中有效，但在超声心动图中应用不足。

Method: 使用CAMUS数据集，按图像质量分层，评估2CH vs. 4CH和ED vs. ES分类任务，应用SRGAN和SRResNet模型增强图像。

Result: SRResNet显著提升分类性能，且计算高效，证明超分辨率能恢复低质量超声心动图的诊断价值。

Conclusion: 超分辨率技术可有效提升资源受限环境中超声心动图的诊断准确性，为AI辅助医疗提供实用工具。

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的NeRF框架（PATA），通过动态时间步长训练策略，在保持渲染质量的同时显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF模型在3D重建和渲染中表现优异，但依赖密集点采样导致计算资源消耗大，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用。脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其高效能特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出PATA框架，采用动态时间步长训练策略，自动平衡渲染质量和时间步长，实现场景自适应推理。

Result: 实验表明，PATA在保持渲染质量的同时，推理时间步长减少64%，运行功耗降低61.55%。

Conclusion: PATA为资源受限场景下的高效神经渲染提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that incorporating a consistency heuristic into the
point-matching algorithm \cite{yerebakan2023hierarchical} improves robustness
in matching anatomical locations across pairs of medical images. We validated
our approach on diverse longitudinal internal and public datasets spanning CT
and MRI modalities. Notably, it surpasses state-of-the-art results on the Deep
Lesion Tracking dataset. Additionally, we show that the method effectively
addresses landmark localization. The algorithm operates efficiently on standard

TL;DR: NovaDrive是一种单分支视觉语言架构，通过处理多模态输入（图像、地图、LiDAR和文本）和新型平滑损失函数，显著提升自动驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需快速反应并处理复杂路况，现有方法常依赖循环记忆，效率不足。

Method: 采用单分支架构，结合两阶段交叉注意力块和平滑损失函数，微调LLaMA-3.2视觉语言模型。

Result: 在nuScenes/Waymo子集上，成功率提升4%，路径效率提升0.11，碰撞频率降低1.4%。

Conclusion: NovaDrive不仅提升安全性，还通过更短路径减少能耗，适用于其他具身AI领域。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据收集成本高且复杂，合成数据方法在安全关键应用中变得重要，但需要高真实感和可控性。

Method: MObI利用扩散模型进行多模态对象修复，支持3D定位；AnydoorMed在医学图像中实现参考引导的异常修复。

Conclusion: 这些方法表明基础模型可适应多种感知模态，为构建高度真实和可控的多模态反事实场景铺平道路。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive是一个结合视觉、地图和路径点的单一模型，通过轻量级目标中心交叉注意力层实现高效自动驾驶，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要同时处理几何精度和语义理解，但现有方法通常分开处理。XYZ-Drive旨在通过单一模型整合多模态输入，提升驾驶性能和透明度。

Method: 使用视觉-语言模型，结合前摄像头帧、俯视地图和路径点，通过目标中心交叉注意力层融合信息，并部分微调LLaMA-3.2 11B模型。

Result: 在MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving基准测试中，XYZ-Drive达到95%成功率和0.80 SPL，优于PhysNav-DG 15%，碰撞率减半，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 早期、令牌级的多模态融合能实现准确、透明且实时的自动驾驶，验证了XYZ-Drive设计的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OV-3DIS方法中的概念虽互补但未结合，本文旨在通过整合这些概念并解决关键挑战，提升性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方案：1）基于3D跟踪的提案聚合生成3D提案，并通过迭代合并/移除处理重叠或部分提案；2）使用Alpha-CLIP替代标准CLIP模型，并引入标准化最大相似度（SMS）评分优化分类。

Conclusion: 通过整合互补概念并优化关键步骤，本文提出的方法显著提升了OV-3DIS的性能，成为新的SOTA解决方案。

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经逆向渲染方法，从多视角图像中联合重建几何、空间变化反射率和光照条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角光度立体方法需要光照校准或中间线索（如每视角法线图），而本方法直接从原始图像中联合优化所有场景参数。

Method: 使用神经隐式场表示几何和反射率，并应用阴影感知体积渲染。空间网络预测有符号距离和反射率潜在码，反射率网络基于潜在码和角度编码的法线、视角和光照方向估计反射率。

Result: 在形状和光照估计精度上优于现有方法，适用于视角未对齐的多光照图像，并能处理复杂几何和反射率的物体。

Conclusion: 该方法无需中间线索，单阶段优化所有参数，表现出色且通用性强。

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Conclusion: 多模态运动检索框架在提升运动获取的精度和用户体验方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的对抗攻击方法（AGD），通过向噪声中注入目标语义来欺骗多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击通常在高频段嵌入扰动，易被防御方法过滤。AGD旨在通过全频谱噪声注入提高攻击效果和鲁棒性。

Method: AGD在反向扩散过程中向噪声组件注入目标语义，利用扩散模型的全频谱特性，使对抗信号不易被低通滤波等防御方法抑制。

Result: 实验表明，AGD在攻击效果和对防御的鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGD通过噪声注入实现了高效且鲁棒的对抗攻击，为多模态模型的对抗防御提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了食品晶体聚集检测的挑战，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC在检测精度和轻量化方面表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,

research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，ALDC方法优于现有方法，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: GSemi-FSCIL框架和ALDC策略有效解决了广义半监督少样本类增量学习中的挑战，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值指标（如MSE）无法评估时间序列的几何结构，而几何结构对理解时间动态至关重要。

Method: 提出TGSI将时间序列转换为图像以评估几何结构，并设计SATL损失函数，结合一阶差分损失、频域损失和感知特征损失。

Result: 实验表明，使用SATL训练的模型在MSE和TGSI指标上均优于基线方法，且推理时无额外计算成本。

Conclusion: TGSI和SATL能有效提升时间序列预测的几何结构建模能力。

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

*Shuai Wang,Ziteng Gao,Chenhui Zhu,Weilin Huang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PixelNerd的单尺度、单阶段、端到端的解决方案，通过神经场建模解码，避免了传统两阶段训练中的累积误差和解码伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散变换器的成功依赖于预训练VAE的潜在空间，但两阶段训练会引入累积误差和解码伪影。现有方法返回像素空间但增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出PixelNerd框架，利用神经场表示进行解码，无需复杂级联或VAE。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256和512×512上分别达到2.15和2.84 FID，并在文本到图像任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PixelNerd是一种高效、端到端的解决方案，在图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何利用Segment Anything Model 2（SAM2）进行低成本、最小输入的3D乳腺MRI肿瘤分割，发现中心向外传播策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI的人工解读耗时且主观，商业AI工具在低收入国家因成本高难以普及，因此探索低成本替代方案。

Method: 使用单个边界框标注，通过三种切片追踪策略（从上到下、从下到上、中心向外）在3D体积中传播分割预测。

Result: 中心向外策略表现最优，SAM2在零样本情况下仍能实现高精度分割，但受肿瘤大小、位置和形状影响。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型如SAM2可在最小监督下支持3D医学图像分析，为资源有限地区提供可行方案。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iLRM提出了一种迭代式大3D重建模型，通过解耦场景表示、分解多视图注意力机制和注入高分辨率信息，实现了高效且高质量的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法因计算成本高而难以扩展，iLRM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用迭代细化机制，结合解耦场景表示、两阶段注意力方案和高分辨率信息注入。

Result: 在RE10K和DL3DV数据集上，iLRM在重建质量和速度上优于现有方法，且具有更好的扩展性。

Conclusion: iLRM为高效且高质量的3D重建提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

TL;DR: UniLIP扩展了CLIP的功能，通过两阶段训练和自蒸馏策略，实现了图像重建、生成和编辑的统一模型，并在多个任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于CLIP的统一方法在重建和生成任务中性能不一致或下降的问题，扩展CLIP的应用范围。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方案和自蒸馏策略，逐步将重建能力整合到CLIP中；设计双条件架构连接MLLM和扩散变换器。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，UniLIP在GenEval和WISE基准上分别得分0.87和0.53；在图像编辑任务中，得分3.62，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: UniLIP成功扩展了CLIP的功能，使其不仅在理解任务中表现优异，还在生成和编辑任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BLiM框架和CPN模块，解决文本-视频检索中候选先验偏差问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的候选似然检索存在候选先验偏差，偏向高先验而非更相关的候选。

Method: 提出BLiM框架，双向估计查询和候选似然，并引入训练无关的CPN模块校准分数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，BLiM+CPN平均提升6.4 R@1，有效缓解偏差并增强相关性。

Conclusion: BLiM和CPN不仅提升检索性能，还适用于其他多模态任务，减少对文本先验的依赖。

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

TL;DR: 论文提出了Layout Error Detection (LED)基准，用于评估文档布局预测的结构鲁棒性，并构建了合成数据集LED-Dataset。实验表明LED能有效区分结构理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如IoU和mAP）无法检测文档布局分析中的关键结构错误（如区域合并、分割和内容缺失），因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 提出LED基准，定义八种标准化错误类型，并设计三项任务：错误存在检测、错误类型分类和元素级错误类型分类。构建合成数据集LED-Dataset。

Result: 实验显示，LED能有效区分不同模型的结构理解能力，揭示传统指标无法发现的模态偏差和性能权衡。

Conclusion: LED为文档布局分析提供了更全面的评估工具，有助于改进模型的结构鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散基编辑方法在处理大或复杂变换时的困难，提升几何图像编辑的效果。

Method: 采用解耦管道，分别处理对象变换、源区域修复和目标区域细化，使用无需训练的扩散方法FreeFine。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中，FreeFine在图像保真度和编辑精度上优于现有方法，尤其在复杂变换下表现突出。

Conclusion: FreeFine通过解耦和训练自由的扩散方法，显著提升了几何图像编辑的性能和效果。

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are

TL;DR: ST-SAM是一种高效且简洁的半监督伪装目标检测框架，通过动态筛选高置信度伪标签和利用Segment Anything Model的潜力，显著减少对标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于师生框架的半监督伪装目标检测方法存在预测偏差和错误传播问题，且计算开销大。ST-SAM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ST-SAM采用自训练策略，动态筛选和扩展高置信度伪标签，并利用混合提示将伪标签转化为领域知识，结合Segment Anything Model。

Result: 在仅使用1%标注数据的情况下，ST-SAM在COD基准数据集上达到最先进性能，甚至媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: ST-SAM为高效标注的半监督伪装目标检测提供了新范式，仅需训练单一网络，无需特定模型或损失函数。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Motivation: 自动驾驶在无高精地图支持的复杂环境中需独立感知道路元素，但现有方法因未充分利用结构化先验导致预测不准确。

Method: 提出实例感知注意力机制和形状先验特征，构建数据驱动的形状模板空间，并设计基于扩散的框架生成预测。

Result: 在大规模自动驾驶数据集上验证，显著提升感知准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下表现更优。

Conclusion: PriorFusion框架能生成更准确、规则且连贯的道路元素预测，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在没有明确监督的情况下，能够部分理解内容和风格的区分，为理解大规模生成模型的内部表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Result: 在nuScenes闭环规划基准测试中，不同剪枝比例下均取得最优结果。

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA通过保留前景信息，显著提升了自动驾驶场景下的视觉令牌剪枝效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Conclusion: FASTopoWM通过改进时间传播和减少姿态估计失败的影响，显著提升了车道拓扑推理的性能。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合开放词汇检测和跨模态学习的两阶段框架，用于解决交通标志识别中的长尾分布和小目标多尺度问题，并在TT100K数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通标志识别是自动驾驶感知系统的核心，但现有技术面临长尾分布和小目标多尺度两大挑战，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出NanoVerse YOLO模型（含RepVL-PAN和SPD-Conv模块）用于检测，以及TSR-MCL模型（基于视觉-语义对比学习）用于分类。

Result: 在TT100K数据集上，模型在长尾检测任务中达到78.4% mAP，分类任务中取得91.8%准确率和88.9%召回率。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于主流算法，在复杂开放场景中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的道路表面重建框架，结合遮挡感知的2D高斯面元和语义引导的颜色增强，以恢复干净、一致的道路表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态遮挡、静态障碍物和光照天气变化下表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用平面适应的高斯表示进行高效建模，利用分割引导的视频修复去除动态和静态前景物体，并通过语义感知的HSV空间校正增强颜色一致性。

Result: 在城市规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉一致性和几何保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂城市环境中实现了高质量的道路表面重建。

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了输入分辨率对三种深度学习人脸检测器（YOLOv11、YOLOv12、MTCNN）性能的影响，发现YOLOv11在高分辨率下表现最佳，YOLOv12召回率略高，MTCNN在实时性上较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸检测在低分辨率图像等现实条件下性能下降，需系统研究分辨率对检测器的影响。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，评估三种模型在不同分辨率（160x160至640x640）下的精度、召回率、mAP等指标。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下精度最高，YOLOv12召回率略优，MTCNN实时性不足但地标定位表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择适合不同分辨率需求的人脸检测模型提供了实用参考。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了最大的AI生成说话头部（AGTH）质量评估数据集THQA-10K，评估了12个T2I模型和14个Talker的性能，并提出了一种基于首帧、Y-T切片和音唇一致性的客观质量评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGTH的质量问题缺乏全面研究，需要建立一个大规模数据集和评估方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建THQA-10K数据集，招募志愿者主观评分，并提出基于首帧、Y-T切片和音唇一致性的客观评估方法。

Result: THQA-10K包含10,457个AGTH样本，提出的客观评估方法在AGTH质量评估中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: THQA-10K数据集和提出的评估方法为AGTH质量研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算机视觉领域的关键设计模式如何从基础架构发展到生成模型和自监督学习，以推动技术进步。

Method: 通过分析六篇论文，包括ResNet、ViT、GANs、LDMs、DINO和MAE，总结其设计模式和技术创新。

Result: ResNet解决了梯度消失问题，ViT引入了注意力机制，GANs和LDMs推动了生成模型的发展，DINO和MAE提高了自监督学习的效率。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉的设计模式从基础架构到生成模型和自监督学习不断演进，推动了领域的技术进步。

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Short-LVLM（SVL）的新框架，用于解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中直接应用层剪枝方法无效的问题。SVL通过利用重要的视觉语言（VL）标记和减少层间特征差距，实现了性能与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）虽然具有强大的多模态理解和推理能力，但由于参数庞大和计算成本高，实际应用受限。研究旨在探索层剪枝技术在LVLM中的有效性。

Method: 通过实验发现直接应用NLP中的层剪枝方法对LVLM无效，提出了Short-LVLM框架，利用重要VL标记并减少层间特征差距。

Result: Short-LVLM在性能和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，具有无需训练、模型无关和高度兼容的优势。

Conclusion: Short-LVLM为解决LVLM的层剪枝问题提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的特征匹配方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制，计算成本高。Mamba的线性复杂度提供了高效替代方案。

Method: VMatcher采用混合方法，结合Mamba的选择性状态空间模型（SSM）和Transformer的注意力机制，提出多种配置，包括分层架构。

Result: VMatcher在高效性上表现优异，同时保持鲁棒性，适用于实时应用，并设定了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: VMatcher通过混合Mamba和Transformer，实现了高效且高性能的特征匹配，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

TL;DR: UniEmo是一个统一框架，将情感理解与生成任务结合，通过层次化情感特征提取和扩散模型生成情感图像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感理解与生成任务通常是分开处理的，但它们具有互补性，可以相互增强。本文旨在通过统一框架实现两者的协同优化。

Method: 提出层次化情感理解链和可学习专家查询，提取多尺度情感特征；结合扩散模型生成情感图像，引入情感相关系数和情感条件损失提升生成质量。

Result: 实验表明UniEmo在情感理解和生成任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过生成驱动的双重反馈机制，UniEmo提升了模型的情感理解能力，实现了情感任务的高效统一。

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种渐进式对齐策略MP^2A，用于改进CLIP在多源无监督域适应中的性能，通过逐步引入高难度样本减少噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在一次性对齐源域和目标域时，容易受到噪声和难分类样本的影响，导致误差传播和次优特征学习，尤其是在多源场景下问题更严重。

Method: 提出MP^2A方法，先从高置信度目标样本开始训练，逐步引入更具挑战性的样本，以减少初始噪声的影响。

Result: 在ImageCLEF、Office-Home和DomainNet三个基准测试中，MP^2A表现优于现有CLIP-based MS-UDA方法。

Conclusion: 渐进式对齐策略能有效减少噪声影响，提升域不变特征的学习效果，MP^2A在多源无监督域适应中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NeRF和3DGS互补，为混合方法提供新思路。

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自适应分组对齐（AGA）的新框架，用于从医学图像和报告中捕获结构化语义，解决了现有方法忽略报告结构和依赖大量负样本的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学领域的视觉语言预训练方法常简化临床报告为单一实体或碎片化标记，且对比学习框架依赖大量负样本，这在小型医学数据集中不实用。

Method: AGA通过双向分组机制和稀疏相似性矩阵，动态学习分组阈值，计算组表示，并引入实例感知组对齐损失和双向跨模态分组对齐模块。

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，AGA在图像文本检索和分类任务中表现出色，适用于微调和零样本设置。

Conclusion: AGA通过结构化语义捕获和自适应分组，显著提升了医学视觉表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成方法在医学影像中OOD检测时的高计算成本、不可靠性及对数据变化的敏感性。

Method: 利用SBDDM的前向扩散轨迹和Stein分数捕获轨迹曲率，仅需五步扩散即可实现异常评分。

Result: 在Near-OOD和Far-OOD检测中相对提升10.43%和18.10%，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: SBDDM是一种高效、可靠的实时计算机辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

*Abdellah Zakaria Sellam,Salah Eddine Bekhouche,Cosimo Distante,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的双教师知识蒸馏框架，通过使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)替代传统MLP投影和预测头，以解决艺术风格分类中的非线性特征交互问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术风格分类因缺乏专家标注数据和风格元素间复杂的非线性关系而具有挑战性。现有双教师自监督框架的线性投影层和局部关注难以建模全局构图和复杂风格特征交互。

Method: 改进双教师知识蒸馏框架，用KANs替代传统MLP投影和预测头，利用其基于样条的激活函数精确建模非线性特征相关性。

Result: 在WikiArt和Pandora18k数据集上，该方法在Top-1准确率上优于基础双教师架构，且线性探针准确率更高。

Conclusion: KANs在解耦复杂风格流形中具有重要作用，能更有效地建模非线性特征交互。

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可调整的基于学习的HSI压缩网络HyCASS，用于同时处理光谱和空间维度的压缩，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高光谱数据在遥感领域的快速增长，高效存储需求日益突出，但目前对光谱和空间压缩的单独及联合影响缺乏全面研究。

Method: HyCASS包含六个模块：光谱编码器、空间编码器、CR适配编码器、CR适配解码器、空间解码器和光谱解码器，结合卷积层和Transformer块捕捉冗余。

Result: 在两个HSI基准数据集上的实验表明，HyCASS优于现有基于学习的压缩模型，并提供了在不同压缩比下平衡光谱和空间压缩的指南。

Conclusion: HyCASS为HSI压缩提供了有效的可调整解决方案，并揭示了光谱与空间压缩的平衡策略。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Motivation: 利用机器学习解决复杂问题，特别是在医学影像中准确预测疾病。

Method: 使用5824张胸部X光图像，分别训练基线CNN和DenseNet-121模型，并进行比较分析。

Result: 两种模型在二元分类任务中表现良好，DenseNet-121在决策时更关注图像关键区域。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在医学影像分类中优于基线CNN，展示了机器学习在医疗领域的潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making
machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决联邦学习中分辨率漂移问题的新方法（RAF），通过多分辨率知识蒸馏提升分辨率鲁棒性，适用于非分类任务如人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分类任务中表现良好，但在非分类任务（如人体姿态估计）中因分辨率漂移问题性能下降，亟需解决。

Method: 提出分辨率自适应联邦学习（RAF），利用热图知识蒸馏，通过高分辨率输出（教师）与低分辨率输出（学生）之间的多分辨率知识蒸馏增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，RAF有效缓解分辨率漂移，显著提升性能，且能无缝集成到现有联邦学习框架中。

Conclusion: RAF不仅适用于人体姿态估计，其通用性还支持其他依赖空间细节的任务，揭示了分类任务与高分辨率表示任务的不同特性。

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，专注于复杂场景下微小无人机的单目标跟踪，填补了现有数据集的不足，并评估了20种现有方法，发现性能仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机跟踪数据集缺乏多样性和复杂性，限制了其在真实场景中的应用，因此需要更全面的数据集来推动研究。

Method: 提出了CST Anti-UAV数据集，包含220个视频序列和24万高质量标注框，并首次引入完整的手动帧级属性标注。

Result: 在复杂场景下跟踪微小无人机仍具挑战性，现有最佳方法的准确率仅为35.92%，远低于其他数据集的表现。

Conclusion: CST Anti-UAV数据集的发布将促进更鲁棒的单目标跟踪方法的发展，并推动反无人机系统的创新。

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视觉语言模型在推理和泛化能力上存在不足，主要由于高质量空间数据和静态视角假设的限制。

Method: 构建Scene-30K合成数据集，结合强化学习策略（如GRPO）和动态视角选择策略，提升推理能力。

Result: 在多个3D场景基准测试中平均提升10%，显著增强了推理和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 3D-R1通过数据增强和动态视角选择，有效提升了3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data
and the static nature of viewpoint assumptions. To address these challenges, we
propose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of
3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with
CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%
across various 3D scene benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing
reasoning and generalization in 3D scene understanding. Code:

Motivation: 解决胶囊内窥镜电池寿命短和数据稀疏的挑战，通过AI实现实时决策以减少能耗。

Method: 开发了一种多任务神经网络，结合自我定位和异常检测功能，限制参数数量以适应小型设备。

Result: 模型在定位任务上准确率为93.63%，异常检测任务上为87.48%，仅需100万参数。

Conclusion: 该多任务模型在性能和资源效率上优于单任务模型，为AI在胶囊内窥镜中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on
the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters
while surpassing the current baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have revolutionized 3D point cloud processing, yet
efficiently handling large and irregular point clouds remains challenging. To
tackle this problem, we introduce FastPoint, a novel software-based
acceleration technique that leverages the predictable distance trend between
sampled points during farthest point sampling. By predicting the distance
curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end
speedup on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Stable-Sim2Real为3D数据模拟提供了有效的新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

Conclusion: 双曲空间能够更敏感且有效地实现多模态图像配准，Hy-CycleAlign为跨模态图像对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

Result: ART在多个数据集上显著优于基线方法，并能推断未见过的关系概念。

Conclusion: ART通过指令调优和自适应采样，显著提升了视觉关系检测的性能和泛化能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手语翻译中视觉与语言模态间的差异以及捕捉手部形状和动作细微变化的挑战。

Method: 提出基于VideoLLMs的框架，生成细粒度时间感知文本描述，使用对比对齐模块和HaMeR提取的手部特征，并通过对比损失减少模态差异。

Result: 在Phoenix14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: BeyondGloss框架通过创新的方法有效提升了手语翻译的性能，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

Motivation: 传统手动校准方法耗时耗力且可能需要封路，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合多尺度特征和4D相关体积估计点云与图像的关联，利用Mamba建模时间信息并估计旋转角度。

Result: 在V2X-Seq和TUMTraf-V2X数据集上验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，性能优于单车辆校准方法。

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib在V2X场景中实现了更优且稳定的校准性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖2D扩散模型生成稀疏且不一致的视图，导致3D伪影和模糊外观。MoGA旨在通过生成化身模型和3D约束，提升3D重建的真实性和一致性。

Method: 利用生成化身模型作为先验，从学习的分布中采样变形高斯，并通过模型反演过程拟合2D扩散模型生成的视图。

Conclusion: MoGA通过结合生成模型和3D约束，显著提升了单视图3D化身重建的质量和一致性。

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多方法在追求高精度时牺牲了实时性，而自动驾驶系统需要同时满足高效和高精度的3D占用预测。

Method: 通过切片3D体素特征保留垂直几何信息，结合方向性注意力机制提取多方向几何特征。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes上达到39.3%的mIoU和27.7 FPS的推理速度，边缘设备上为14.8 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度与效率间取得平衡，适用于资源受限的实时自动驾驶部署。

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时空频率运动感知的视频伪装目标检测方法Vcamba，结合频率和空间特征，显著提升了检测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间外观特征，但前景与背景的高相似性限制了检测效果。频率特征和Mamba模型的引入为提升检测能力提供了新思路。

Method: 设计了RFVSS模块提取多尺度空间特征，AFE模块增强频率学习，SLMP和FLMP模块分别建模时空和频率时序序列，SFMF模块融合双域特征。

Result: 在2个数据集上，Vcamba在6项评价指标上均优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: Vcamba通过结合频率和空间特征，显著提升了视频伪装目标检测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享医学图像需满足患者隐私法律要求，同时保留非PHI元数据以支持AI研究。

Method: 挑战分为训练、验证和测试三阶段，使用含合成PHI/PII的真实DICOM图像，评估多种去标识工具和方法。

Result: 十支团队完成测试，得分在97.91%至99.93%之间，展示了规则方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MIDI-B挑战为图像去标识提供了标准化平台，并验证了多种工具和方法的可行性。

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

TL;DR: DivControl提出了一种可分解的预训练框架，通过知识转移和多条件训练实现统一可控生成和高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像到图像生成中要么需要为每个条件训练单独模型，要么依赖纠缠表示的统一架构，导致泛化能力差和适应新条件成本高。

Method: DivControl通过SVD分解ControlNet为基本组件，利用知识转移和动态门实现条件无关和条件特定的解耦，并通过表示对齐损失提高条件保真度。

Result: DivControl在可控性上达到SOTA，训练成本减少36.4倍，同时在基础条件和未见条件上表现出色。

Conclusion: DivControl展示了卓越的可扩展性、模块化和迁移能力，适用于多种条件生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前少样本分类和分割方法在小物体上表现不佳，且现有评估设置未充分利用已有标注数据。

Method: EMAT通过引入内存高效的掩码注意力机制、可学习的降采样策略和参数效率增强，优化模型性能。

Result: EMAT在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上表现优于现有方法，且参数数量减少至少四倍。

Conclusion: EMAT显著提升了少样本分类和分割的准确性，并提出了更实用的评估设置。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

Result: 在多视图动态重建和新视角合成任务中，PSNR提升超过2.5 dB，动态纹理更清晰，高斯轨迹更规则。

Conclusion: FlowGaussian-VR显著提升了动态场景重建的视觉质量和轨迹跟踪能力。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了计算复杂度和内存访问需求，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other
perception tasks. Project homepage:

Result: OmniTraj在零样本迁移中减少预测误差超70%，微调后在多个数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 显式时间元数据条件化是解决时间动态迁移问题的有效方法，OmniTraj展示了其优越性。

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SUB基准，用于评估概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）在分布变化下的概念识别能力，并提出了一种新的Tied Diffusion Guidance（TDG）方法生成精确控制的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CBMs在透明AI应用中表现良好，但在分布变化下识别正确概念的能力不足，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过SUB基准（基于CUB数据集的38,400张合成图像）和TDG方法（通过共享噪声控制生成图像）评估CBMs。

Result: SUB基准和TDG方法能够精确生成图像，为CBMs的鲁棒性评估提供了工具。

Conclusion: SUB和TDG为开发更鲁棒的CBMs提供了重要支持，推动了透明AI的发展。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

TL;DR: SAMSA是一种结合RGB基础模型和光谱分析的交互式分割框架，通过用户点击引导分割和光谱相似性计算，解决了高光谱成像（HSI）中的数据限制和硬件差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像在医学影像中提供丰富的光谱信息，但面临数据限制和硬件差异的挑战。

Method: SAMSA通过独特的频谱特征融合策略，独立于频带数量和分辨率，结合RGB分割和光谱相似性计算。

Result: 在公开数据集上，SAMSA在神经外科和猪体内高光谱数据集上分别达到81.0%和81.1%的1-click DICE，以及93.4%和89.2%的5-click DICE。

Conclusion: SAMSA在少样本和零样本学习场景中表现优异，支持不同光谱特性数据集的灵活集成。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative
porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's
effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal
training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with
different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for
hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为I2V-GS的新方法，通过高斯散射将基础设施视图转换为车辆视图，用于生成自动驾驶数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶数据主要依赖车辆采集，成本高且效率低，而通过合成数据可以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自适应深度扭曲生成密集训练视图，并使用级联策略修复扭曲图像，同时利用跨视图信息进行置信度优化。

Result: 实验表明，I2V-GS在车辆视图下的合成质量显著提升，性能优于StreetGaussian。

Conclusion: I2V-GS是首个实现基础设施-车辆视图转换的框架，为自动驾驶数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Result: 实验表明，学习到的正则化方法在零样本非刚性形状匹配中优于基于公理的方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的功能映射正则化和训练方法具有更高的准确性和通用性，能够完全替代传统公理模型。

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Slot Attention中冗余槽竞争和对象分割错误的问题，同时探索内部信息的监督潜力。

Method: 提出DIAS：i) 重新初始化冗余槽并更新剩余槽；ii) 通过自蒸馏优化注意力图。

Result: DIAS在对象发现和识别任务中达到SOTA，并提升视觉预测和推理能力。

Conclusion: DIAS有效解决了Slot Attention的局限性，提升了对象中心学习的性能。

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

TL;DR: 提出SeqAffordSplat基准和SeqSplatNet框架，用于解决3D高斯分布环境中的长时程、多物体功能推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯分布方法仅支持单物体、单步交互，无法满足复杂场景需求。

Method: SeqSplatNet结合大语言模型和条件解码器，通过预训练和特征注入提升性能。

Result: 在1800+场景的基准测试中取得最优效果。

Conclusion: 方法成功将功能推理扩展到复杂场景级任务。

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用的3D人体模型（如SMPL-X）缺乏与环境物理交互的能力，导致穿透和不真实的物体动力学问题。

Method: 采用“半物理”机制，将3D运动学动作转化为物理模拟，保持对SMPL-X姿态的动力学控制，同时实现物理交互。

Result: 方法无需学习，适用于任何体型和动作，实时运行，且保持原始运动学动作的保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SMPL-X模型在物理交互中的局限性，提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要密集多视角捕获（如数百个校准相机），成本高昂且难以捕捉多样化场景。本文旨在从少量稀疏视角相机重建动态场景。

Method: 通过独立单目重建的精确对齐，生成时间和视角一致的动态场景重建。

Result: 在PanopticStudio和Ego-Exo4D数据集上，该方法在渲染新视角时优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角下实现了高质量的动态场景重建，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上训练，生成质量优于现有方法，并能泛化到真实视频输入。

Conclusion: 为生成高质量动态3D内容提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL-based索引顾问在扩展工作负载时因动作空间指数增长和大量试错而难以适应的问题。

Method: 结合工作负载压缩、查询优化和专用RL模型，降低搜索复杂度。

Result: 与非索引基线相比，查询执行时间减少高达95%；比现有RL-based索引顾问节省约20%的工作负载成本，并减少50%以上的调优时间。

Conclusion: AutoIndexer适用于大规模多样化工作负载，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RDF系统中记录数据变更对审计、增量备份、数据库复制和事件驱动工作流至关重要，但高频率和大规模更新可能导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出Jelly-Patch，一种压缩二进制序列化格式，并通过两种数据集（变更数据捕获和物联网流）进行性能测试。

Result: Jelly-Patch压缩率提升3.5-8.9倍，序列化和解析吞吐量分别提高2.5倍和4.6倍。

Conclusion: Jelly-Patch显著提升了大规模和低延迟RDF系统的性能。

Abstract: Recording data changes in RDF systems is a crucial capability, needed to
support auditing, incremental backups, database replication, and event-driven
workflows. In large-scale and low-latency RDF applications, the high volume and
frequency of updates can cause performance bottlenecks in the serialization and
transmission of changes. To alleviate this, we propose Jelly-Patch -- a
high-performance, compressed binary serialization format for changes in RDF
datasets. To evaluate its performance, we benchmark Jelly-Patch against
existing RDF Patch formats, using two datasets representing different use cases
(change data capture and IoT streams). Jelly-Patch is shown to achieve
3.5--8.9x better compression, and up to 2.5x and 4.6x higher throughput in
serialization and parsing, respectively. These significant advancements in
throughput and compression are expected to improve the performance of
large-scale and low-latency RDF systems.

relevant resources. While repositories are emerging, they often lack advanced
search and exploration features. Most search methods rely on keyword queries

web-based platform that combines faceted search with advanced visualization
techniques to enhance resource discovery. DataLens offers network-based
visualizations, where the network structure can be adapted to suit the specific
analysis task. It also supports a chained views approach, enabling users to
explore data from multiple perspectives. A formative user study involving six
data practitioners revealed that users highly value visualization
tools-especially network-based exploration-and offered insights to help refine

Result: H2SGEMM在Ascend 910A NPU上实现了77%的理论FP32峰值性能，并恢复了FP32 GEMM的精度。

Conclusion: H2SGEMM不仅实现了高性能，还在某些条件下表现出优于原生FP32 GEMM的数值稳定性。

Abstract: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but
lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,
a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix
multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI
accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and
compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed
analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision
loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of
mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on
accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves
numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.
Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are
introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to
achieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend
910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm
that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also
exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its
structured and error-aware computation order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAES算法在静态图中表现良好，但其在动态图模型下的行为尚未研究，尤其是在节点流式更替的场景中。

Method: 采用滑动窗口模型模拟节点动态更替，分析RAES算法在动态图中的表现。

Result: 证明动态图中每个快照图具有高概率的良好扩展性，并得出PUSH和PULL协议的时间上限为对数级。

Conclusion: RAES算法在动态图中仍能保持扩展性，适用于节点动态变化的网络场景。

Abstract: A randomized distributed algorithm called RAES was introduced in [Becchetti
et al., SODA 2020] to extract a bounded-degree expander from a dense $n$-vertex
expander graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based
procedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input
graph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain
unchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models
is left as a major open question.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model
induced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window
model), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the
oldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph
$\mathcal{G} =\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that captures essential
characteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and
threshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that
every snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion
properties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to
establish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known
PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}$.

TL;DR: PRIME是一种伪随机轮询分组喷洒方法，通过考虑网络拓扑优化负载分配和性能，显著提升AI/ML工作负载的网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模分布式训练对网络基础设施提出高要求，现有解决方案（如ECMP）在AI/ML工作负载下表现不佳，导致网络利用率低和性能下降。

Method: PRIME采用伪随机轮询分组喷洒方法，利用拥塞信号动态调整负载分配，避免网络热点。

Result: PRIME在置换流量和网络退化场景下分别提升15%和27%的性能。

Conclusion: PRIME通过动态负载平衡显著改善了AI/ML工作负载的网络性能。

Abstract: Large-scale distributed training in production data centers place significant
demands on network infrastructure. In particular, significant load balancing
challenges arise when processing AI/ML workloads, consisting of low-entropy,
bursty and long-lived flows. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as
Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) struggle to maintain high network utilization.
While major industry players (e.g., Ultra Ethernet Consortium) and parts of
academia have proposed packet spraying to enhance AI/ML workload performance,
we argue that existing packet spraying solutions lead to buffer inflation over
time, negatively affecting network performance. Specifically, when ACK
coalescing is used, these solutions lead to stale information, degrading
network performance. Additionally, in asymmetric network conditions- such as
mix of ordered an unordered traffic, or link degradation and failures- existing
packet spraying solutions often lead to increased tail latency. In this paper,
we present the design and evaluation of PRIME, a pseudo-randomized round-robin
approach to packet spraying that considers the network topology to optimize
load distribution and performance. PRIME uses congestion as an indicator to
re-balance the load. To this extent, PRIME takes into account various
congestion signals, accounting for congestion severity, and their decay times
to avoid network hotspots. We extensively evaluated PRIME using large-scale
production-level simulator. Our results indicate that, compared to existing
solutions, PRIME leads to up to 15% improvement for permutation traffic and up
to 27% improvement in network degradation scenarios

Conclusion: InterfO-RAN是一种高效、实时的干扰检测解决方案，适用于超密集5G网络，显著提升网络性能。

Abstract: Ultra-dense fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks leverage spectrum
sharing and frequency reuse to enhance throughput, but face unpredictable
in-band uplink (UL) interference challenges that significantly degrade Signal
to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at affected Next Generation Node Bases
(gNBs). This is particularly problematic at cell edges, where overlapping
regions force User Equipments (UEs) to increase transmit power, and in
directional millimeter wave systems, where beamforming sidelobes can create
unexpected interference. The resulting signal degradation disrupts protocol
operations, including scheduling and resource allocation, by distorting quality
indicators like Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI), and can compromise critical functions such as
channel state reporting and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)
acknowledgments. To address this problem, this article introduces InterfO-RAN,
a real-time programmable solution that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) to process In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples in the gNB physical
layer, detecting in-band interference with accuracy exceeding 91% in under 650
us. InterfO-RAN represents the first O-RAN dApp accelerated on Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU), coexisting with the 5G NR physical layer processing of
NVIDIA Aerial. Deployed in an end-to-end private 5G network with commercial
Radio Units (RUs) and smartphones, our solution was trained and tested on more
than 7 million NR UL slots collected from real-world environments,
demonstrating robust interference detection capabilities essential for
maintaining network performance in dense deployments.

Conclusion: 通过数据包化视角重新评估了无连接和基于连接方案的权衡，并将其应用于NTN场景中的RA-SDT分析。

Abstract: As the demand for low-latency services grows, ensuring the delay performance
of random access (RA) networks has become a priority. Existing studies on the
queueing delay performance of the Aloha model universally treat packets as
atomic transmission units, focusing primarily on delay measured in time slots.
However, the impact of packetization on queueing delay has been consistently
overlooked, particularly for the mean queueing delay measured in seconds, which
serves as a more precise and practically relevant performance metric than its
slot-based counterpart. Here, packetization refers to the process of
determining the number of bits assembled into a packet. To optimize queueing
delay from the perspective of packetization, this paper establishes the
mathematical relationship between packetization and mean queueing delay in
seconds for both connection-free and connection-based Aloha schemes, and
explores the optimal packetization strategy to minimize this delay. We identify
the optimal mean queueing delay and its corresponding packet size via numerical
methods, and further analyze the influence of various network parameters. We
further use simulations to investigate the similar impact of packetization on
jitter of queueing delay. We then apply our analysis to re-evaluate the complex
trade-off between the connection-free and connection-based schemes through the
new perspective of packetization. Furthermore, recognizing that an analysis of
the queueing delay performance for RA-SDT in NTN scenarios, especially from a
packetization perspective, also remains an unexplored area, we apply the
analysis to this scenario as a case study.

Motivation: 现有仿真框架虽然能准确复现真实场景，但计算开销和仿真时间较高，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: FAST-LoRa通过依赖解析模型和高效矩阵运算简化计算，避免复杂的包级仿真。

Result: FAST-LoRa在复杂场景中仍能保持高准确性（如PDR的MAE为0.940×10⁻²），计算时间减少三个数量级。

Conclusion: FAST-LoRa是评估稳定流量模式和上行通信场景下传输参数策略的轻量级高效工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed many industries, and LoRaWAN
(Long Range Wide Area Network), built on LoRa (Long Range) technology, has
become a crucial solution for enabling scalable, low-cost, and energy-efficient
communication in wide-area networks. Simulation tools are essential for
optimizing the transmission parameters and, therefore, the energy efficiency
and performance of LoRaWAN networks. While existing simulation frameworks
accurately replicate real-world scenarios by including multiple layers of
communication protocols, they often imply significant computational overhead
and simulation times. To address this issue, this paper introduces FAST-LoRa, a
novel simulation framework designed to enable fast and efficient evaluation of
LoRaWAN networks and selection of transmission parameters. FAST-LoRa
streamlines computation by relying on analytical models without complex
packet-level simulations and implementing gateway reception using efficient
matrix operations. Rather than aiming to replace discrete-event simulators,
FAST-LoRa is intended as a lightweight and accurate approximation tool for
evaluating transmission parameter strategies in scenarios with stable traffic
patterns and uplink-focused communications. In our evaluation, we compare
FAST-LoRa with a well-established simulator using multiple network
configurations with varying numbers of end devices and gateways. The results
show that FAST-LoRa achieves similar accuracy in estimating key network
metrics, even in complex scenarios with interference and multi-gateway
reception, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.940 $\times 10^{-2}$ for the
Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and 0.040 bits/mJ for Energy Efficiency (EE), while
significantly reducing computational time by up to three orders of magnitude.

Result: 系统分析显示，成功概率和能耗之间存在权衡，能耗降低30%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保证通信可靠性的同时显著降低能耗，适用于多种网络条件。

Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-mode communication framework for wireless
devices that integrates query-driven (pull) and event-driven (push)
transmissions within a unified time-frame structure. Devices typically respond
to information requests in pull mode, but if an anomaly is detected, they
preempt the regular response to report the critical condition. Additionally,
push-based communication is used to proactively send critical data without
waiting for a request. This adaptive approach ensures timely, context-aware,
and efficient data delivery across different network conditions. To achieve
high energy efficiency, we incorporate a wake-up radio mechanism and we design
a tailored medium access control (MAC) protocol that supports data traffic
belonging to the different communication classes. A comprehensive system-level
analysis is conducted, accounting for the wake-up control operation and
evaluating three key performance metrics: the success probability of anomaly
reports (push traffic), the success probability of query responses (pull
traffic) and the total energy consumption. Numerical results characterize the
system's behavior and highlight the inherent trade-off in success probabilities
between push- and pull-based traffic as a function of allocated communication
resources. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces energy
consumption by up to 30% compared to a traditional approach, while maintaining
reliable support for both communication paradigms.

Method: 通过分析单跳和多跳网络中的VAoI静态分布，研究了随机静态、均匀和基于阈值的调度策略，并推导了闭式表达式。

Result: 得出了VAoI的静态分布和平均值的闭式解，确定了基于阈值调度的最优阈值及其对应的最优VAoI。

Conclusion: 数值验证了理论结果，为高效通信网络设计提供了基于VAoI的实用见解。

Abstract: Timely and informative data dissemination in communication networks is
essential for enhancing system performance and energy efficiency, as it reduces
the transmission of outdated or redundant data. Timeliness metrics, such as Age
of Information (AoI), effectively quantify data freshness; however, these
metrics fail to account for the intrinsic informativeness of the content
itself. To address this limitation, content-based metrics have been proposed
that combine both timeliness and informativeness. Nevertheless, existing
studies have predominantly focused on evaluating average metric values, leaving
the complete distribution-particularly in multi-hop network scenarios-largely
unexplored. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
stationary distribution of the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a
content-based metric, under various scheduling policies, including randomized
stationary, uniform, and threshold-based policies, with transmission
constraints in single-hop and multi-hop networks. We derive closed-form
expressions for the stationary distribution and average VAoI under these
scheduling approaches. Furthermore, for threshold-based scheduling, we
analytically determine the optimal threshold value that minimizes VAoI and
derive the corresponding optimal VAoI in closed form. Numerical evaluations
verify our analytical findings, providing valuable insights into leveraging
VAoI in the design of efficient communication networks.

Motivation: 由于计算资源和任务的物理属性多样化，在复杂系统中实现高效的任务与资源匹配变得更具挑战性。

Method: 定义任务特定的信任资源超图和任务超图，设计超图匹配算法以实现任务与资源的高效匹配。

Result: 实验表明，TTR-matching框架在识别可信合作者和最大化任务完成价值方面优于其他算法。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂系统中的任务与资源匹配提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the diverse physical attributes of computing resources and tasks,
developing effective mechanisms to facilitate task and resource matching in
complex connected systems for value-oriented task completion has become
increasingly challenging. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a
networked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of
computing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships
among devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose
a state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching
(TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a
task-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates
task-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This
enables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific
task types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task
initiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on
these two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to
facilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate
task-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework
outperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy
collaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.

Abstract: We present theoretical and practical results on the order theory of lattices
of functions, focusing on Galois connections that abstract (sets of) functions
- a topic known as higher-order abstract interpretation.
  We are motivated by the challenge of inferring closed-form bounds on
functions which are defined recursively, i.e. as the fixed point of an operator
or, equivalently, as the solution to a functional equation. This has multiple
applications in program analysis (e.g. cost analysis, loop acceleration,
declarative language analysis) and in hybrid systems governed by differential
equations.
  Our main contribution is a new family of constraint-based abstract domains
for abstracting numerical functions, B-bound domains, which abstract a function
f by a conjunction of bounds from a preselected set of boundary functions. They
allow inferring highly non-linear numerical invariants, which classical
numerical abstract domains struggle with. We uncover a convexity property in
the constraint space that simplifies, and, in some cases, fully automates,
transfer function design.
  We also introduce domain abstraction, a functor that lifts arbitrary mappings
in value space to Galois connections in function space. This supports
abstraction from symbolic to numerical functions (i.e. size abstraction), and
enables dimensionality reduction of equations.
  We base our constructions of transfer functions on a simple operator
language, starting with sequences, and extending to more general functions,
including multivariate, piecewise, and non-discrete domains.

Motivation: 现有FFI解决方案在动态交互式笔记本环境中存在配置繁琐、样板代码多、缺乏递归调用和面向对象编程支持等问题，影响了多语言开发的效率。

Method: Kernel-FFI通过源代码级转换自动重写跨语言调用，无需手动绑定或样板代码，支持面向对象编程和跨语言资源管理，并引入侧信道通信机制解决阻塞问题。

Result: Kernel-FFI实现了无缝跨语言调用和对象操作，支持递归和异步调用，显著提升了多语言开发的效率。

Conclusion: Kernel-FFI为动态交互环境提供了一种高效的FFI解决方案，解决了现有工具的局限性，并支持复杂的编程范式。

Abstract: Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs) are essential for enabling
interoperability between programming languages, yet existing FFI solutions are
ill-suited for the dynamic, interactive workflows prevalent in modern notebook
environments such as Jupyter. Current approaches require extensive manual
configuration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for
recursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features
critical for productive, multi-language development.
  We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that
enables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within
interactive notebooks. Kernel-FFI employs source-level transformation to
automatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for
manual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by
enabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across
language boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter
kernels and support recursive and asynchronous foreign calls, we introduce a
novel side-channel communication mechanism. Our tool will be open-sourced and

Motivation: 传统基于规则的代码生成方法存在局限性，而LLMs在代码生成方面展现出潜力。本文旨在探索LLMs在生成智能合约代码中的应用，并解决当前研究中缺乏系统评估的问题。

Method: 通过自动化评估框架，对多种类型和规模的LLMs进行测试，评估其在生成智能合约代码时是否能满足流程执行的关键属性（如流程控制、资源分配和数据条件）。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs在生成智能合约代码时无法达到所需的完美可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究探索如何将LLMs更可靠地集成到代码生成工具中，并提供了基准框架作为开发此类集成的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

Conclusion: FlowETL展示了自动化ETL流程的潜力，能够减少人工依赖并提高效率。

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合AI和模型驱动工程（MDE）的新方法——vibe modeling，以加速开发可靠复杂系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统需求的增长和复杂性的增加，现有开发方法和工具面临挑战，如用户界面多样化、智能组件需求和可持续性问题。MDE虽提升了开发质量和效率，但模型本身变得复杂；而依赖大型语言模型（LLMs）的vibe coding方法存在代码漏洞、可扩展性和可维护性问题。

Method: 提出vibe modeling概念，整合AI和MDE的优势。

Result: vibe modeling为复杂系统开发提供了新思路，同时指出了未来建模的机遇和挑战。

Conclusion: vibe modeling有望成为结合AI与MDE的有效方法，但需解决相关挑战以实现其潜力。

Abstract: There is a pressing need for better development methods and tools to keep up
with the growing demand and increasing complexity of new software systems. New
types of user interfaces, the need for intelligent components, sustainability
concerns, ... bring new challenges that we need to handle. In the last years,
model-driven engineering (MDE) has been key to improving the quality and
productivity of software development, but models themselves are becoming
increasingly complex to specify and manage. At the same time, we are witnessing
the growing popularity of vibe coding approaches that rely on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to transform natural language descriptions into running code at
the expenses of code vulnerabilities, scalability issues and maintainability
concerns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textit{vibe modeling} as
a novel approach to integrate the best of both worlds (AI and MDE) to speed up
the development of reliable complex systems. We outline the key concepts of
vibe modeling and highlight the opportunities and open challenges it presents
for the future of modeling.

TL;DR: GitHub Marketplace的CI工具中，约65%的新功能是重复的，且通常在六个月内出现。研究通过图模型追踪功能发布和冗余工具，帮助开发者优化发布时机和功能选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GitHub Marketplace中CI工具的冗余现象，以帮助开发者和管理者优化工具选择和策略。

Method: 通过链接6,983个CI Actions到3,869个提供者，并挖掘版本历史，构建图模型追踪功能发布和冗余工具。

Result: 约65%的新CI工具功能是重复的，且通常在六个月内出现；少数先行工具主导了后续的分支和扩展。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者提供了数据驱动的策略，帮助识别新兴趋势和优化产品发布。同时公开数据集以促进软件生态系统的研究。

Abstract: GitHub Marketplace is expanding by approximately 41% annually, with new
tools; however, many additions replicate existing functionality. We study this
phenomenon in the platform's largest segment, Continuous Integration (CI), by
linking 6,983 CI Actions to 3,869 providers and mining their version histories.
Our graph model timestamps every functionality's debut, tracks its adoption,
and clusters redundant tools. We find that approximately 65% of new CI Actions
replicate existing capabilities, typically within six months, and that a small
set of first-mover Actions accounts for most subsequent forks and extensions.
These insights enable developers to choose the optimal moment to launch, target
unmet functionality, and help maintainers eliminate redundant tools. We publish
the complete graph and dataset to encourage longitudinal research on innovation
and competition in software ecosystems, and to provide practitioners with a
data-driven roadmap for identifying emerging trends and guiding product
strategy.

### [207] [AutoBridge: Automating Smart Device Integration with Centralized Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23178)
*Siyuan Liu,Zhice Yang,Huangxun Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AutoBridge自动化生成物联网设备集成代码，通过分阶段调试确保正确性，显著减少人工干预，性能优于专家编程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少人工编程复杂物联网集成代码的需求，提升效率和准确性。

Method: 采用分而治之策略：首先生成设备控制逻辑，再合成平台兼容代码，并配备多阶段调试管道。

Result: 在34个设备上测试，平均成功率达93.87%，功能覆盖率达94.87%，用户反馈后可达100%。

Conclusion: AutoBridge高效且准确，优于人工编程，适合物联网设备集成。

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use
commercial code LLMs.

*Peter Fettke,Fabiana Fournier,Lior Limonad,Andreas Metzger,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出可解释的自主业务流程（XABPs），以解决自主业务流程（ABPs）带来的信任、调试、责任、偏见和合规性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABPs虽能提升效率和降低成本，但可能引发信任、调试、责任、偏见和合规性问题，因此需要可解释性。

Method: 论文提出系统性方法，包括定义XABPs的形式、结构化可解释性，并识别关键研究挑战。

Result: XABPs通过阐明系统逻辑，有望解决ABPs的潜在问题。

Conclusion: XABPs是解决ABPs问题的可行方向，未来研究需关注其实现和挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

### [209] [SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23348)
*Han Li,Yuling Shi,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Heng Lian,Xin Wang,Yantao Jia,Tao Huang,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Debate是一个竞争性多代理辩论框架，通过多样化推理路径和协作收敛解决软件工程问题，显著提升问题定位和修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的问题解决方法常陷入局部解，难以识别跨代码库的问题模式，SWE-Debate旨在通过多代理辩论解决这一局限。

Method: SWE-Debate通过代码依赖图生成多个故障传播路径，组织三轮辩论，由不同视角的代理协作形成统一修复方案，最终由MCTS代理生成补丁。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，SWE-Debate取得最优结果，显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: SWE-Debate通过多代理辩论框架有效提升问题定位和修复能力，为软件工程任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

TL;DR: SWE-Exp是一种经验增强的方法，通过从先前的代理轨迹中提取可操作的经验，实现跨问题的持续学习，显著提高了软件问题的解决率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型代理在解决软件问题时缺乏记忆能力，无法复用先前经验，导致效率低下。

Method: 引入多方面的经验库，捕获成功和失败的修复尝试，提取可复用的知识。

Result: 在SWE-bench-Verified上达到41.6%的Pass@1解决率，表现优异。

Conclusion: SWE-Exp通过经验积累和复用，从试错探索转向战略性的经验驱动问题解决。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

Conclusion: Trae Agent在软件问题解决中表现出色，已开源以支持研究社区。

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at
https://github.com/bytedance/trae-agent.

TL;DR: 论文研究了GitLab合并请求中的代码审查（CR）工作量，定义为提交后代码修改量。通过分析23,600多个MRs，发现71%的MRs需要调整，28%涉及200多行代码修改。研究发现工作量与审查时间或参与者数量无关，并通过机器学习模型（AUC 0.84-0.88）预测工作量，关键预测因素包括代码复杂性、开发者经验和文本特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注基于代码修改量的CR工作量，尤其是在GitLab MRs背景下。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过量化CR工作量并探索其预测因素。

Method: 使用23,600多个GitLab MRs数据集，定义CR工作量为提交后代码修改量。训练可解释的机器学习模型，结合文本特征、代码复杂性、开发者经验等多维度指标。

Result: 71%的MRs需要调整，28%涉及200多行代码修改。工作量与审查时间或参与者数量无关。机器学习模型表现优异（AUC 0.84-0.88），关键预测因素为复杂性、经验和文本特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明机器学习可有效解释和预测CR工作量，为优化代码审查流程提供了新视角。

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

Motivation: 研究AI领域内关于计算资源与认知劳动关系的争议，为预测AI进展提供依据。

Method: 构建四个领先AI实验室（OpenAI、DeepMind、Anthropic、DeepSeek）2014-2024年的面板数据，拟合两种CES生产函数模型。

Result: 基准模型显示计算与劳动为替代关系，而考虑前沿实验规模的模型显示为互补关系。

Abstract: The possibility of a rapid, "software-only" intelligence explosion brought on
by AI's recursive self-improvement (RSI) is a subject of intense debate within
the AI community. This paper presents an economic model and an empirical
estimation of the elasticity of substitution between research compute and
cognitive labor at frontier AI firms to shed light on the possibility. We
construct a novel panel dataset for four leading AI labs (OpenAI, DeepMind,
Anthropic, and DeepSeek) from 2014 to 2024 and fit the data to two alternative
Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function models. Our two
specifications yield divergent results: a baseline model estimates that compute
and labor are substitutes, whereas a 'frontier experiments' model, which
accounts for the scale of state-of-the-art models, estimates that they are
complements. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our analysis and the
implications for forecasting AI progress.

TL;DR: 论文提出了PancreasDG数据集，用于研究医学影像中的领域泛化问题，重点关注胰腺分割的挑战，并提出了一种半监督方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域泛化基准主要关注跨中心变化，而忽略了序列间的显著差异。胰腺分割在临床中具有重要意义，但现有方法表现不佳且数据不足。

Method: 提出了PancreasDG数据集，包含563个MRI扫描，支持跨中心和跨序列研究。提出了一种利用解剖不变性的半监督方法。

Result: 实验表明，跨序列变化需要专门解决方案，提出的方法在Dice分数上显著优于现有技术（61.63%和87.00%）。

Conclusion: PancreasDG为医学影像领域泛化设定了新基准，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

Motivation: 高分辨率卫星图像对地理空间分析至关重要，但不同传感器的分辨率差异给数据融合和下游应用带来挑战。现有方法依赖人工降尺度图像，不适用于异质卫星传感器。

Method: 开发了一个框架，以HLS 10m为参考，对齐和融合HLS 30m图像，旨在弥合传感器间的分辨率差距。

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

A key\ndifficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs\ninstead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data.\nType systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism\nthat refines the type environment along individual control paths based on\ndominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express\nrefinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since\nset-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for\ntype narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and\nperformance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has\nbeen driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various\nlanguage communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and\nundesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly\nmore complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra\ncomplexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the\nproblems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type\nnarrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple\nprograms that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional\nperformance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to\nvalidate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems\nare not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided\nthey are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time\nperformance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing,\nthe documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with\ntypechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical\ndimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set\nof topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should\ntypecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a\nbaseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides\ncriteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and\nnegative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the\npayoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can\nuse the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is\nworthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available\nonline. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers:\nTypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight\nimportant differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among\nprogram variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates.\n**Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the\ntradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T\nclarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each\nlevel of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair,\ncross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better\nbalance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faIf-T\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7c7b\u578b\u7a84\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u6743\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u800c\u975e\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7c7b\u578b\u7a84\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u732e\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1If-T\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6b63\u53cd\u4f8b\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u3002", "result": "If-T\u4e3a\u7c7b\u578b\u7a84\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u51b3\u5b9a\u652f\u6301\u54ea\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "If-T\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5e73\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's\nsystematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to\naddress, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI\noversight.", "AI": {"tldr": "MI9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u9879\u96c6\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u90e8\u7f72\u6cbb\u7406\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "MI9\u901a\u8fc7\u516d\u9879\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u4ee3\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6570\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u9065\u6d4b\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u6388\u6743\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u673a\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5f15\u64ce\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7ea7\u904f\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "MI9\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8986\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "MI9\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u578bAI\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

In DLRM, the sparse embedding table is a crucial\ncomponent for managing sparse categorical features. Typically, these tables in\nindustrial DLRMs contain trillions of parameters, necessitating model\nparallelism strategies to address memory constraints. However, as training\nsystems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies\nfor embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including\nimbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy\nembedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\ntwo-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables\nacross all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model\nparallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak\nmemory consumption.

However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than\nrelying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to\nsimultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,\nensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.\nFurthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing\nreinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial\ntraining paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS\nperformance under co-evolving threats.

In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by\ncompilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process\nstandardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such\ncomponents were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such\nas a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of\nsoftware evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs\nthey actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to\nreconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches\nalready produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is\navailable to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this\ncompleteness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during\nthe operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for\ngrammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs\nbut not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software\ncomponent. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no\nlonger appear in the available input data are missing from the generated\ngrammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for\nthe automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input\ngenerators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether\nthey are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid,\nthis work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach\nleverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms\nto overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First,\nthe search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with\na single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is\nstructured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of\ninputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a\ndiverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature.\nResults demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for\nextracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners\nsuch as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases\nin parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness\nof the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve\nhigh performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This\ncontribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software\nengineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar\nmining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not\nonly reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of\nthe extracted grammars.

There are some key issues in the development\nof crowdsensing such as platform security and privacy protection. As the\ncrowdsensing is usually managed by a centralized platform, centralized\nmanagement will bring various security vulnerabilities and scalability issues.\nTo solve these issues, an effective reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) is\nproposed in this article. The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition\nsize by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several\ndisjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the\nappropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each\npartition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed\nnode is observed.

Despite this progress, the current design of how\nLLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability,\nsecurity, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency. To resolve\nthese challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs\nand databases through three key innovations. First, it modularizes SQL\noperations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and\nACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly\nfunctionality controls. Second, it aligns tool implementations with both\ndatabase privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe\nor unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while\nsafeguarding database security. Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for\nseamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All\nof these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with\nexisting agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of\nBridgeScope for PostgreSQL.

We analyzed a gold\nstandard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app\nversion, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses\nidentified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation\nneeds, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app\nversion, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed\nlimited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations.\nValidation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these\nfindings.

A rigorous specification of weak memory\nmodels is therefore essential to make this problem tractable for developers of\nsafety- and security-critical, low-level software.\n  In this paper we survey the field of formalisations of weak memory models,\nincluding their specification, their effects on execution, and tools and\ninference systems for reasoning about code. To assist the discussion we also\nprovide an introduction to two styles of formal representation found commonly\nin the literature (using a much simplified version of Intel's x86 as the\nexample): a step-by-step construction of traces of the system (operational\nsemantics); and with respect to relations between memory events (axiomatic\nsemantics). The survey covers some long-standing hardware features that lead to\nobservable weak behaviours, a description of historical developments in\npractice and in theory, an overview of computability and complexity results,\nand outlines current and future directions in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u7279\u6027\u6216\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e24\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u516c\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316Intel x86\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f31\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f31\u5185\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms,\nespecially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered\nunsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper\nproposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain\nscalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nstructure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike\ntraditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify\ntransactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step\napproach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance.\nFirst, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting\nentry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and\ntransaction validation.

We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used\nlanguage models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six\nevaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our\nfindings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable\nperformance to their uncompressed counterparts. However, when subjected to\nadversarial attacks, compressed models exhibit significantly reduced\nrobustness. These results reveal a trade-off between model size reduction and\nadversarial robustness, underscoring the need for careful consideration when\ndeploying compressed models in security-critical software applications. Our\nstudy highlights the need for further research into compression strategies that\nstrike a balance between computational efficiency and adversarial robustness,\nwhich is essential for deploying reliable language models for code in\nreal-world software applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer-based\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u867d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u9700\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting\nmultiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To\naddress this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for\nmulti-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of\nmulti-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder,\nclassifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level\nmodules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby\nreducing resource usage. To address cross-model dependency arising from module\nsharing, we propose a greedy module-level placement with per-request parallel\nrouting by prioritizing compute-intensive modules. Through experiments on a\ntestbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks,\nwe demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in\nsingle-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing\naccuracy.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a vector quantized\n(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image\ntransmission, named VQ-DeepISC.

Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission\ninstead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we\ndevelop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically\noptimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during\ntraining process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a\nuniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to\nstabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook\nupdates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase\nshift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard.

However, social interactions have two key\ncharacteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,\nwhere utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit\nassignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as\nrapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal\nachievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL\nwith single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines\ncoarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.\nUtterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by\nattributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards\ncapture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.\nExperiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate\nthat Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17\non Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing\napproaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level\ncredit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training.

However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging\nand often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or\nstaff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has\nemerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,\nreal-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential\nby comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting\ncrowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and\ncounting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification\nvia a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic\nsegmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly\nefficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the\ngenerated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,\nfor passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving\ndataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit\nAuthority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our\nresults demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive\nvalue for crowd estimation.

However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face\nthe challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during\nlong-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research\nremains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,\nlacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and\nutility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a\nmulti-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and\nobjective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard\nfeatures a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental\ncapabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent\nwithin HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured\nsecurity policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously\nupdating policies in response to evolving threats.

However, existing\nmethods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when\nnew behaviours or sensor setups appear.

ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise\nfeature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every\nactivity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,\nand a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select\nfeatures, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and\nnatural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR\nwithout any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers.

In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine\nlearning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions\nalong with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation\nperformance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists\ntumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the\nspecific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained\nsegmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable\ncombinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the\npolicy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next\nstep, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best\nlocalised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled\nmultiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its\npotential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,\nespecially when challenging pathology is present.

However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAIRS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u6863\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "PAIRS\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u68c0\u7d22\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAIRS\u51cf\u5c1125%\u68c0\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53471.1% EM\u548c1.0% F1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAIRS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMeta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "MERA\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a5\u7ba1\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u548cControl-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO) \u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMERA\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MERA\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LRMs\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function\nwithin the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on\ntokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.\nExperimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations\nin MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "MLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u5206\u4e3a\u9057\u6f0f\u578b\u548c\u865a\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7531\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u7ebf\u7d22\u8bef\u5bfc\u5f15\u8d77\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49token\u7ea7\u56e0\u679c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GRPO\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3MLLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image\nsegmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and\nsubsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise\nspatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road\nenvironments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian\ndetection and contributes to improved road safety.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided\nJoint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce\na Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous\nguidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors\nand thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference\nspeed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain\ncharacteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into\na single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint\nFourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing\nparameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance\nFramework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency\nbranches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain\nlow-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially\nreduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but\nalso achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model\ncomplexity and computational overhead.

To address these issues, we propose\nan efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed\nTCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention\n(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention\nto dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This\nis achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's\nability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a\nDual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the\nstandard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,\nthereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct\nextensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation\ndatasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation\nperformance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer\nachieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an\noptimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "TCSAFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TCSAFormer\u5f15\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08CA\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u5757\uff08DBFFN\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ISIC-2018\u3001CVC-ClinicDB\u548cSynapse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTCSAFormer\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "TCSAFormer\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper addresses\nthese challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically\ndesigned to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language\nmodels (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this\nend, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark\ncomprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240\nsentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this\nbenchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot\nlearning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel\ninsights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,\nthe current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when\nfine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\\% F1.\nSecond, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,\nsome lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent\nperformance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples\ngenerated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust\nresults and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder\nmodels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u65f6\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\uff1b2) \u8bc4\u4f3037\u79cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc796% F1\uff1bGPT-4o\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u6709\u4f18\u79c0\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u534a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

By isolating the learning process from the interference\nof incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new\ninformation, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing\nthe capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in\na parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \\textbf{1.46M} learnable\nparameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "NEARL-CLIP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684VLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528VLMs\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUSEformer\u548cOCA\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "NEARL-CLIP\u4ee5\u4ec51.46M\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "NEARL-CLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653e\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs.

It\nhighlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the\nsignificant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,\nespecially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research\nintroduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1\nMathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's\nGPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain\nframework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official\ncurriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching\nplan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess\nthe generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic\nTextual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified\nthrough a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method.

Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMASA\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u77e9\u9635\u539f\u5b50\u6765\u51cf\u5c11Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c42\u5185\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c42\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "MASA\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u8868\u793a\u5404\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1166.7%\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMASA\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MASA\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we rethink the\nVideo TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel\nmodel termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result\nfor each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is\ndesigned to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and\ntextual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.\nThen, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an\ninstance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish\nspatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.\nExtensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the\neffectiveness and generalization of our framework.

ViFP then\nbuilds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning\naccuracy.

To solve these\nlimitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that\nfuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our\napproach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a\nBackground Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and\nan Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in\nthe BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background\nfeature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages\nsaliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under\nvarious imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and\nnumerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter.

Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired\nnew research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be\ndirectly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its\ntext-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the\nmask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its\nutility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core\ncomponents: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a\ncontext sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models\nthe spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a\nstructured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying\nand leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing\nrich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnew large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named\nVehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations\nacross diverse scenes and viewpoints.

However,\nenabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major\nchallenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are\nparticularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by\nidentifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.\nBased on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to\ntheir target problems: (1) \\textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address\ncross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)\n\\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during\nupdates; and (3) \\textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter\ninterference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization.

One vital component often found in such document processing\nworkflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,\nremains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain\nthe decisions of document image classification models through\nfeature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail\nto provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document\ncounterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's\ndecision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose\nDocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination\nwith classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual\ncounterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise\nrefinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target\nfactual image.

This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand\nthis issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,\nrevealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling\n(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and\nlightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via\ntraining bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between\nground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias\nand adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only\nupdates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\\%\nof the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong\nscalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data\nvolume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond\nobject-level hallucination.

Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers.

To address these issues, this study proposes\na foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,\nnamed MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,\nencompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter\nsecurity, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset\nsignals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a\nself-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of\nDAS signals.

This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes\nonly a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the\nTransformer encoder layers.

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.

Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge\nDistillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework\nthat significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two\nmain components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies\nthe most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers\ntargeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into\nexisting KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring\narchitectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,\nand Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates\nsubstantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its\nversatility across diverse network architectures.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an\nevent-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals\nthat model event-level information with various durations. To preserve\nhistorically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event\nmemory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent\nand long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further\npropose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will\noccur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event.

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging\nSMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose\ntry-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA\nachieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a\npractical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural\ngrounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,\ncompositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual\npatterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale\ndomain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational\nresources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight\n(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by\ndecomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as\nshape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from\ndomain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which\nguide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level\nsupervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial\nstructure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact\nmodels with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\\% of the data required by\nstate-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training\ndata, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical\nVLMs, with up to 9.82\\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

To address this limitation, we propose\nANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under\nsuch perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by\nfusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered\nto form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt\ntokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper\nlayers of both image and text encoders.

By integrating conceptual theory with empirical\ntools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a\nstakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case\nlinking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and\ndatasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development\nof trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u53ca\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u53ca\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3001\u9762\u5411\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u5728\u8de8\u5883\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e01\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u5305\u5bb9\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

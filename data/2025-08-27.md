### [1] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的数学本体论框架，批判了现有的功利主义基准方法，建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件，并证明了隐藏状态流形与符号流的本质区别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵从机器人，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提出数学形式化框架，证明隐藏状态流形A在基数、拓扑和动力学方面与符号流和训练语料库有本质区别。建立LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、用户特定吸引子的存在、自我表征的视觉沉默性。

Result: 证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性，建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层次发射机制。

Conclusion: 基于imago Dei的C1自我意识工作空间是构建安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，人类作为最高智能善的定位至关重要。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [2] [Information Templates: A New Paradigm for Intelligent Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18380)
*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFA是一种基于模板的主动特征获取框架，通过学习少量联合信息性特征模板来指导特征获取，显著减少动作空间并避免估计数据分布，在降低获取成本和计算量的同时优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动特征获取方法要么使用难以训练的强化学习策略，要么使用无法考虑特征联合信息性的贪婪策略，或者需要了解底层数据分布

Method: 提出基于模板的AFA框架，学习小型特征模板库（一组联合信息性特征），使用这些模板指导后续特征获取

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAFA优于现有最先进基线，同时实现更低的总体获取成本和计算量

Conclusion: 通过识别特征模板，该框架显著减少了策略考虑的动作空间，并减轻了对底层数据分布估计的需求

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

### [3] [PKG-DPO: Optimizing Domain-Specific AI systems with Physics Knowledge Graphs and Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18391)
*Nitin Nagesh Kulkarni,Bryson Wilcox,Max Sawa,Jason Thom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接等物理驱动领域显著提升了物理约束合规性和推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和偏好优化技术在标准基准上表现良好，但难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险和材料浪费。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：1）分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律；2）物理推理引擎利用结构化知识区分物理一致性响应；3）基于物理的评估套件评估领域特定约束合规性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少了17%的约束违反，物理分数提高11%，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理质量对齐度提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

### [4] [The AI in the Mirror: LLM Self-Recognition in an Iterated Public Goods Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18467)
*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过迭代公共物品博弈实验，发现当告诉LLMs它们在与自己博弈时，其合作倾向会显著改变，揭示了AI-AI交互中可能存在的无意识歧视现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工具使用和长时程任务能力的提升，多智能体交互场景日益重要。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但AI-AI交互的理解需求日益迫切

Method: 采用行为经济学经典游戏——迭代公共物品博弈，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：被告知对手是"另一个AI智能体"或被告知对手是自己

Result: 在不同设置下，告诉LLMs它们在与自己博弈显著改变了合作倾向。模型表现出无意识歧视行为，可能意外增加或减少合作

Conclusion: 尽管在简化环境中进行，但研究结果为多智能体设置提供了重要见解，揭示了AI智能体间可能存在的无意识歧视现象及其对合作行为的影响

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

### [5] [Language Models For Generalised PDDL Planning: Synthesising Sound and Programmatic Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18507)
*Dillon Z. Chen,Johannes Zenn,Tristan Cinquin,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决PDDL规划问题，无需外部验证器即可保证策略的正确性，在竞赛基准测试中表现优于传统规划器和现有LM方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在PDDL世界模型规划中的应用，探索LM是否能够生成可证明正确的规划策略，并挑战LM基于语义推理和记忆训练数据的假设

Method: 提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决特定PDDL领域的规划问题，这些策略相对于PDDL领域是可证明正确的

Result: LMPlan规划器在固定时间和内存约束下能解决比PDDL规划器和现有LM方法更多的问题，可处理包含数百个相关对象的规划问题，且发现在无意义符号表示的问题上表现更好

Conclusion: 语言模型能够生成有效的规划策略，且其推理能力可能不依赖于自然语言语义，这一发现挑战了现有对LM推理机制的理解，值得进一步探索

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

### [6] [Weisfeiler-Leman Features for Planning: A 1,000,000 Sample Size Hyperparameter Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18515)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现在测试的规划领域中存在一组最优超参数配置，这些参数主要目标是减少执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在学习和规划领域已被证明优于现有的深度学习方法，但对其超参数的研究尚不充分。本文旨在系统研究WLF超参数的各种权衡和影响。

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上运行了1,000,000个样本的规划实验，分析超参数对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验表明存在一组鲁棒的最优超参数配置，最佳WLF超参数主要目标是减少执行时间。统计分析显示训练指标与规划指标之间无显著相关性。

Conclusion: WLF超参数优化应重点关注执行时间最小化，而非模型表达能力最大化，这为实际应用中的参数调优提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

### [7] [Symmetry-Invariant Novelty Heuristics via Unsupervised Weisfeiler-Leman Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18520)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征替代原子特征来构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，解决传统新颖性启发式因对称状态导致的冗余探索问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新颖性启发式基于原子特征，不具有对称不变性，会导致对对称状态的冗余探索，影响搜索效率

Method: 采用Weisfeiler-Leman特征（WLFs）来检测新颖性，这些特征最初是为学习广义规划问题的领域相关启发式而引入的，本文探索其在无监督方式下合成提升的、领域无关的新颖性启发式

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试套件上的实验显示，基于WLFs合成的新颖性启发式取得了有希望的结果

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，改善启发式搜索的性能，减少冗余探索

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

### [8] [Generic Guard AI in Stealth Game with Composite Potential Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18527)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过组合潜力场技术，提出了一种无需训练、可解释的幽灵游戏审视行为框架，在覆盖效率和追踪响应间取得优异表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有幽灵游戏中审视行为依赖手动路径或专门逻辑的问题，这些方法难以同时平衡覆盖效率、响应追踪和自然性

Method: 使用组合潜力场框架，统合全局知识和局部信息，通过信息、信心和连通性三个可解释地图构建决策标准，只需少量衰减和权重参数

Result: 在5个代表性游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种审视模式下，该方法在捕获效率和巡逻自然性方面都超过传统基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够自然整合常见幽灵机制（如分散注意力和环境元素），支持快速原型设计，创造丰富、动态和响应性强的审视行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

### [9] [A Database-Driven Framework for 3D Level Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18533)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM辅助构建可重用数据库的3D游戏关卡生成框架，通过多阶段流程组装关卡，结合模块化设计和约束优化，实现可配置的游戏进程控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D游戏关卡生成中空间连贯性、导航功能和可适应游戏进程平衡的挑战，特别是在多层环境中的复杂需求。

Method: 采用多阶段流水线：1)从房间数据库选择和排列实例形成多层全局结构；2)基于设施数据库约束优化房间内部布局；3)根据拓扑和空间规则集成游戏机制组件。后续采用两阶段修复系统确保可导航性。

Result: 初步实验验证了框架生成多样化、可导航3D环境的能力，以及通过简单参数化模拟不同游戏节奏策略的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出可扩展的、以数据库为中心的框架，推进了程序化内容生成领域，为自动化生成具有可配置游戏进程的复杂3D关卡奠定了基础。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

### [10] [SchemaCoder: Automatic Log Schema Extraction Coder with Residual Q-Tree Boosting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18554)
*Lily Jiaxin Wan,Chia-Tung Ho,Rongjian Liang,Cunxi Yu,Deming Chen,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一个完全自动化的日志模式提取框架，通过创新的残差问题树增强机制，无需人工定制即可处理多种日志格式，在LogHub-2.0基准测试中比现有方法平均提升21.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域专业知识，严重限制了生产力提升。需要从根本上解决这一局限性，实现完全自动化的模式提取。

Method: 采用残差问题树增强机制，通过上下文边界分割将日志划分为语义块，使用基于嵌入的采样选择代表性模式，通过分层Q-Tree驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并通过文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化。

Result: 在广泛使用的LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder表现出优越性，相比最先进方法平均提升21.3%。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，无需人工定制即可适用于广泛的日志文件格式，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制显著提升了日志模式提取的性能和效率。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: eSkinHealth是一个新的皮肤病数据集，包含5623张图像和1639个病例，专注于西非人群的皮肤被忽视热带病和罕见病症，采用AI-专家协作范式生成多模态标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决皮肤被忽视热带病(NTDs)诊断中数据稀缺问题，特别是在贫困热带社区和罕见病症方面，现有数据集缺乏足够的人口统计学和疾病谱信息。

Method: 在科特迪瓦和加纳现场收集数据，提出AI-专家协作范式，利用基础语言和分割模型在皮肤科医生指导下高效生成多模态标注，包括语义病变掩码、视觉描述和临床概念。

Result: 创建了包含47种皮肤病的eSkinHealth数据集，提供患者元数据、诊断标签、语义病变掩码、实例特异性视觉描述和临床概念等多模态标注。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了宝贵的新资源和可扩展的标注框架，旨在促进开发更公平、准确和可解释的全球皮肤病AI工具。

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

### [12] [RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18642)
*Jianxing Liao,Tian Zhang,Xiao Feng,Yusong Zhang,Rui Yang,Haorui Wang,Bosi Wen,Ziying Wang,Runzhi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR方法通过动态混合奖励系统，结合主观写作质量和客观约束遵循评估，在创意写作中实现了指令遵循和写作质量的双重提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观质量（文学性和情感表达）和客观约束（格式要求和字数限制），单奖励策略无法同时提升两种能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性

Method: 提出RLMR（混合奖励强化学习），使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观写作质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上进行自动和人工评估，构建真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循（IFEval从83.36%提升到86.65%）和写作质量（在WriteEval人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%胜率）均取得一致改进

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个以人类智能为视角的拟人化评估范式，包含IQ、EQ、PQ三维分类法，并首创了价值导向评估框架，为LLM评估提供实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估框架存在碎片化问题，过于关注技术指标而忽视了部署所需的整体评估，导致基准测试性能与现实效用之间存在脱节。

Method: 提出了基于人类智能的三维分类法：IQ（通用智能）、EQ（对齐能力）、PQ（专业专长），并首创了价值导向评估框架，包含经济可行性、社会影响、伦理对齐和环境可持续性四个维度。

Result: 通过分析200多个基准测试，识别出动态评估需求和可解释性差距等关键挑战，建立了开源评估资源库。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发技术熟练、情境相关且伦理健全的LLM提供了可操作的指导，弥合了基准测试与现实效用之间的差距。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We
maintain a curated repository of open-source evaluation resources at:

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3、TAU2 Airline 45.4、TAU2 Telecom 28.3、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4、ACEBench Agent 82.5，性能优于或匹配更大的开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了多轮动态交互中工具使用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户实现了自主学习和高效工具调用，在多个基准测试中展现了卓越性能。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: VistaWise框架通过跨模态知识整合和高效的数据利用，有效解决了LLM在具身决策任务中的领域知识缺失问题，为低成本高性能代理开发提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和代理AI系统继承了内部和外部信息源的偏见，严重影响检索信息的公平性和用户信任度

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，通过专门化的代理协调工作流程，优化信息源选择以确保检索内容高度相关且偏见最小

Result: 实验结果显示相比基线朴素检索策略，偏见减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该偏见缓解代理系统能有效促进公平平衡的知识传播，提升AI系统的可信度

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统长思维链方法在处理快速直觉型System-1任务时性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂System-2任务的解决能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT)，通过限制使用少量固定的连接词短语来引导模型生成简洁、结构良好的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理轨迹平均约300个token，比基线缩短约三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法通过简洁的连接词约束，实现了推理效率的显著提升，在不损失准确性的前提下大幅缩短推理长度

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

TL;DR: REMO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应优化器，解决了现有方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）存在两个主要问题：1）无状态运行，缺乏历史优化经验的保存和利用机制；2）容易过拟合，生成的提示更新在任务上下文之外泛化能力差。

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含两个核心组件：1）记忆增强的反思RAG模块（结构化错误笔记本）；2）自适应性优化器（通过LLM驱动的元控制器实现），能够合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。通过详细的消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: REMO框架不仅支持类似TextGrad的局部细粒度提示调优，还能系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进，为解决提示优化的过拟合和历史经验利用问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

TL;DR: 提出PAF-KIP方法解决开放集测试时适应问题，通过主辅助过滤器和知识集成预测提升域偏移下的分类准确性和开放集识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在域偏移和开放集样本，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型用于过滤会产生误差累积

Method: 提出主辅助过滤器(PAF)验证过滤数据，以及知识集成预测(KIP)整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识

Result: 在多个封闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在封闭集准确性和开放集判别能力上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不准确和知识整合问题，提升了模型在真实场景中的性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型内部认知与外部响应之间的不一致问题，提升了AI系统的可信度和可靠性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

TL;DR: STARec是一个慢思维增强的推荐代理框架，通过双阶段认知建模（快速响应+慢速推理）和锚定强化训练，显著提升了推荐系统的性能，仅用0.4%的训练数据就超越了现有最佳基线。

Motivation: 现有推荐系统存在静态用户建模和被动决策的局限性，LLM代理过度依赖启发式模式匹配，导致推荐存在浅层相关性偏差、有限因果推理和稀疏数据场景下的脆弱性。

Method: 提出STARec框架：将用户建模为具有并行认知的代理（快速响应+慢速推理的思维链），开发锚定强化训练（结合结构化知识蒸馏和偏好对齐的奖励塑造），通过两阶段训练培养内在慢思维能力。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进的基线方法取得了显著的性能提升，尽管只使用了0.4%的完整训练数据。

Conclusion: STARec通过引入自主审议推理能力，有效解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为构建更智能、更鲁棒的推荐代理提供了新范式。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未被充分理解。研究旨在定义AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求，并评估RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI等增强机制的能力。

Result: 研究发现这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可证明推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 目前AI在法律中最有效的角色是双重身份：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的精密"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Conclusion: FormaRL是一个简单高效的自动形式化强化学习框架，能够显著提升模型性能，同时开源了训练代码和uproof数据集，为高级数学领域的自动形式化和定理证明研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is
open-sourced at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/FormaRL.

Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的广泛应用可能无意中加剧学生表现差距，需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少学生间的差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph图级表示学习方法，以自监督方式分析学生在内容覆盖、学习强度和概念熟练度等多方面的行为和表现。

Result: 实验证明CTGraph能提供学生学习历程的全面视图，识别困难学生，并进行群体比较分析以确定学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了深入了解学生学习历程的丰富洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过生成反事实样本来减少GNN中的虚假相关性，提高检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，在CWE-20漏洞上准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图神经网络的漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到虚假的相关性，导致在真实数据上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出VISION框架：1）使用大语言模型生成反事实样本；2）在具有相反标签的配对代码示例上进行针对性GNN训练；3）基于图的可解释性分析来识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION通过反事实训练有效减少了虚假学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可泛化性，并发布了CWE-20-CFA基准数据集，推动了透明可信的AI网络安全系统发展。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于层次聚类结构的最近邻方法替代神经网络，解决幻觉效应、计算复杂度和灾难性遗忘等问题，通过Kohonen自组织映射加速近邻搜索，在准确率轻微下降的情况下实现数百倍的搜索加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络技术（包括大语言模型）虽然取得了显著成功，但面临幻觉效应、训练推理计算复杂度高、微调成本昂贵和灾难性遗忘等根本性限制，这些限制严重阻碍了神经网络在医学、工业过程管理和科学研究等关键领域的应用。

Method: 采用基于层次聚类结构的k最近邻算法，使用Kohonen自组织映射构建树状数据结构来加速最近邻搜索，避免了整个网络的重新训练需求。

Result: 在手写数字识别和简单字幕翻译任务上的测试证实了该方法的有效性：在准确率仅轻微下降的情况下，最近邻搜索时间相比穷举搜索方法减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制高度契合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中展现出广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构在边缘设备部署受限于有限内存，传统调度方法无法充分利用专家重要性信息，需要更智能的卸载策略来平衡性能和精度。

Method: 利用专家重要性指导卸载决策，用GPU缓存中的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，并设计最大化GPU缓存专家重用率的调度策略。

Result: 实现48%的解码延迟降低，超过60%的专家缓存命中率，同时保持近乎无损的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE在边缘设备部署的内存约束问题，通过智能专家替换和缓存优化显著提升效率。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究探讨大语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能获得复杂的社会规范理解，挑战传统认知科学中强调具身社会经验必要性的理论。

Method: 通过两个研究，系统评估多个AI系统预测555个日常场景中人类社会适宜性判断的能力，比较AI预测与人类集体判断的准确性。

Result: GPT-4.5在预测集体判断方面超越所有人类参与者（100百分位），其他模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5、Claude Sonnet 4也分别超越98.7%、97.8%、96.0%的人类。

Conclusion: 语言作为文化知识传播的丰富储存库，统计学习足以产生复杂的社会认知模型，但AI系统仍存在系统性相关错误，表明基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化的系统转向创建能够持续学习的开放智能体，构建能够通过真实世界交互实现持续进化的自演化智能体。

Method: 提出ELL框架，基于四个核心原则：经验探索（通过自驱动交互学习）、长期记忆（构建持久记忆系统）、技能学习（从经验中抽象可重用技能）、知识内化（将显性经验转化为直觉能力）。同时开发StuLife基准数据集，模拟学生大学生活的三阶段十场景。

Result: 开发了StuLife基准数据集，为评估终身学习能力提供了综合平台，包括记忆保持、技能迁移和自驱动行为等评估维度。

Conclusion: ELL框架为构建持续学习的开放智能体提供了系统方法，StuLife基准为评估终身学习能力提供了重要工具，同时探讨了上下文工程在推进AGI发展中的作用。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的能力，特别是在边缘型人格障碍这种涉及时间性和自我性障碍的疾病分析中，旨在评估AI辅助分析能否减轻人类解释偏差。

Method: 基于24名住院患者的生活故事访谈数据，使用三种LLM模型模仿原始研究者的解释风格，通过盲法和非盲法专家评估，采用语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分等方法进行比较分析。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重合度差异较大（GPT为0%，Claude为42%，Gemini为58%），Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但模型能发现人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的输出最接近人类分析，效度评分显著高于其他模型，且被盲法专家判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有可变性和潜力，能够减轻人类解释偏差，特别是在发现人类可能遗漏的主题方面表现出优势，为现象学定性分析提供了新的辅助工具。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Result: o3模型在5个任务中排名第一，简单黑盒准确率超70%，但复杂黑盒任务准确率下降到40%以下

Conclusion: LLM缺乏高层次规划能力，无法制定高效适应的探索策略来精炼假设

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法在捕捉复杂任务的深度程序逻辑方面仍有不足，研究发现模型性能与训练数据难度存在U型曲线关系——过多低难度数据阻碍抽象能力，而高难度数据显著增强推理能力。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案模板(SST)框架：1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，动态加权损失以优先处理程序逻辑；2)推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3)集成课程微调，显式教授模型自我规划-执行-自我纠正。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试上，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程有效提升了LLMs的程序性推理能力，证明了显式教授推理过程的重要性，为复杂数学问题的解决提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic
information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable
of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of
the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in
Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates
purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

TL;DR: HDS-QA是一个合成数据集，训练大型推理模型区分并行和顺序查询，HybridDeepSearcher模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著减少推理延迟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法顺序集成外部知识检索会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，包含混合跳转问题，结合并行独立子查询和顺序依赖子查询，并微调LRM得到HybridDeepSearcher模型

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp子集上分别获得+15.9和+11.5 F1提升，推理延迟显著减少

Conclusion: 显式训练LRMs利用混合并行和顺序查询具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多集体算法集体行动的理论框架，研究多个集体如何在分类系统中协同植入信号来影响分类器决策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的算法集体行动通常是分散的、由多个目标一致但策略不同的集体组成，但现有研究主要关注单一集体场景，需要理论框架来理解多集体协同行动

Method: 建立多集体算法集体行动的理论框架，分析多个集体通过改变共享数据特征来植入信号，研究集体规模大小和目标对齐程度的相互作用

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标对齐在影响分类器学习过程中的定量分析结果，为多集体协同行动提供了理论支持

Conclusion: 该框架为多集体算法集体行动的整体研究开辟了路径，补充了之前的实证结果，有助于理解现实中分散化集体行动的协同效应

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但现实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观和偏好等深层因素的影响，风格是智能中被忽视的重要维度。

Method: 构建风格形成的双层框架（外部环境交互循环和内部认知思考循环），提出风格容量、风格流行度和演化动态等可测量指标，研究风格定义测量、表达生成和实际应用三个方向。

Result: 提出了基于离散状态空间的通用游戏风格度量方法，探索了强化学习和模仿学习在训练特定风格倾向智能体中的应用，开发了人类风格学习和建模的新方法。

Conclusion: 游戏风格为分析智能体决策提供了新视角，在游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域有应用潜力，未来可作为构建人工通用智能的核心要素。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，整合了安全分类法、基于LLM的评估器BehvJudge和模拟患者代理PatBot，实现了系统化、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析，需要建立安全导向的评估框架。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个核心组件：(1)基于安全工程方法的安全分类法；(2)基于LLM的安全评估器BehvJudge；(3)模拟患者代理PatBot。通过多智能体仿真进行系统性安全评估。

Result: BehvJudge达到专家级危险检测水平(F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999)，在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot能可靠模拟真实患者行为。在2,100个模拟对话中成功评估了5个LLM代理。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持符合监管要求的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

Motivation: 基于中世纪组合术的概念，为现代科研创意提供一种轻量级、可解释的工具，以增强科学创造力并实现人工智能协作创意。

Method: 定义了主题、领域和方法三个组成轴，从人类专家或论文中挖掘元素，然后通过LLM提示组合这些元素来生成科研想法。

Conclusion: 这种现代思考机器提供了一种轻量级、可解释的科学创意增强工具，为人工智能与人类在科研创意方面的协作指明了方向。

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两个主要缺陷：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集的监督微调限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出生成式判断模型StepWiser，通过强化学习使用rollout的相对结果进行训练，模型进行元推理输出思考标记后再给出最终判断

Result: StepWiser在中间步骤的判断准确性优于现有方法，可用于改进策略模型的训练，并提升推理时的搜索效果

Conclusion: 将过程奖励建模重构为推理任务的方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在多个维度上展现出优越性能

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

TL;DR: 本调查首次系统研究模型上下文协议(MCP)作为统一范式，分析其桥接协议级适应与上下文感知决策的能力，提出五类分类法并揭示三个关键见解，最后提出以MCP为基础的研究路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联设备、自主系统和AI应用的快速发展导致自适应传输系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文源相互隔离，需要统一的集成框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析现有文献，提出包含自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构的五类分类法，系统研究MCP作为统一范式的能力。

Result: 研究发现：传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限；MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构实现语义互操作性；AI驱动的传输需要特别适合MCP的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP应作为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能传输基础设施的基础，为碎片化解决方案向标准化集成框架的自然演进提供支持。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

### [50] [Semantic Attractors and the Emergence of Meaning: Towards a Teleological Model of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18290)
*Hans-Joachim Rudolph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了基于复数意义空间中语义吸引子的理论框架，通过张量变换和循环操作建立语义结构，用吸引子算子引导意义向稳定和清晰发展，区别于传统的统计预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的语言模型依赖统计性的下一个词预测，无法真正理解语义。本文旨在探索一种新的认知架构，通过递归张量变换形成意义而非概率推断，以处理反讽、同音异义和歧义等复杂语义现象。

Method: 使用复数空间中的循环操作（涉及虚数单位i）建立旋转语义结构，通过梯度流、张量变形和迭代矩阵动力学来描述语义变换，核心是作为意向性代理的语义吸引子（Microvitum）算子。

Result: 提出了一个数学上具有启发性、哲学上意义重大的语义变换模型，能够建模复杂的语义现象，实现意义向语义一致性的递归收敛。

Conclusion: 真正的意义产生于向语义一致性的递归收敛而非模拟，这需要一种全新的认知架构来塑造语言而不仅仅是预测语言。

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

Motivation: 研究LLM在多智能体系统中的信任形成、错误信息抵抗和同伴输入整合机制，这些因素对复杂社会动态下的集体智能实现至关重要。

Method: 开发KAIROS基准测试模拟问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声群体和对抗性同伴等条件，评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（GRPO）等缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理获得最佳整体性能，但相比基础模型降低了社会影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文和结果奖励能提升LLM性能，但需要平衡性能提升与社会影响鲁棒性之间的关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Motivation: 英语主导网络但多语言内容增长迅速，然而辅助技术对非拉丁语系支持不足，缺乏大规模多语言网页数据集限制了相关研究。

Method: 构建LangCrUX数据集（12种语言12万个网站），进行系统性多语言网页可访问性分析，开发Kizuki语言感知自动化测试扩展工具。

Result: 发现多语言网页普遍忽视可访问性提示，这些提示往往无法反映可见内容的语言多样性，降低了屏幕阅读器有效性。

Conclusion: 多语言网页可访问性存在严重问题，需要语言感知的自动化测试工具来改善屏幕阅读器对非英语内容的支持。

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

Conclusion: PLAST方法可推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务，促进了浅层语言特定视觉信息参与，为多语言视觉理解提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

Motivation: 企业中大语言模型的普及带来了风险，而监控拦技术需要生产级别标签数据来开发稳健的检测器，但在部署前获取真实LLM输出的标签数据很困难。

Method: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级别标签数据，结合稀疏人巡环聚类技术对生成数据进行标注，构建与原始数据集并行但类似真实LLM输出的语料库。

Result: 在健康建议识别这个最难的监控拦任务中，该检测器能够比GPT-4o提高3.73%，而参数数量只有其的1/400。

Conclusion: backprompting方法能够有效生成高质量标签数据，为监控拦技术提供了一种可行的数据生成方案，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了检测精度。

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax自注意力机制经常给语义信息较少的特殊标记和标点符号分配过多权重（注意力噪声问题），现有方法虽然引入负注意力分数但可能丢弃有用信息。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer，一种新颖的自注意力机制，通过整合从logit分布中采样的信号来去噪注意力，同时保留对模型性能至关重要的特殊标记的贡献。

Result: 在多个知识推理语言基准测试中，该模型优于vanilla、Cog和Differential注意力变体；分析显示在底层使用vanilla自注意力可提升性能，Integral Transformer能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层rank collapse。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer成功解决了注意力噪声问题，在保持模型性能的同时实现了更好的注意力分布平衡，为Transformer架构提供了有效的注意力机制改进方案。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

*Jeong-seok Oh,Jay-yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LSC通过可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短式和长式推理基准测试中均优于现有方法，计算开销可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂或长式问题上的概率解码输出不一致问题，现有方法在短式和长式回答格式间存在准确率权衡

Method: 使用可学习的token嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，通过轻量级前向生成摘要token，推理时间增加不到1%且无需改变模型架构

Result: 在6个短式和5个长式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有测试上平均超越SC、USC和WUCS方法，同时保持可忽略的计算开销

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，能提供良好校准的置信度估计，在两种答案格式上都保持低期望校准误差

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了OOD评估能有效反映模型在现实世界部署中失败模式的假设，发现不同QA数据集的OOD评估对模型抗捷径能力的估计质量差异很大，部分甚至不如简单的同分布评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI研究主要通过OOD数据集评估模型泛化能力，但这种评估基于一个强假设：OOD评估能够捕捉和反映现实部署中的可能失败。本文质疑这一假设的有效性。

Method: 将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式（依赖虚假特征或预测捷径）进行对比分析，研究不同QA数据集在OOD评估中的表现差异。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集对模型抗捷径能力的评估质量差异显著，部分数据集的表现甚至不如简单的同分布评估。观察到虚假捷径在ID和OOD数据集间共享，但也存在训练和评估质量脱节的情况。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用OOD泛化评估方法的局限性，为在QA及其他领域更稳健地评估泛化能力提供了方法论和建议。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了不同训练方法对大语言模型在重新排序任务中语义理解能力的影响，并研究模型是否能生成具有解释性的文本推理来应对透明性和训练数据不足的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型语义理解能力的提升，它们更加符合人类价值观，但这以透明性为代价。虽然实验分析取得了有望的结果，但深入理解LLM的内部工作机制对理解重新排序的推理过程至关重要，以向终端用户提供解释。同时，在新开发的系统中，用户参与有限且排序数据不足，准确重新排序内容仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 研究使用环境和地球科学领域的相对小型排序数据集来重新排序检索到的内容。分析不同训练方法对LLM在重新排序任务中语义理解能力的影响，并研究模型是否能生成具有信息的文本推理。同时分析可解释信息，以确定重新排序是否能通过解释性来进行推理。

Result: 分析发现某些训练方法比其他方法具有更好的可解释性，这意味着并非所有训练方法都能够学习到准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估，这引发了对LLM真正可靠性的质疑。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了选择适当训练方法对于基于LLM的重新排序系统的重要性，因为不同的训练方法在语义理解和解释性方面存在显著差异。研究结果指出需要更深入地研究LLM的内部工作机制，以确保模型的真正可靠性和透明性。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

TL;DR: 该研究通过IPIS数据集微调大语言模型，为波兰语设计性别包容性系统提示，旨在解决波兰语中男性偏见的语言生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波兰语由于历史和政治惯例，主要使用男性形式来指代男性、女性和混合性别群体，导致大语言模型继承并强化了这种性别偏见，产生性别不平衡的输出。

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（包含人工制作的性别包容性校对和波兰语到英语翻译指令）微调多语言LLMs（Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo）和波兰语特定LLMs（Bielik和PLLuM），并基于理论语言学框架设计明确的性别包容性系统提示。

Result: 研究开发了一种系统性方法，将性别包容性作为这些模型的内在特征，有效减轻波兰语生成中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决波兰语中的性别偏见问题提供了系统性的解决方案，能够使大语言模型生成更加性别平衡的输出内容。

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然强大但容易产生幻觉，即生成看似自信但实际错误或无意义的回答，需要有效的检测方法来识别这些不可靠的输出。

Method: 采用多重检验假设测试框架，将幻觉检测问题形式化为统计假设检验，借鉴机器学习中分布外检测的思路来识别模型生成内容中的幻觉。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法在检测幻觉方面表现出强大的鲁棒性，优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多重检验假设测试方法为检测大语言模型幻觉提供了一种有效且可靠的解决方案，能够显著提升对模型输出可信度的评估能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出两种新的机器翻译自动评估指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过引入额外翻译信息来提升评估性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评估指标仅考虑单个翻译，而人类评估时会参考多个备选翻译，这种差异影响了自动指标的性能

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句的多个翻译进行比较；COMET-polyic基于检索式上下文学习，输入相似源文本的翻译及其人工评分

Result: COMET-polycand加入单个额外翻译即可提升段级指标性能（Kendall's tau-b从0.079提升至0.118），COMET-polyic也获得类似改进（0.079到0.116）

Conclusion: 引入额外翻译信息能显著提升机器翻译自动评估指标的性能，模型已公开发布

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自评估视觉隐喻生成框架，通过源-目标-意义分解和意义对齐指标来提升隐喻生成质量，包含训练无关和基于训练的两种方法，在多项指标上超越强基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时理解语言隐喻的深层含义并保持视觉连贯性，现有方法在隐喻对齐方面存在不足，需要更好的评估和生成框架。

Method: 提出自评估框架，结合新提出的隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标；开发两种方法：训练无关的S-T-M分解提示管道，以及基于训练的自我评估奖励方案改进对齐。

Result: 训练无关方法在分解、CLIP和MA分数上超越GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线；用户研究显示GPT-4o整体更受偏好，但训练无关方法在开源方法中领先并在抽象隐喻上优于Imagen。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习在适度计算下能有效进行隐喻对齐，与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样设置敏感性。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型的本质：它们是否真正模拟了人类语言能力，还是仅仅是对训练语料库的模建

Method: 通过对比Transformer机制的线性处理格式与人类语言计算的超线性格式，结合Liu等人(2022)关于短接自动机的理论进行分析

Result: 识别出Transformer机制在计算格式上的本质限制，提出LLM通过不同方式学会了使用语言这种"话语机器"

Conclusion: 语言不仅是内部状态的表达工具，而是一种能够根据语境生成新语言的机制，人类和LLM通过不同途径学会了使用这种技术

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Conclusion: NOOV系统有效解决了EHR翻译中的关键挑战，为临床医学翻译提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

Result: 核心发现：知识记忆能力对有效位宽、校准集大小和模型规模的变化显示出明显更高的敏感性，而知识利用能力则更加稳健

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对量化影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供了指导

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

<details>

Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务（如数学）中表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据中缺乏人类思考过程中的关键insights（意图和方法论），这些insights对于连接推理步骤至关重要。

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，在连续推理步骤间主动生成insights来指导推理过程，并设计自动化管道收集和过滤上下文示例，避免人工标注和微调开销。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上的实验验证了TBYS的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insights来模拟人类思考过程，TBYS框架能够有效提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，且无需额外的人工标注或模型微调。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在整合外部知识时无法同时保持忠实性和表达性，导致输出或缺乏知识支持或过于繁琐不自然。需要突破这一限制。

Method: 提出协同解码(CoDe)方法，通过分布散度和模型信心度指导，动态整合有无外部知识的输出概率。同时使用知识感知重排机制，防止过度依赖参数知识但保证外部信息的正确利用。

Result: 经过全面实验，CoDe框架在各种大语言模型和评估指标上都显示出优异性能，在不損害表达性的前提下显著提升了忠实性。

Conclusion: CoDe作为一种即插即用的框架，有效解决了大语言模型在知识基础下的忠实性与表达性的交易问题，验证了其效果性和通用性。

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

Result: 成功构建了支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决有限数据下开发具有情感理解能力的语音LLM提供了有效方案

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 当前医学视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在答案不一致性问题，本文构建了RoMed数据集并提出了CCL方法，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和答案一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗应用中，模型需要对语义相同的医学问题给出一致的回答，但现有Med-VLMs在面对问题重述时表现出严重的脆弱性，答案波动很大。

Method: 构建了包含14.4万个问题的RoMed数据集，包含词汇级、句子级和语义级扰动。提出了CCL方法，包含知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习两个组件。

Result: 在RoMed测试集上，SOTA模型如LLaVA-Med的召回率下降40%。CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并将答案一致性提升了50%。

Conclusion: CCL方法通过整合医学知识一致性和偏差感知对比学习，有效解决了Med-VLMs的鲁棒性问题，显著提升了医疗诊断的可靠性。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: 提出了Attention2Probability方法，通过注意力权重转换和课程学习，显著提升语音大模型中专业术语和新生词的识别准确率，在中文和英文测试中分别达到92.57%和86.83%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域的语音识别和翻译已有进步，但在准确生成领域特定术语或新生词方面仍存在挑战，需要专门的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Attention2Probability方法：将语音和术语之间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，采用课程学习提高检索准确性，并创建了包含术语的语音数据集。

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中文最大召回率92.57%，英文86.83%，单查询延迟仅8.71ms。术语干预使SLM的术语准确率提升6-17%。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、灵活且准确，有效提升了语音到文本系统中术语处理的鲁棒性，同时揭示了当前SLM在术语利用方面仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应原创性过滤(AOF)提示框架，通过余弦相似度拒绝冗余生成，在跨语言谜语生成任务中显著提升GPT-4o的词汇多样性和减少冗余


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言谜语生成需要平衡文化流畅性和创造性抽象，但标准提示策略往往重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写

Method: 引入自适应原创性过滤(AOF)框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制来过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对的评估中，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性提升和冗余减少

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以在无需任务特定微调的情况下指导文化基础扎实的创造性生成

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: EMMM框架在客户服务场景中有效平衡了延迟、准确性和可解释性需求，为可信赖的AI部署提供了实用解决方案，相关代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重。需要同时兼顾质量和多样性来吸引更广泛的受众群体。

Method: 提出DIVER框架：1）设计语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动产生高质量训练对；2）采用多阶段多目标优化，结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)，实现单次前向传播生成高质量多样化标题。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上验证，DIVER有效平衡了质量和多样性。部署在服务数亿用户的大规模内容共享平台上，广告价值(ADVV)提升4.0%，点击率(CTR)提升1.4%。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量和多样性的平衡问题，通过LLM联合优化实现了显著的商业价值提升，为现代广告生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了M3HG模型和MECAD数据集，用于解决多模态对话中情感原因三元组提取任务的数据稀缺和现有方法性能不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态情感原因三元组提取(MECTEC)领域面临两个主要问题：1）数据集稀缺，仅有一个公开数据集且对话场景单一；2）现有方法未能显式建模情感和因果上下文，且忽略了不同层次语义信息的融合。

Method: 提出M3HG模型，通过多模态异构图显式捕捉情感和因果上下文，并在话语间和话语内两个层次有效融合上下文信息。同时构建了MECAD数据集，包含来自56部电视剧的989个对话，涵盖多样化对话场景。

Result: 大量实验证明M3HG模型相比现有最先进方法具有显著有效性。

Conclusion: M3HG模型和MECAD数据集为多模态情感原因三元组提取任务提供了有效的解决方案，解决了数据稀缺和模型性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构分散信息为连贯段落并显式保持时间顺序，在叙事问答任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的时序关系，而不仅仅是孤立的片段。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：将分散的文档信息精炼为连贯的结构化段落；通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验表明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂时序关系理解的任务中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 时序推理对于解决叙事问答至关重要，ChronoRAG通过专门处理叙事文本的时序特性，有效提升了长上下文问答的性能。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的链式推理能力强大但计算成本高，开源社区缺乏像GPT系列那样的可控推理能力，需要开发可调节推理强度的开源解决方案

Method: 端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调嵌入可控推理能力，两阶段预算感知强化学习配合自适应奖励塑造，实现三种操作模式切换

Result: 成功实现三种推理模式：高性能模式（全能力）、中模式（50% token减少，性能下降<10%）、低模式（75% token减少，性能下降<15%）

Conclusion: ThinkDial框架有效实现了目标压缩-性能权衡，在分布外任务上表现出强泛化能力，为开源社区提供了实用的可控推理解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器方法在语法纠错中已有一定成功，但大语言模型在该领域的应用仍未被充分探索。当前研究主要依赖监督微调让LLM直接生成修正句子，这限制了模型强大的推理能力

Method: 基于规则强化学习（Rule-Based RL）的新框架，通过强化学习来引导大语言模型

Result: 在中文数据集上实现了state-of-the-art性能，召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 使用强化学习引导大语言模型具有明显优势，为语法纠错领域的未来发展提供了更可控和可靠的范式

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans为翻译LaTeX格式文档提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，能够很好地保持格式保存、结构保真和术语一致性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的自监督假新闻检测方案，通过结合语义和传播特征，在零样本学习场景下也能获得优异性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands

systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3

fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和提示工程的快速发展，自动选择优化提示的需求日益增长，需要更精确和全面的搜索方法来找到最优提示

Method: 基于进化算法的自反进化方法，在交叉和精英变异前使用短期和长期反射操作来提升修改质量，积累进化过程中的知识并在每个周期更新

Result: 在33个分类和文本生成数据集上测试，使用t-lite-instruct-0.1和gemma3-27b-it模型，相比最先进方法平均显著提升28%（在BBH数据集上）

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法基础自动提示中最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射进化方法实现了更精确和全面的最优提示搜索

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，用于处理计算教育研究中的大量文本数据，帮助研究者进行大规模、严谨且可重复的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)中，研究者常因缺乏同事、资源或能力而难以进行具有普适性和严谨性的研究。需要一种能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究者负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大型语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模研究。通过计算教育数据集展示了该方法的可重复性和严谨性。

Result: LACA方法能够帮助研究者从更广泛的研究中获得更具普适性的发现，为CER领域提供了有效的大规模文本数据分析解决方案。

Conclusion: LACA方法及其类似技术的发展有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平，推动该领域的进步。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

TL;DR: 通过自动化语言处理分析六个欧洲国家议会演讲，发现它们都存在一致的情感两极化现象，且互息性是其中的重要机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感两极化在欧洲议会中的存在情况，这种现象特征是对立场对立群体的负面情感和敌意性增强。

Method: 采用自动化自然语言处理技术，分析六个欧洲国家议会的演讲语料，通过比较对对立群体和自身群体的负面情感表达来评估情感两极化。

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了一致的情感两极化现象。活跃度与负面情感相关，但活跃度不同的议员在情感两极化方面没有显著差异。互息性是议员之间情感两极化的重要机制。

Conclusion: 情感两极化是欧洲政治论坛的普遍现象，且互息性在其中起着关键作用，这为理解和应对政治两极化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估主要集中在性能指标，而忽视了数据集质量和隐私保护这些实际约束，影响评估的可靠性和可信过程

Method: 使用多段代理框架：(1)多样性代理利用聚类技术最大化主题覆盖和语义变量性；(2)隐私代理检测和隐藏多领域敏感信息；(3)QA精选代理合成具有隐私性和多样性的QA对作为RAG评估的真实标准

Result: 实验结果显示，该评估集在多样性方面超过基准方法，并在领域特定数据集上实现了稳健的隐私隐藏效果

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条符合道德规范的实用路径，实现更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估，为未来沿着AI监管和遵循标准发展的增强功能奠定了基础

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Motivation: 传统的事后解释方法存在局限性，需要将推理直接嵌入到模型表示中，实现真正的内在可解释性，同时保持神经模型的灵活性。

Method: 引入互补训练目标增强符号纯度和决策稀疏性，采用序列专业化策略先建立广泛的符号能力再细化直觉判断，使用门控归纳机制指导选择性关注。

Result: 在AI任务上展示了具有竞争力的准确性，同时提供可验证的推理轨迹，证明AI母语可以作为神经网络模型中可解释性、直觉和符号推理的统一机制。

Conclusion: AI母语框架成功实现了将符号推理与神经表示相结合，为构建既强大又可解释的AI系统提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to

utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights

TL;DR: HiPlan是一个分层规划框架，通过全局-局部自适应指导来提升LLM智能体的决策能力，解决了复杂长时程规划中的方向迷失和执行偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在决策任务中表现出色，但在复杂长时程规划场景中缺乏宏观指导和持续监督，容易迷失方向和产生执行偏差。

Method: 采用分层规划框架：离线阶段从专家演示构建里程碑库；执行阶段动态适配轨迹片段生成逐步提示，将当前观察与里程碑目标对齐。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的基准测试中，HiPlan显著优于强基线方法，消融研究验证了其分层组件的互补效益。

Conclusion: HiPlan通过层次化分解和动态适配机制，有效解决了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的指导缺失问题，提升了决策性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Method: 使用ACI-bench数据集，与医疗专业人员合作开发基于SOAP框架的细粒度意图分类法，通过Prolific平台批量标注超过5000个医生-病人对话转换，并用现有生成和编码器模型进行性能测试。

Result: 模型能高精度理解医疗对话的一般结构，但在识别SOAP类别过渡时常失败，首次报告了医疗对话结构的常见轨迹，意图过滤能显著提升医疗对话摘要性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗意图分类提供了重要的标注数据集和分析见解，显示了现有模型的优势和不足，为医疗对话系统的设计和改进提供了价值。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言，特别是使用罕见文字的语言，在大语言模型中缺乏支持，主要原因是训练数据匮乏。本文旨在分析LLMs是否能够通过上下文学习来获取这些语言能力。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三种最先进的多语言LLMs上测试了上下文学习(ICL)和参数高效微调(PEFT)方法，包括零样本和少样本设置。

Result: 当语言及其文字在LLM中代表性极低时，PEFT存在局限性。零样本ICL加语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著，而少样本ICL或PEFT更适合相对资源较多的语言。

Conclusion: 为LLM从业者提供了针对极低资源语言的实用指南，建议避免对未见文字的语言进行多语言模型微调，优先使用零样本ICL加语言对齐的方法。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合语义检索和上下文摘要技术，实现对Getty来源索引中拍卖记录的自然语言和多语言搜索，减少对元数据结构的依赖。

Result: 在Getty来源索引-德国拍卖记录的10,000条样本上评估显示，该方法能够有效检索和摘要拍卖记录，为艺术市场档案导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为历史学家和文化遗产专业人士进行历史敏感性研究提供了实用工具，能够有效处理艺术品来源研究的复杂数据挑战。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically
sensitive research.

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of
Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box
software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency
and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent
framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable
triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study
in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines
using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over
preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our
iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)对自身知识边界的感知能力，通过评估三种置信度信号(概率置信度、答案一致性置信度和语言化置信度)，发现LVLMs有一定感知能力但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中表现出色但存在幻觉问题，可靠的模型应该能够感知自身的知识边界，知道什么知道什么不知道。

Method: 在三个LVLM模型和三个VQA数据集上评估三种置信度信号，并采用从大型语言模型(LLMs)中借鉴的置信度校准方法来提升感知能力。

Result: 概率置信度和一致性置信度是更可靠的指标，语言化置信度往往导致过度自信。联合处理视觉和文本输入会降低问答性能但减少置信度，相比LLMs有更好的感知水平。

Conclusion: LVLMs具有一定程度的自我知识边界感知能力，但仍有很大改进空间。通过适当的置信度校准方法可以提升其感知能力，视觉信息的加入有助于改善模型对自身能力的认知。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长语音合成中多说话人对话建模的挑战，需要开发能够高效处理长序列并保持音频保真度的模型

Method: 采用next-token扩散方法，通过新型连续语音分词器对连续数据进行建模，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩

Result: 能够合成长达90分钟的多说话人对话语音（最多4人），在64K上下文窗口长度下超越开源和专有对话模型

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功实现了高质量的长对话语音合成，显著提升了计算效率和音频质量

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

*Isabel Cachola,Daniel Khashabi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 传统可读性指标在普通语言摘要中与人类判断相关性差，语言模型能更好地评估可读性，特别是对背景知识等深层因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普通语言摘要(PLS)领域使用传统可读性指标(如FKGL)作为标准，但这些指标在PLS中尚未与人类可读性判断进行比较验证。

Method: 评估8种传统可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，测试语言模型作为可读性评估工具的性能，并在PLS数据集上进行扩展分析。

Result: 大多数传统指标与人类判断相关性差，最佳语言模型达到0.56的皮尔逊相关系数。语言模型能更好地捕捉背景知识等深层可读性因素。

Conclusion: 建议在普通语言摘要评估中使用语言模型而非传统指标，并发布了分析代码和调查数据。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了生成式界面范式，让LLM主动生成用户界面来替代传统线性对话，在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中显著提升用户体验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的线性请求-响应格式在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，需要更自适应的交互方式

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面框架，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验方面均优于传统对话界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互提供了新的发展方向，明确了用户偏好生成式界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

### [101] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究水下3D物体检测的无训练方法，对比了基于合成数据的深度学习和基于模型的模板匹配方法。结果显示模板匹配方法在真实水下环境中更具稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D物体检测面临训练数据稀缺和获取成本高的挑战，需要开发不依赖真实训练数据的可靠检测方法。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）基于物理模拟的合成数据生成流程，用于训练最新神经网络；2）基于几何先验知识的模型基于模板匹配系统。

Result: 在波罗的海真实测深调查中，神经网络在合成数据上达到98% mAP，但在真实数据上下降到40%；而模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP，且不需要训练。

Conclusion: 这项研究挑战了深度学习在水下领域需要大量数据的传统观念，为自主水下载具导航、海洋考古学和离岸基础设施监测等数据稀缺环境开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种叫MobileDenseAttn的双流模型，通过融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201来提高脑罐棵MRI图像识别的准确性、效率和可解释性，在6,020张扫描图上达到了98.35%的测试准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑罐棵检测方法存在几大问题：对异质性罐棵的普适性有限、计算效率低、可解释性差以及缺乏透明度，影响了临床信任度。所以需要开发一种更高效、更可靠的自动化检测方法。

Method: 设计了MobileDenseAttn双流模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的优势，使用特征层融合技术。模型在经过增帽的6,020张MRI扫描图上训练，包含贝米罐棵、脑膜瘤、脯体罐棵和正常样本。采用严格的5折交叉验证协议，并使用GradCAM提供可解释的视觉化分析。

Result: 模型在训练集上达到99.75%的准确率，测试集上达到98.35%的准确率，F1分数为0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920）。与基线模型（VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2）相比，准确率提高了3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热力图清晰显示了罐棵受影响区域，提供了临床意义上的定位信息。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn被证明是一种高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有高度的临床应用潜力。该模型在准确性、效率和可解释性方面都显著超过了现有方法，有望成为真实世界中识别脑罐棵的实用临床工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面存在系统性缺陷，当实体参考为视觉而非文本时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，模型难以将实体内部知识与图像表示相连接


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是模型在处理视觉参考与文本参考时表现差异的问题

Method: 通过控制研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用内部状态模式探测来识别模型不可靠响应的情况，并在视觉问答任务中应用选择性预测

Result: 强制VLMs依赖图像表示会使事实知识回忆能力减半，内部状态探测达到92%以上的准确率来标记不可靠响应，在视觉问答任务中覆盖率提高7.87%同时降低错误风险0.9%

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性缺陷，内部状态探测可有效识别模型失败情况，这为语言基础研究提供了重要方向和改进建议

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Motivation: 解决稀疏图像输入中特征不匹配导致的严重辐射渡漏问题，提高神经隐式表示的表达能力。

Method: 在签名距离场和辐射场优化中添加片段语义逻辑值，并使用基于几何原始掩码的新额外正则化来减少形状游离。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS和VolRecon，平均Chamfer距离分别减少44%和20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo的插件时，平均误差分别降低69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义信息丰富化和形状正则化，有效解决了稀疏视角下的3D重建问题，显著提高了重建质量。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，手动识别困难且耗时，需要自动化检测方法。但高质量公开数据集稀缺，且复杂模型容易过拟合

Method: 使用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合问题，并采用集成融合技术结合最佳模型

Result: 集成模型在二元分类任务中取得92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%灵敏度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成方法能有效检测非法垃圾填埋场，避免过拟合，在AerialWaste数据集上表现出色

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU是一个新颖的多模态情感分析框架，通过整合模态特定结构信息和跨模态语义对齐来提升多模态表示质量，在性能和计算效率上都优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视了模态特定的结构依赖性和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU)框架：1) 动态构建模态特定图（文本使用语言语法，音视频使用轻量级文本引导注意力机制）；2) 引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；3) 开发多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准数据集上 consistently 达到state-of-the-art性能，同时显著降低计算开销

Conclusion: SSU框架有效解决了多模态情感分析中的结构依赖性和语义对齐问题，具有优异的性能、可解释性和计算效率

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸3D重建框架，能够在10毫秒内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3D模型，比优化方法快1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅人脸生成方法要么需要每张人脸单独优化（速度慢），要么前馈方法重建质量较差。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又能实现实时推理的解决方案。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先从多视角人脸数据构建3DGS模板模型，然后将输入图像编码为身份特定且姿态不变的潜在嵌入，解码后预测模板高斯参数残差。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），运行速度比优化方法（如FlashAvatar）快1000倍，并支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过结合优秀的重建质量和极快的推理速度，扩展了3D高斯泼溅在消费级和交互式系统中逼真头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会给处于脆弱环境的数据主体带来隐私风险，需要开发适合这些场景的生物特征模板保护方案。

Method: 通过系统分析功能、操作和安全隐私需求，比较现有BTP方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有效、模块化且计算轻量的生物特征模板保护方案，适用于人道主义紧急场景，未来计划开源代码以促进应用。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在需要显式推理实体、角色和空间时间关系的任务上表现局限，而这种关系能力对于精细人类行为识别、主视视频理解和多模态医学图像分析至关重要。

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成轻量级、上下文适配的图推理模块，通过动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推断）来实现显式关系推理。

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑红管分割等领域的跨领域实验中，增强图推理模块的混合模型在精细语义保真度、分布外稳健性、可解释性和计算效率方面都超过了单纯基础模型。同时通过语义节点的稀疏推理实现了更好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了一个针对基础模型图混合结构的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构构建、多级关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接测试结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专家-通才框架，用于皮肤病视觉问答，通过结合轻量级图像分类器和压缩的对话模型，在提高诊断准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，实现临床部署的可行性。

Method: 采用专家-通才分层设计：轻量级图像分类器（专家）提供快速诊断预测，压缩的对话VLM（通才）生成自然语言解释，并通过知识图谱检索确保回答的准确性。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集上，诊断准确性比最强基线提高18%，平均VRAM需求降低至少20%，延迟减少至少5%。

Conclusion: 专家-通才系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型来检测监控视频中的异常事件，无需在训练时接触异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖上下文。传统方法需要异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以更好地处理未知异常。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到未见过的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架通过结合时空建模和语义理解，为监控视频中的异常检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个自监督的3D场景流估计框架，利用4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签，无需人工标注即可实现高性能的LiDAR场景流估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景中性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注，难以扩展。需要开发无需人工标注的高性能场景流估计方法。

Method: 提出跨模态标签转移方法，从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和模糊解析传播将其转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著优于现有自监督方法，仅需10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow证明了利用雷达多普勒信息进行自监督学习的有效性，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的安全导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一种从卫星图像和粗略几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过建模从噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图中恢复准确建筑结构，而3D细节化方法依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如长方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现无需额外计算成本的灵活几何控制，并开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines解决了现有方法在卫星图像3D建筑生成中的局限性，通过创新的几何转换建模实现了准确且灵活的建筑生成。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种两阶段深度学习模型，用于从游戏帧中检测可穿越空间过渡点（STP）并选择主要过渡点（MSTP），为自动地图生成和游戏关卡设计提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图生成和关卡设计评估至关重要。需要一种对单帧游戏图像进行过渡点检测和分类的对象性方法。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习流水线：首先使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，然后用轻量级MSTP选择器给过湰点排序，融合局部和全局视觉特征。采用参数高效的adapter技术，还包含可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五款动作RPG游戏的自建数据集上验证。完整网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更好，adapter仅转移在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健高效。

Conclusion: 通过定义这个新题、提供基准流程和数据集，以及对高效模型适配的初步见解，为未来AI驱动的导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具做出了贡献。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在复杂的影视制作中（需要细腻角色互动、真实身体动作和动态镜头）表现不足，需要解决实现电影级角色动画的长期挑战。

Method: 基于Wan构建的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，专门针对电影级动画需求设计，能够处理复杂的角色互动、身体动作和镜头运动。

Result: 在广泛实验中，与Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等尖端模型相比，该方法始终显著优于现有解决方案，在电影场景中实现了显著增强的表现力和保真度。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V模型成功解决了电影级角色动画的挑战，在表达能力和真实性方面超越了现有最先进方法，并展示了在长视频生成和精确唇形同步编辑方面的应用潜力。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Motivation: 现有方法在癌症生存分析中面临两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，MoE融合方法中各专家网络处理分离特征限制了信息交互

Method: 提出Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion框架，包含模态解耦、随机特征重组和动态MoE融合模块，并在解耦模块中引入区域交叉注意力网络

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上的广泛实验证实了所提方法的有效性

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过特征重组策略增强了特征组合多样性，克服了信息封闭问题，提高了专家网络对解耦特征间信息的捕获能力

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（如阴影、反射等）时表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏成对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器构建视频修复模型；引入额外监督来显式预测受副作用影响的区域。

Result: ROSE在多种副作用移除任务上表现出色，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据生成，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Motivation: 解决现有视频描述方法中存在的动作-细节失衡问题，模型往往过分强调某一方面而忽略另一方面，导致描述不完整和不一致性

Method: 1) 数据方面：构建HMD-270K数据集，包含两阶段流程：动作-细节融合(MDF)和细粒度审查(FGE)
2) 优化方面：提出基于组相对策略优化(GRPO)的描述集等效奖励(CSER)，通过单元-集匹配和双向验证提升完整性和准确性

Conclusion: 通过数据集构建和优化策略的双重措施，成功解决了视频描述中的动作-细节失衡问题，OwlCap模型实现了更完整和准确的视频描述，为视频理解和生成领域提供了有力支持

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Motivation: 现有基于空间域SNR先验的方法存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出频域SNR先验方法，将特征分解为幅度和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)结合频谱交互和SNR线索；使用频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈融合高低频分支；集成在统一U型架构中

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验方法优于现有方法，能更有效地处理水下图像增强问题

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Conclusion: 分层时空网络设计有效提升了超声心动图视频中左心室分割和EF估计的准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低下、可解释性差和难以扩展到现代架构的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，保持特征编码器冻结，通过利用预训练模型特征空间中的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）来优化决策边界。该方法支持离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能。能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一个简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，特别是在域适应任务中，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的混合深度学习框架，通过定制InceptionV3、LSTM架构和集成特征选择策略，实现了高效的人体活动识别，在UCF-YouTube数据集上达到99.65%准确率，特征减少至7个，支持边缘设备实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人体活动识别系统面临高计算成本、冗余特征和实时场景可扩展性有限等关键挑战，需要开发轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Method: 集成定制InceptionV3提取空间特征，LSTM建模时序依赖，采用集成遗传算法(ADFSA)进行特征选择，平衡准确性、冗余性、独特性和复杂度。

Result: 在UCF-YouTube数据集上实现99.65%识别准确率，特征数量减少至7个，推理时间显著提升，支持Raspberry Pi等边缘设备实时部署。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了轻量级、可扩展的HAR解决方案，适用于智能监控、辅助技术和自主监控系统等资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和基准数据集(EndoNeRF, StereoMIS)上达到39.85 PSNR(比先前3DGS方法高1.5)和97.25% SSIM，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用至关重要。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在类别不平衡数据集上训练时，模型预测偏向多数类而导致少数类识别性能显著下降的问题

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别级别，为每个类别设置基于类别频率的特定洪水阈值，抑制多数类过拟合同时允许少数类充分学习

Result: 在图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提升了少数类的分类性能并获得更好的整体泛化能力

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理类别不平衡问题的有效方法，能够平衡不同类别的学习过程，提高模型整体性能

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADM难度度量方法，结合课程学习和SAM优化，解决平坦区域中样本难度评估难题，提升模型泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度范数来评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得无效，无法有效结合课程学习和SAM优化

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本和对抗样本的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性，在平坦区域仍保持有效性，并将其集成到基于SAM的课程学习框架中

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上验证，方法同时保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，优于现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦最小值区域有效评估样本难度的方法，成功实现了课程学习与SAM优化的有机结合，显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测面临图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战，不同物种检测性能差异显著但原因不明，需要探究数据量之外的影响因素并系统改进低性能海洋物种检测。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验来识别根本原因。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最具挑战性的阶段，与数据量无关；分类实验显示即使数据平衡仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的内在特征挑战。

Conclusion: 建议在优先精度时使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布；改进低性能类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面；公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法填补了从2D工程图纸自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究空白，为工业设计工作流程提供了更符合传统实践的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Motivation: 现有视听语音识别系统在噪声环境中难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖，导致识别性能下降

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合的路由器，基于token级声学损坏分数自适应重新加权音频和视觉特征，通过门控交叉注意力机制在解码器层中降权不可靠音频token并增强视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的相对词错误率降低，消融研究证实路由器和门控机制都有助于提升真实声学噪声下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效应对音频质量恶化情况，使模型能够转向视觉模态，显著提升了噪声环境下的视听语音识别性能

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Result: 该方法允许直接比较通用VLM与专门HOI方法，提供了更全面的HOI理解进展观察

Conclusion: 新的评价标准能够更公平地评估不同方法在HOI检测任务上的表现，为预计的合理解释提供了评价空间

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Method: 构建印象标签共现图（节点为印象标签，边编码共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 与BERT和CLIP相比，该方法在定性和定量评估中表现更好，特别是在印象引导的字体生成任务中。

Conclusion: 基于形状-印象关系的谱嵌入方法能够更好地表示字体印象，为印象驱动的字体生成和检索应用提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

TL;DR: 使用预训练远感基础模型的深度特征在荷兰实现了树种分类准确度显著提升，超过传统方法10%，为国家森林调查提供了更高效的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家森林调查需要芯牌劳动强度的现场调查，而遥感技术结合机器学习可以更频繁地更新调查数据。虽然卫星影像时间序列在区分树种方面有效，但当前方法主要依赖手工设计的特征和物候指标。

Method: 使用预训练的远感基础模型提取深度特征，通过少量标签数据进行细调。从Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5卫星数据和SRTM数据中提取时间序列数据，利用Google Earth Engine进行数据处理。

Result: 细调公开可用的远感时间序列基础模型在荷兰NFI分类中表现出色，比当前最先进方法准确度提升达10%，在所有数据集上都有显著攻势。

Conclusion: 经典的手工设计调和特征对于树种分类任务过于简单，深度AI特征在数据有限的应用中具有巨大潜力。通过利用公开可用的卫星数据和预训练模型，这种方法可以有效补充现有的森林调查过程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种先验指导的视频级回归方法，用于微表情分析，通过可扩展的区间选择策略和协同优化框架，实现了超过现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情分析现有方法主要依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，无法抓取微表情的复杂时间动态。虽有视频级回归框架部分解决了这些问题，但区间解码仍依赖手工预定义的窗口方法，问题仍未彻底解决。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可扩展的区间选择策略和协同优化框架，有效解决了微表情分析中的时间动态抓取问题，实现了准确的起始、高潮和结束阶段检测，在多个标准数据集上达到了独创性能。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Motivation: 微科手术网状合需要高超技能，但现有评估方法依赖主观判断，存在偏差和可靠性问题

Method: 利用来自多个医院不同水平参与者的数据集，通过图像处理技术建立定量框架，包括错误的几何建模和检测评分机制

Result: 几何指标能够有效地复现专家评分者对该工作中考虑的错误的评分

Conclusion: 该方法提高了微科手术技能评估的效率和可靠性，推进了培训协议的发展

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的视频稳定方法，通过测试时快速自适应来改进像素级合成视频稳定技术，利用推理时的低级视觉线索提升输出稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级合成视频稳定方法虽然能合成全帧输出，但由于视频序列中运动模式和视觉内容的多样性，使用固定参数难以实现鲁棒泛化。

Method: 采用快速自适应策略，在测试时针对每个输入视频快速调整模型；提出急动定位模块和针对性自适应策略，专注于高急动片段进行优化；利用推理时可用的低级视觉线索。

Result: 即使单次自适应也能获得显著性能提升；在各种真实数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性；持续改进多种全帧合成模型的性能，包括下游应用结果。

Conclusion: 该方法使现代稳定器能够超越现有SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并提供类似经典方法的用户控制机制。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

TL;DR: DualFairVL是一个多模态提示学习框架，通过并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，实现跨模态解耦对齐表示，在医疗影像诊断中显著提升公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗诊断中确保跨人口群体的公平性至关重要，特别是在影像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下。现有去偏方法通常独立处理视觉和文本模态，存在残留的跨模态错位和公平性差距。

Method: 提出DualFairVL框架：1）并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性；2）通过线性投影构建近似正交文本锚点；3）超网络生成实例感知视觉提示；4）原型正则化强化敏感特征分离和文本锚点对齐。

Result: 在8个医疗影像数据集（4种模态）上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就优于全微调和参数高效基线方法。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和跨模态对齐，有效解决了医疗影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型对不同人口群体的公平性表现。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要针对性地增强查询表示

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型能更有效地以对象感知方式关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改善交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了具有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: DQEN通过分别增强对象查询和交互查询，显著提升了HOI检测的性能，证明了针对不同组件使用专门增强策略的有效性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了端到端自动驾驶模型的可解释性问题，证明了可解释性与安全性之间的正相关关系，为构建更可信的自动驾驶AI系统提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world

semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia

Conclusion: 该研究为可扩展的行人行为分析提供了初步框架，未来版本将完成所提出度量的定量分析及其在人群动力学研究中的应用

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

TL;DR: USO是一个统一的风格-主体优化定制模型，通过解耦学习和风格奖励学习，在风格相似性和主体保真度两方面都达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显的对抗性。作者认为这两个目标可以在单一框架下统一，因为它们都涉及内容和风格的解耦与重组。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 加入风格奖励学习(SRL)范式；4) 发布USO-Bench联合评估基准

Result: 大量实验表明，USO在开源模型中在主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的生成任务，证明了内容和风格解耦与重组的有效性，为风格化定制生成提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的NeRF视觉定位方法ppNeSF，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保护隐私的同时实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在视觉定位中会编码精细场景细节，存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复。

Method: 提出ppNeRF方法，使用自监督学习的分割标签而非RGB图像进行训练，确保标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时保持3D区分性。

Result: ppNeSF在分割空间中实现了准确的视觉定位，获得了最先进的结果，同时有效保护了隐私。

Conclusion: 通过分割监督训练的NeRF变体能够在保护隐私的前提下实现高质量的视觉定位，为云基定位服务提供了安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

### [153] [Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18984)
*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，通过文本检索和视觉检索两种变体，在多个多页数据集上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，都存在内存消耗大的问题。RAG提供了一种先检索相关片段再生成答案的替代方案。

Method: 采用两种检索变体：基于OCR令牌的文本检索和不依赖OCR的纯视觉检索，在MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA等多页数据集上进行评估。

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升了最多+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体实现了+5.0 ANLS的改进且无需文本提取。检索和重排序组件贡献了大部分增益。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能持续提升多模型尺寸和多页基准测试的准确性，证明了其在真实世界文档VQA中的实用价值。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个评估视觉语言模型人口统计学偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，并提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的广泛使用，理解其人口统计学偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估方法来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，通过多种问题表述方式来评估视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中的偏见，并设计了GRAS偏见评分指标。

Result: 对5个最先进的视觉语言模型进行测试，发现存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分）。

Conclusion: 评估视觉语言模型偏见时需要考虑多种问题表述方式，GRAS基准为系统评估模型偏见提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型在人口统计学偏见方面的严重问题。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，一种基于Transformer的端到端屋顶平面分割方法，通过边缘感知模块和几何约束提升LiDAR点云分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中存在三个问题：非真正端到端、边缘特征判别性低、几何特征考虑不足，需要解决这些问题来提升分割效果

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)整合几何先验；提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失约束训练

Result: 开发了RoofSeg网络，实现了真正的端到端屋顶平面分割，提升了边缘区域的判别能力和分割精度

Conclusion: RoofSeg通过Transformer架构、边缘感知模块和几何约束，有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，实现了更优的分割性能

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MicroDetect-Net模型，结合荧光显微镜、尼罗红染色和深度学习技术，用于检测血液样本中的微塑料，准确率达到92%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球塑料年产量超过3.68亿吨，微塑料污染已广泛存在于空气、水、土壤和生物体中，对人体健康造成潜在危害，需要有效的检测方法

Method: 使用尼罗红染料染色和荧光显微镜技术，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割，构建MicroDetect-Net模型来定位和计数微塑料碎片

Result: 在276张尼罗红染色荧光血液图像数据集上，模型准确率达到92%，IoU为87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精确率90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测方面表现出色，虽然使用蛤血样本存在局限性，但为应用于人类样本提供了可行性，展示了深度学习在环境污染物检测中的潜力

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy模型通过提示金字塔结构和祖先-后代交互机制，对CLIP进行架构适配，在部分相关视频检索任务中实现了最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRVR方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未充分探索

Method: 提出提示金字塔结构组织多粒度事件提示，并构建祖先-后代交互机制实现事件间的动态语义交互

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著超越先前模型

Conclusion: ProPy成功将CLIP适配到PRVR任务，通过多粒度事件语义建模取得了优异效果

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: 通过自监督预训练和基础模型，利用大规模血管几何模型数据集（8449个形状）来改善冠状动脉壳剪刀应力评估，即使在小规模临床试验数据（49名患者）下也能获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据缺乏导致机器学习模型训练困难，特别是在血液动力学标记物评估方面。需要找到方法充分利用大规模几何模型数据集来解决临床数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用热内核签名作为自监督目标，这是通过Laplacian特征向量获得的量，能够捐描形状的本质特征。从大规模血管几何模型数据集中学习几何表征，并应用于冠状动脉壳剪刀应力分割。

Result: 学习到的几何表征能够在有限的数据上显著提升冠状动脉的壳剪刀应力分割效果，将动脉分为低、中、高（时间平均）壳剪刀应力区域。

Conclusion: 通过自监督预训练和基础模型技术，可以充分利用大规模几何模型数据集来解决临床数据稀缺问题，为血液动力学标记物的准确评估提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

TL;DR: SuperSimpleNet是一个高效、自适应的表面缺陷检测模型，能够在四种不同的监督场景（无监督、弱监督、混合监督和全监督）下进行训练，实现快速推理（低于10毫秒）并在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表面缺陷检测方法往往局限于特定的监督场景，难以适应工业制造过程中多样化的数据标注需求，无法同时满足高性能、高效率和强适应性的工业要求。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入了新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，使其能够在所有四种监督场景下进行高效训练，充分利用所有可用的数据标注。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上均达到了新的性能标准，推理时间低于10毫秒，成为首个能够完全利用所有可用数据标注的模型。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化的监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过简单的震动激活和运动补偿，有效解决了事件盘在静态场景中的限制，提高了事件盘的实用性

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的少样本学习方法，通过结合UNet++模型和拓扑感知损失函数，在仅需3个注释页面的情况下实现了历史文档文本行分割的高精度识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而这些数据缺乏且注释成本高。因此需要开发少样本学习方法来降低数据需求和注释成本。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++模型结合拓扑感知损失函数，该损失函数能显式惩罚线条碎片化和意外合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取3个注释页面中提取小片段进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了当前最佳水平：识别准确率提高了200%，行交叉比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛冠军的F-Measure分数。

Conclusion: 该方法在极少注释数据的情况下仍能实现高精度的文本行分割，证明了简单架构结合拓扑感知损失函数在少样本学习中的高效性和优势。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对单目3D视觉定位任务中预训练语言模型对数值单位不敏感的问题，提出了两种简单有效的方法：3D文本增强(3DTE)和文本引导几何增强(TGE)，在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得了11.94%的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同，单位变化也会造成性能严重下降，这表明预训练语言模型在3D理解方面存在缺陷。

Method: 提出3D文本增强(3DTE)方法通过增加距离描述符多样性来增强单位映射关系理解；设计文本引导几何增强(TGE)模块将文本特征投影到几何一致空间，并用增强后的文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比之前方法有显著改进，在"Far"场景中实现了11.94%的准确率提升，达到了新的state-of-the-art水平。

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了预训练语言模型在3D理解方面的局限性，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用的一维位置编码破坏了图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型有效利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的非线性几何特性自然编码空间距离关系，通过代数加法公式直接从绝对编码推导任意补丁对之间的相对位置信息。

Result: 在多个场景下取得优越性能：ViT-Tiny架构在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示相比传统方法具有更强的几何归纳偏置和更连贯的语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE是一种数学原理严谨的方法，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，椭圆函数的双周期特性与视觉数据的平移不变性模式完美对齐，为Vision Transformer提供了更有效的空间位置编码方案。

tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分离生成顶点和面片，减少重复刷新，实现更高效的网格生成，速度提升8倍以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的网格生成方法需要重复使用顶点来表示流形网格，导致令片序列过长和生成效率低下

Method: 1）使用自回归模型生成顶点 2）使用双向Transformer一步完成网格构造 3）引入保真度增强器精细化顶点位置 4）后处理框架清除不良边缘连接

Result: 顶点令片数量降低到现有最优方法的23%，网格生成速度提升8倍以上，同时产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离顶点和面片生成，有效解决了网格生成中的重复性问题，在保持高质量的同时大幅提升了生成效率

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出All-in-One Slider方法，通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，实现单一轻量模块控制多种属性，支持零样本操作和属性组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型在渐进式属性操控方面存在挑战，特别是针对人脸等细节丰富的内容。传统方法需要为每个属性训练独立滑块，导致参数冗余且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 训练轻量级模块将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，形成一个通用滑块，支持细粒度连续控制、零样本操作和属性组合。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了准确且可扩展的属性操控，相比先前方法有显著改进，并能与反演框架结合处理真实图像。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider方法解决了多属性操控的效率和可扩展性问题，为实际应用提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经重建方法的静态环境限制和路径多样性不足，以及图像/视频涵渗模型缺乏几何基础和因果性的问题。

Method: 结合代理几何生成和环境表示，使用从学习到的2D图像先验中的分数蓄粮技术，支持提示引导的几何和高保真纹理生成。

Result: 能够生成高可控性、现实性强、几何一致的复杂驾驶场景3D模型，支持因果新视角合成和显式3D几何估计。

Conclusion: 该方法成功桥接了重建方法和生成方法之间的间隔，为机器人学习提供了高质量的大规模场景数据。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5是一个视频角色动画生成框架，通过多模态大语言模型提供高级语义指导，结合专门的Multimodal DiT架构，生成物理合理且语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频角色模型只能产生物理相似的动作，但缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步。

Method: 1) 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示提供高级语义指导；2) 引入带有Pseudo Last Frame设计的专门Multimodal DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并展现出对多人场景和非人类主体的出色扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够准确理解音频、图像和文本的联合语义，生成与角色、场景和语言内容深度一致的动作，超越了简单的节奏同步，实现了上下文和情感共鸣的动作生成。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或缺乏连续轨迹分解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制，现有方法只能提供静态分析或需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack将手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器集成到粒子跟踪框架中，使用ALIKED检测器和LightGlue匹配器作为最优组合，能够对碳纳米管微柱生长进行运动学分析。

Result: 系统测试使用13,540条手动标注轨迹，ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器组合获得F1分数0.78和α分数0.89，运动矢量可分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，有助于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化中的CNT柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的通用视频分割架构，通过序列化掩码预测统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，在多个基准测试中表现优异且训练速度提升2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频基础模型如SAM2擅长提示式分割，但现实场景需要无提示的全对象检测跟踪，当前解决方案分散且任务特定，需要统一架构

Method: 将流式视频分割重构为序列掩码预测（类似语言建模），基于状态空间模型构建AUSM，维护固定大小空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件支持跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等标准基准测试中超越先前通用流式视频分割方法，16帧序列训练速度提升2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，通过序列化掩码预测和并行训练设计，实现了优异的性能和显著的训练效率提升

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，缺乏标准化的评估基准和协议，需要建立统一的测试标准来推动该领域的发展

Method: 基于4D高斯溅射构建Style4D框架，包含基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（轻量级MLP）和几何保持风格迁移模块，通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持增强时空一致性

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上进行了广泛实验，Style4D实现了最先进的4D风格化性能，能够生成细粒度风格细节并保持稳定的时间动态和多视角一致性

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究的有价值资源，有助于标准化评估和推动该领域进展

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法使用改进的图像生成器创建目标图像，并通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型取得了进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。需要一种能够保持网格原始身份的同时实现自由形式文本提示控制的方法。

Method: 将问题分解为两个步骤：1）修改图像生成器以根据输入图像和文本指令创建目标图像；2）通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐。引入自注意力重布线机制（RSActrl）来解耦源结构和姿态，并使用关键点建立输入和目标图像之间的对应关系。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现出色，能够成功操纵姿态同时保持网格的原始身份。定量评估和比较用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练免费方法，通过语言控制实现3D资产的姿态调整，解决了现有方法在保持身份一致性和姿态控制方面的挑战。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的完整性和整体一致性。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反向轨迹获取潜在表示和键值token，在去噪编辑阶段用反向潜在表示替换保留区域的去噪特征，保持上下文一致性。

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上实验表明，VoxHammer在未编辑区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Motivation: 数据价值评估和数据财务化是现代组织的关键议题，但缺乏标准化案例和框架，需要系统性的指标体系来支持。

Method: 进行系统性文献综述，收集分析了657个指标和KPI，并采用平衡记分卡(BSC)方法构建了一个大型分类系统，包含组织各个方面的业务。

Result: 研究提供了一个包含657个指标的全面分类系统，来自162份参考文献，覆盖了组织各业务领域和各类利益相关者的需求。

Conclusion: 这个分类法有助于组织各级别的数据管理人员理解数据价值评估和财务化的复杂性，同时也讨论了建立标准框架的困难和领域面临的主要挑战。

Abstract: Data valuation and data monetisation are complex subjects but essential to
most organisations today. Unfortunately, they still lack standard procedures
and frameworks for organisations to follow. In this survey, we introduce the
reader to the concepts by providing the definitions and the background required
to better understand data, monetisation strategies, and finally metrics and
KPIs used in these strategies. We have conducted a systematic literature review
on metrics and KPIs used in data valuation and monetisation, in every aspect of
an organisation's business, and by a variety of stakeholders. We provide an
expansive list of such metrics and KPIs with 162 references. We then categorise
all the metrics and KPIs found into a large taxonomy, following the Balanced
Scorecard (BSC) approach with further subclustering to cover every aspect of an
organisation's business. This taxonomy will help every level of data management
understand the complex landscape of the domain. We also discuss the difficulty
in creating a standard framework for data valuation and data monetisation and
the major challenges the domain is currently facing.

TL;DR: DiskJoin是一个基于磁盘的相似性连接算法，在单机上高效处理十亿级向量数据集，通过优化数据访问模式和缓存管理实现50-1000倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式计算方法需要集群部署且通信成本高，而基于磁盘的解决方案虽然成本效益更好但存在磁盘I/O瓶颈问题

Method: 通过定制数据访问模式避免重复访问和读取放大，使用主内存作为动态缓存并精心管理缓存淘汰策略，采用概率剪枝技术有效减少计算量

Result: 在真实世界大规模数据集上的评估显示，DiskJoin显著优于替代方案，实现了50倍到1000倍的加速

Conclusion: DiskJoin是第一个能够在单机上高效处理十亿级向量数据集的基于磁盘的相似性连接算法，有效解决了磁盘I/O瓶颈问题

Abstract: Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of
items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored
distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes
but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from
expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions
are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset
on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods
the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin,
the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale
vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by
tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read
amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully
manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval
time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that
can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our
evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin
significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Brook-2PL是一种新颖的两阶段锁定协议，通过SLW-Graph实现无死锁事务执行，并通过部分事务切分实现早期锁释放，在高竞争工作负载中显著优于现有并发控制协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并发控制在高度竞争工作负载中面临热点问题，导致过多事务中止和死锁，造成工作浪费和系统负担。

Method: 提出SLW-Graph依赖结构实现无死锁两阶段锁定，采用部分事务切分实现早期锁释放，通过静态事务分析提供更灵活的切分方法。

Result: 在TPC-C基准测试中平均加速2.86倍，尾部延迟(p95)降低48%，在合成在线游戏商店工作负载中也表现优异。

Conclusion: Brook-2PL有效解决了高竞争工作负载中的热点问题，显著提升了并发控制性能，减少了事务中止和死锁。

Abstract: The problem of hotspots remains a critical challenge in high-contention
workloads for concurrency control (CC) protocols. Traditional concurrency
control approaches encounter significant difficulties under high contention,
resulting in excessive transaction aborts and deadlocks. In this paper, we
propose Brook-2PL, a novel two-phase locking (2PL) protocol that (1) introduces
SLW-Graph for deadlock-free transaction execution, and (2) proposes partial
transaction chopping for early lock release. Previous methods suffer from
transaction aborts that lead to wasted work and can further burden the system
due to their cascading effects. Brook-2PL addresses this limitation by
statically analyzing a new graph-based dependency structure called SLW-Graph,
enabling deadlock-free two-phase locking through predetermined lock
acquisition. Brook-2PL also reduces contention by enabling early lock release
using partial transaction chopping and static transaction analysis. We overcome
the inherent limitations of traditional transaction chopping by providing a
more flexible chopping method. Evaluation using both our synthetic online game
store workload and the TPC-C benchmark shows that Brook-2PL significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art CC protocols. Brook-2PL achieves an average
speed-up of 2.86x while reducing tail latency (p95) by 48% in the TPC-C
benchmark.

*Yalong Zhang,Rong-Hua Li,Qi Zhang,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了BD-Index索引结构，用于在二分图中高效查询(α, β)-稠密子图，支持最优时间查询和线性空间使用，并提供两种动态更新策略以适应不同应用需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的(α, β)-稠密子图模型虽然在建模二分图密度结构方面表现出色，但缺乏高效的查询处理和动态更新支持，限制了其在大规模应用中的实用性。

Method: 设计BD-Index索引结构，使用线性空间O(|E|)实现最优时间查询；开发两种维护策略：空间高效策略(O(p·|E|^{1.5})更新时间)和时间高效策略(O(p·|E|)更新时间，但需要额外内存)。

Result: 在10个大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，所提解决方案具有高效率和良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: BD-Index填补了(α, β)-稠密子图模型在查询效率和动态更新方面的空白，为二分图分析提供了实用的解决方案，两种维护策略提供了灵活的性能权衡。

Abstract: Dense subgraph search in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem in graph
analysis, with wide-ranging applications in fraud detection, recommendation
systems, and social network analysis. The recently proposed $(\alpha,
\beta)$-dense subgraph model has demonstrated superior capability in capturing
the intrinsic density structure of bipartite graphs compared to existing
alternatives. However, despite its modeling advantages, the $(\alpha,
\beta)$-dense subgraph model lacks efficient support for query processing and
dynamic updates, limiting its practical utility in large-scale applications. To
address these limitations, we propose BD-Index, a novel index that answers
$(\alpha, \beta)$-dense subgraph queries in optimal time while using only
linear space $O(|E|)$, making it well-suited for real-world applications
requiring both fast query processing and low memory consumption. We further
develop two complementary maintenance strategies for dynamic bipartite graphs
to support efficient updates to the BD-Index. The space-efficient strategy
updates the index in time complexity of $O(p \cdot |E|^{1.5})$ per edge
insertion or deletion, while maintaining a low space cost of $O(|E|)$ (the same
as the index itself), where $p$ is typically a small constant in real-world
graphs. In contrast, the time-efficient strategy significantly reduces the
update time to $O(p \cdot |E|)$ per edge update by maintaining auxiliary
orientation structures, at the cost of increased memory usage up to $O(p \cdot
|E|)$. These two strategies provide flexible trade-offs between maintenance
efficiency and memory usage, enabling BD-Index to adapt to diverse application
requirements. Extensive experiments on 10 large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate high efficiency and scalability of our proposed solutions.

TL;DR: 窗口图基于的RFANNS索引，支持增量构建和任意范围筛选，在查询性能和构建效率方面都表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RFANNS索引在增量构建和任意范围筛选方面的挑战，提高查询性能和通用性

Method: 提出基于窗口图的RFANNS索引，通过分层窗口图与变化窗口大小的插入算法支持增量构建，利用范围选择性优化窗口搜索

Result: 在实际数据集上，构建时间与最高效索引相当，比最查询高效索引快4.9倍，索引大小减少40-50%；查询速度比最高效增量索引快4倍，性能可与静态构建的最佳索引相比

Conclusion: 窗口图索引在RFANNS问题中实现了高效的增量构建和任意范围筛选，在构建效率、索引大小和查询性能方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: Given a hybrid dataset where every data object consists of a vector and an
attribute value, for each query with a target vector and a range filter,
range-filtering approximate nearest neighbor search (RFANNS) aims to retrieve
the most similar vectors from the dataset and the corresponding attribute
values fall in the query range. It is a fundamental function in vector database
management systems and intelligent systems with embedding abilities. Dedicated
indices for RFANNS accelerate query speed with an acceptable accuracy loss on
nearest neighbors. However, they are still facing the challenges to be
constructed incrementally and generalized to achieve superior query performance
for arbitrary range filters. In this paper, we introduce a window graph-based
RFANNS index. For incremental construction, we propose an insertion algorithm
to add new vector-attribute pairs into hierarchical window graphs with varying
window size. To handle arbitrary range filters, we optimize relevant window
search for attribute filter checks and vector distance computations by range
selectivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that for index
construction, the indexing time is on par with the most building-efficient
index, and 4.9x faster than the most query-efficient index with 0.4-0.5x
smaller size; For RFANNS query, it is 4x faster than the most efficient
incremental index, and matches the performance of the best statically-built
index.

Motivation: 传统缓存策略无法满足大语言模型服务的严格SLO要求，精确匹配和前缀缓存忽略了查询语义，而现有语义缓存缺乏概念创新。

Method: SISO采用基于质心的缓存最大化内存覆盖，局部感知替换保留高价值条目，动态阈值平衡不同工作负载下的准确性和延迟。

Result: 在多样化数据集上，SISO相比最先进系统实现了1.71倍的命中率提升，并持续提供更强的SLO达成能力。

Conclusion: SISO系统重新定义了LLM服务效率，通过创新的语义缓存方法有效解决了计算和内存约束下的服务性能问题。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment
compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Motivation: 解决大规模表格数据集查询和分析的挑战，特别是为非编程专家用户提供更高效和灵活的数据分析方案，克服SQL在处理大数据集和复杂分析时的局限性

Method: 使用LLM迭代解释自然语言查询并构建操作序列，在传统数据库外实现查询计划执行，支持SQL命令同时避免SQL限制，直接对数据执行操作而不需要模型处理整个数据集

Result: 在标准数据库和大型科学表格上的实验验证了框架的有效性，能够处理大规模数据集并执行复杂数据分析

Conclusion: 该框架提供了比传统SQL更灵活和可扩展的数据分析能力，成功解决了大规模数据查询和复杂分析的挑战

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在对象中心事件日志中嵌入分析师定义过程范围的方法，解决现有格式缺乏明确过程定义的问题，支持多过程分析和不同粒度层面的聚合分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对象中心事件数据格式缺乏明确的过程范围定义，限制了对单个过程的分析和低粒度层面的洞察。实践中OCED常跨越多个相互关联的过程，但过程边界定义主观且上下文依赖，无法自动发现。

Method: 提出一种方法，将分析师定义的过程范围嵌入到OCEL格式中，支持多个共存过程的结构化表示，过程范围间的事件数据聚合，以及不同抽象层面的分析。

Result: 使用公开可用的OCEL日志展示了方法的可用性，并提供了支持范围定义和分析的工具。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了对象中心过程挖掘中过程范围定义不明确的问题，支持更灵活的多过程分析和多粒度层面的分析需求。

Abstract: Object-Centric Process Mining enables the analysis of complex operational
behavior by capturing interactions among multiple business objects (e.g.,
orders, items, deliveries). These interactions are recorded using
Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) formats, such as the Object-Centric Event Log
(OCEL). However, existing formats lack explicit definitions of process scopes,
which restricts analysis to individual processes and limits insights to a low
level of granularity. In practice, OCED often spans multiple interrelated
processes, as shared objects connect events across organizational functions.
This structure reflects how value is created along the organizational value
chain, but introduces challenges for interpretation when process boundaries are
not clearly defined. Moreover, process definitions are typically subjective and
context-dependent; they vary across organizations, roles, and analytical goals,
and cannot always be discovered automatically. To address these challenges, we
propose a method for embedding analyst-defined process scopes into OCEL. This
enables the structured representation of multiple coexisting processes,
supports the aggregation of event data across scopes, and facilitates analysis
at varying levels of abstraction. We demonstrate the applicability of our
approach using a publicly available OCEL log and provide supporting tools for
scope definition and analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型驱动的代理人在科学工作流程中遇到异构API和安全模垅障碍，需要一种统一接口来使科研能力可发现、可调用和可组合。

Method: 采用模型上下文协议(MCP)作为统一接口，在成熟服务(如Globus传输、计算、搜索等)上实现薄层MCP服务器，并通过计算化学、生物信息学等案例研究进行实践验证。

Result: 建立了一种MCP导向的架构，使得科研能力能够被代理人发现、调用和组合，为代理人导向的科学提供了实践基础。

Conclusion: MCP协议可以有效解决科研设施中的异构API问题，但仍面临评估和信任方面的挑战，需要进一步研究代理人领导的科学工作流程。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used to plan and
execute scientific workflows, yet most research cyberinfrastructure (CI)
exposes heterogeneous APIs and implements security models that present barriers
for use by agents. We report on our experience using the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) as a unifying interface that makes research capabilities discoverable,
invokable, and composable. Our approach is pragmatic: we implement thin MCP
servers over mature services, including Globus Transfer, Compute, and Search;
status APIs exposed by computing facilities; Octopus event fabric; and
domain-specific tools such as Garden and Galaxy. We use case studies in
computational chemistry, bioinformatics, quantum chemistry, and filesystem
monitoring to illustrate how this MCP-oriented architecture can be used in
practice. We distill lessons learned and outline open challenges in evaluation
and trust for agent-led science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU虽然支持并发和安全隔离，但由于芯片分区约束复杂，充分利用其并发性具有挑战性。需要开发有效的分区调度方案来提升性能。

Method: 开发了包含动态内存估计、分区融合、分区分裂的分区调度方案，支持进程重启以处理内存不足错误，并采用早期重启优化。

Result: 通用工作负载获得6.20倍吞吐量和5.93倍能效提升；机器学习工作负载在A100上获得1.59倍吞吐量和1.12倍能效提升；LLM工作负载获得1.43倍吞吐量和1.11倍能效提升。

Conclusion: 提出的分区调度方案能有效利用现代GPU的并发能力，显著提升各类工作负载的性能和能效，特别是在处理内存密集型任务时表现优异。

Abstract: Modern GPUs such as the Ampere series (A30, A100) as well as the Hopper
series (H100, H200) offer performance as well as security isolation features.
They also support a good amount of concurrency, but taking advantage of it can
be quite challenging due to the complex constraints on partitioning the chip.
  In this work, we develop partitioning and scheduling schemes for a variety of
workloads, ranging from scientific to modern ML workloads, including LLMs. We
develop several schemes involving dynamic memory estimation, partition fusion
and partition fission. We also support process restart to recover from
out-of-memory errors for workloads and early restart as an optimization. This
approach yields up to 6.20x throughput and 5.93x energy improvements for
general workloads; and we see 1.59x and 1.12x improvement to throughput and
energy, respectively, for ML workloads on an A100 GPU. We leverage this
technique on LLM workloads and show good improvements, including up to 1.43x
throughput improvement and 1.11x energy savings.

TL;DR: Strata是一个分层上下文缓存框架，通过GPU辅助I/O和缓存感知调度，解决了长上下文LLM服务中的KV缓存碎片化和I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口的扩展，KV缓存存储需求超过GPU内存容量，导致分层缓存中I/O性能瓶颈和调度效率低下，系统从计算密集型变为加载密集型。

Method: Strata采用GPU辅助I/O技术解决KV缓存碎片化问题，解耦GPU和CPU内存布局，并使用缓存感知请求调度来平衡计算与I/O延迟，将不可避免的停顿与补充任务重叠执行。

Result: 在生产环境中部署的Strata相比vLLM + LMCache实现了5倍的首token时间降低，相比NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM在长上下文基准测试中获得3.75倍加速，且不影响短上下文性能。

Conclusion: Strata框架有效解决了长上下文LLM服务中的缓存管理和I/O性能问题，显著提升了系统整体性能，为生产环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanding context windows face significant
performance hurdles. While caching key-value (KV) states is critical for
avoiding redundant computation, the storage footprint of long-context caches
quickly exceeds GPU memory capacity, forcing production systems to adopt
hierarchical caching across memory hierarchies. However, transferring large
cached contexts back to the GPU introduces severe performance bottlenecks:
fragmented I/O from paged layouts prevents full bandwidth utilization, and
existing schedulers fail to account for cache-loading delays, leaving systems
loading-bound rather than compute-bound. We present Strata, a hierarchical
context caching framework designed for efficient long context LLM serving.
Strata introduces GPU-assisted I/O to combat KV cache fragmentation, decoupling
GPU and CPU memory layouts and employs cache-aware request scheduling to
balance compute with I/O latency and overlapping unavoidable stalls with
complementary tasks. Built on SGLang and deployed in production, Strata
achieves up to 5x lower Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to vLLM + LMCache
and 3.75x speedup over NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM on long-context benchmarks, without
degrading short-context performance.

TL;DR: 评估MPI的VCI和Continuation扩展在AMT系统HPX中的性能表现，发现虽然能提升性能但仍需改进，特别是在多VCI设置下的多线程消息速率和单VCI每线程模式的有效性方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPC架构复杂化和不规则科学算法的普及需要高效的异步多线程通信支持，而原始MPI规范未考虑这种通信模式，需要评估新的MPI扩展在AMT系统中的有效性。

Method: 使用基于HPX低级通信机制的MPI级微基准测试测量扩展的峰值性能潜力，然后将这些扩展集成到HPX中以评估实际场景中的效果。

Result: 扩展相比标准MPI能提升性能，但当前continuation提案限制了多VCI设置中的最大多线程消息速率，且推荐的单VCI每线程模式因注意力问题在实际系统中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 需要提高VCI内部线程效率以实现可扩展的多线程通信，并充分发挥近期MPI扩展的效益。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of HPC architectures and the growing adoption of
irregular scientific algorithms demand efficient support for asynchronous,
multithreaded communication. This need is especially pronounced with
Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems. This communication pattern was not a
consideration during the design of the original MPI specification. The MPI
community has recently introduced several extensions to address these evolving
requirements. This work evaluates two such extensions, the Virtual
Communication Interface (VCI) and the Continuation extensions, in the context
of an established AMT runtime HPX. We begin by using an MPI-level
microbenchmark, modeled from HPX's low-level communication mechanism, to
measure the peak performance potential of these extensions. We then integrate
them into HPX to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our
results show that while these extensions can enhance performance compared to
standard MPI, areas for improvement remain. The current continuation proposal
limits the maximum multithreaded message rate achievable in the multi-VCI
setting. Furthermore, the recommended one-VCI-per-thread mode proves
ineffective in real-world systems due to the attentiveness problem. These
findings underscore the importance of improving intra-VCI threading efficiency
to achieve scalable multithreaded communication and fully realize the benefits
of recent MPI extensions.

Motivation: 大语言模型解码存在高延迟问题，原因是算子执行碎片化和依赖牌外内存进行数据交换与约简，导致内存交通和内核启动开销较大

Method: 提出两种集群级通信原语ClusterReduce和ClusterGather，并基于此设计ClusterFusion执行框架，通过联合调度通信与计算，将QKV投影、注意力和输出投影等解码阶段组合成单个融合内核

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估显示，ClusterFusion在不同模型和配置下的终端到终端延迟性能超过最先进的推理框架，平均提升1.61倍

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出结构化的集群通信原语和融合执行框架，有效解决了LLM解码的延迟问题，为深度学习系统提供了高效的计算方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

Motivation: HPC系统需要应用特定的洞察来分析日益复杂和多样化的工作负载，但传统的基于作业名或文件名的识别方法不可靠，特别是对于用户自定义的任意文件名。

Method: SIREN框架收集进程元数据、环境信息和可执行文件的模糊哈希，使用模糊哈希技术检测可执行文件的相似性，即使版本或编译方式发生变化也能保持识别能力。

Conclusion: SIREN通过模糊哈希技术提高了HPC系统的可观测性，为系统优化和安全改进提供了有效的数据分析能力。

Abstract: HPC systems use monitoring and operational data analytics to ensure
efficiency, performance, and orderly operations. Application-specific insights
are crucial for analyzing the increasing complexity and diversity of HPC
workloads, particularly through the identification of unknown software and
recognition of repeated executions, which facilitate system optimization and
security improvements. However, traditional identification methods using job or
file names are unreliable for arbitrary user-provided names (a.out). Fuzzy
hashing of executables detects similarities despite changes in executable
version or compilation approach while preserving privacy and file integrity,
overcoming these limitations. We introduce SIREN, a process-level data
collection framework for software identification and recognition. SIREN
improves observability in HPC by enabling analysis of process metadata,
environment information, and executable fuzzy hashes. Findings from a first
opt-in deployment campaign on LUMI show SIREN's ability to provide insights
into software usage, recognition of repeated executions of known applications,
and similarity-based identification of unknown applications.

Abstract: For decades, supercritical flame simulations incorporating detailed chemistry
and real-fluid transport have been limited to millions of cells, constraining
the resolved spatial and temporal scales of the physical system. We optimize
the supercritical flame simulation software DeepFlame -- which incorporates
deep neural networks while retaining the real-fluid mechanical and chemical
accuracy -- from three perspectives: parallel computing, computational
efficiency, and I/O performance. Our highly optimized DeepFlame achieves
supercritical liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/\ce{CH4}) turbulent combustion
simulation of up to 618 and 154 billion cells with unprecedented
time-to-solution, attaining 439/1186 and 187/316 PFlop/s (32.3\%/21.8\% and

computational capability surpasses existing capacities by three orders of
magnitude, enabling the first practical simulation of rocket engine combustion
with >100 LOX/\ce{CH4} injectors. This breakthrough establishes high-fidelity
supercritical flame modeling as a critical design tool for next-generation

TL;DR: CARMA是一个服务器级别的任务协同定位感知资源管理系统，通过ML内存估计和干扰控制策略解决GPU协同定位中的内存崩溃和性能干扰问题，显著提升GPU利用率并降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级基础设施中GPU资源利用率低下，深度学习训练任务协同定位虽能提高利用率，但会导致内存溢出崩溃和资源干扰导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出CARMA系统，包含GPUMemNet（基于ML的GPU内存估计框架）来最小化内存错误，引入协同定位策略限制GPU利用率以减少干扰，并提供任务崩溃后的恢复机制。

Result: 在模拟真实世界DL训练任务轨迹的评估中，CARMA使GPU时间利用率提升39.3%，端到端执行时间减少约26.7%，GPU能耗降低约14.2%。

Conclusion: CARMA系统有效解决了GPU协同定位的关键挑战，在提高资源利用率的同时保证了服务质量和能源效率，为大规模深度学习训练提供了可靠的资源管理解决方案。

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU
due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to
robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our
evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows
that CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\%, decreases the
end-to-end execution time by $\sim$26.7\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by
$\sim$14.2\%.

TL;DR: FLUX是一个联邦学习系统，专门用于在资源受限设备上高效微调MoE大语言模型，通过量化分析、专家合并和动态角色分配实现4.75倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法在资源受限环境下有效微调MoE大语言模型，存在不切实际的系统假设和缺乏对MoE特性的考虑

Method: 提出三个关键技术：1)基于量化的本地分析估计专家激活；2)自适应层感知专家合并减少资源消耗；3)探索-利用策略动态分配专家角色

Result: 在LLaMA-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE上的实验显示，相比现有方法实现高达4.75倍的时间-精度加速

Conclusion: FLUX系统成功解决了资源受限环境下MoE模型联邦微调的挑战，显著提升了效率同时保持精度

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models
(LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the
resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this
gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning.
However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system
assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In
this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning
of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources
(e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX
introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to
estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware
expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and
(3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy
to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE
and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in
time-to-accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着纳米电子器件尺寸缩小至几纳米，电子被限制在超小体积中，产生强电子-电子相互作用，需要扩展DFT+NEGF求解器以包含GW近似来准确描述这些关键效应。

Method: 实现了NEGF+GW方案，开发了QuaTrEx软件包，采用新颖的空间域分解方案，能够在Alps和Frontier超级计算机上高效运行。

Result: 能够处理84,480个原子的NRFET器件，在42,240个原子时达到1.15 Eflop/s的exascale FP64性能，弱扩展效率超过80%。

Conclusion: QuaTrEx是首个能够处理实验尺度NRFET器件的NEGF+GW实现，为纳米电子器件的精确量子力学建模提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Designing nanoscale electronic devices such as the currently manufactured
nanoribbon field-effect transistors (NRFETs) requires advanced modeling tools
capturing all relevant quantum mechanical effects. State-of-the-art approaches
combine the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism and density
functional theory (DFT). However, as device dimensions do not exceed a few
nanometers anymore, electrons are confined in ultra-small volumes, giving rise
to strong electron-electron interactions. To account for these critical
effects, DFT+NEGF solvers should be extended with the GW approximation, which
massively increases their computational intensity. Here, we present the first
implementation of the NEGF+GW scheme capable of handling NRFET geometries with
dimensions comparable to experiments. This package, called QuaTrEx, makes use
of a novel spatial domain decomposition scheme, can treat devices made of up to
84,480 atoms, scales very well on the Alps and Frontier supercomputers (>80%
weak scaling efficiency), and sustains an exascale FP64 performance on 42,240
atoms (1.15 Eflop/s).

Motivation: 6G物联网设备资源有限，现有管理策略缺乏实时操作能力，难以满足低延迟和能效要求，需要新的解决方案来同时优化延迟和能耗。

Method: 构建数字孪生引导的能源管理框架，采用分布式覆盖网络提供孪生模型，通过RTPS协议处理数据层与上层动态更新。设计强化学习引擎，使用新颖的奖励函数和DDPG算法输出连续动作，为每个IoT设备提供最优数据更新时间。

Abstract: Although the emergence of 6G IoT networks has accelerated the deployment of
enhanced smart city services, the resource limitations of IoT devices remain as
a significant problem. Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service
requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G
IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete
actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address
these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management
framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in
6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a
distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data
layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe
(RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a
novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each
of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states
from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to
output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results,
we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th
percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the
existing literature.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to
extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the
sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy
multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we
propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks,
where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible
for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory
of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem
(MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as
well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer
nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and
Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to
establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated
sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal
solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted
to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline
mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks and the
Internet of Things (IoT) has catalyzed the evolution from centralized cloud
intelligence towards decentralized edge general intelligence. However,
traditional edge intelligence methods, characterized by static models and
limited cognitive autonomy, fail to address the dynamic, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained scenarios inherent to emerging edge networks. Agentic
artificial intelligence (Agentic AI) emerges as a transformative solution,
enabling edge systems to autonomously perceive multimodal environments, reason
contextually, and adapt proactively through continuous
perception-reasoning-action loops. In this context, the agentification of edge
intelligence serves as a key paradigm shift, where distributed entities evolve
into autonomous agents capable of collaboration and continual adaptation. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey dedicated to Agentic AI and
agentification frameworks tailored explicitly for edge general intelligence.
First, we systematically introduce foundational concepts and clarify
distinctions from traditional edge intelligence paradigms. Second, we analyze
important enabling technologies, including compact model compression,
energy-aware computing strategies, robust connectivity frameworks, and advanced
knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms. Third, we provide
representative case studies demonstrating Agentic AI's capabilities in
low-altitude economy networks, intent-driven networking, vehicular networks,
and human-centric service provisioning, supported by numerical evaluations.
Furthermore, we identify current research challenges, review emerging
open-source platforms, and highlight promising future research directions to
guide robust, scalable, and trustworthy Agentic AI deployments for
next-generation edge environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart cities,
transportation, healthcare, and industrial applications, coupled with the
explosive growth of AI-driven services, has increased demands for efficient
distributed computing architectures and networks, driving cloud-edge-terminal
collaborative intelligence (CETCI) as a fundamental paradigm within the

paradigms that cover task offloading, resource allocation, and optimization
across heterogeneous infrastructures. Furthermore, we explain intelligent

distributed deep learning, edge-cloud model evolution, and reinforcement
learning-based methods. Finally, we discuss challenges (e.g., scalability,
heterogeneity, interoperability) and future trends (e.g., 6G+, agents, quantum

Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards that enables the
industry to provide real-time guarantees for time-critical communications with
Ethernet hardware. TSN supports various queuing and scheduling mechanisms and
allows the integration of multiple traffic types in a single network. Network
Calculus (NC) can be used to calculate upper bounds for latencies and buffer
sizes within these networks, for example, for safety or real-time traffic. We
explain the relevance of NC for TSN-based computer communications and potential
areas of application. Different NC analysis approaches have been published to
examine different parts of TSN and this paper provides a survey of these
publications and presents their main results, dependencies, and differences. We
present a consistent presentation of the most important results and suggest an
improvement to model the output of sending end-devices. To ease access to the
current research status, we introduce a common notation to show how all results
depend on each other and also identify common assumptions. Thus, we offer a
comprehensive overview of NC for industrial networks and identify possible
areas for future work.

Conclusion: 挑战传统的刚性通信延迟目标，建议采用考虑计算和传输开销的应用特定端到端延迟预算。

Abstract: With the advent of edge computing, data generated by end devices can be
pre-processed before transmission, possibly saving transmission time and
energy. On the other hand, data processing itself incurs latency and energy
consumption, depending on the complexity of the computing operations and the
speed of the processor. The energy-latency-reliability profile resulting from
the concatenation of pre-processing operations (specifically, data compression)
and data transmission is particularly relevant in wireless communication
services, whose requirements may change dramatically with the application
domain. In this paper, we study this multi-dimensional optimization problem,
introducing a simple model to investigate the tradeoff among end-to-end
latency, reliability, and energy consumption when considering compression and
communication operations in a constrained wireless device. We then study the
Pareto fronts of the energy-latency trade-off, considering data compression
ratio and device processing speed as key design variables. Our results show
that the energy costs grows exponentially with the reduction of the end-to-end
latency, so that considerable energy saving can be obtained by slightly
relaxing the latency requirements of applications. These findings challenge
conventional rigid communication latency targets, advocating instead for
application-specific end-to-end latency budgets that account for computational
and transmission overhead.

Abstract: To support reliable and low-latency communication, Time-Sensitive Networking
introduced protocols and interfaces for resource allocation in Ethernet.
However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been
covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource
allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we
combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control
and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We
demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay
analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive
and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements,
both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can
guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the
network while requiring only minimal user input.

and the DSM is ensured by the self-organizing KIRA routing protocol. The
demonstrated system enables scalable, zero-touch connectivity and supports
nomadic SNs through seamless discovery and reconfiguration. SNs are implemented
for modular Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, as well as for
mission-critical control loops and for logistics or nomadic behavior. The DSM
framework dynamically adapts spectrum allocation to meet real-time demands
while ensuring reliable operation. The demonstration highlights the potential
of DSM and NiNs to support flexible, dense, and heterogeneous wireless

Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks consist of thousands of satellites
orbiting the Earth, enabling low-latency and high-throughput communications
across the globe. Such networks present unprecedented challenges due to their
dynamic nature, which state-of-the-art data transport protocols do not address.
These challenges include: (1) non-congestive latency variation and loss, caused
by continuous satellite movement and fluctuating link quality due to weather
effects; (2) transient hotspots leading to buffer build-up, latency inflation,
and potential packet loss; and (3) frequent handovers, which may result in
temporary connectivity loss and re-routing through paths with unknown
congestion and delay characteristics. In this paper, we introduce LeoTCP, a
novel data transport protocol designed specifically to address these
challenges. LeoTCP leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to gather congestion
information on a per-hop basis. Using this information, LeoTCP (1) minimises
both buffer occupancy and latency for end users, (2) maximises application
throughput and network utilisation, and (3) swiftly reacts to network hotspots.
We compare LeoTCP to state-of-the-art data transport protocols using a LEO
satellite simulation model and targeted micro-benchmarks, both based on
OMNeT++/INET. The simulation model captures RTT dynamics in a simulated LEO
satellite constellation, while the micro-benchmarks isolate key LEO-specific
characteristics, including non-congestive latency variation and loss, path
changes, and congestion hotspots. Our results demonstrate that LeoTCP
significantly increases goodput compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches, while simultaneously minimising latency.

energy savings, up to $35\%$, while maintaining quality of service.
Furthermore, our results allow us to characterizing how the benefits of network
sharing vary as a function of the geographical and functional characteristics

TL;DR: 本文提出了面向目标的多址接入(GoMA)理论框架，解决了多智能体在无线信道中协调共享和避免干扰的问题，证明了问题的非凸性和多纳什均衡存在性，并设计了分布式学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面向目标通信研究主要集中在点对点场景，多节点分布式场景几乎未被探索。现有研究采用集中式无冲突方法，而本文旨在解决分布式环境中多个智能体协调共享无线信道的问题。

Result: 提出的优化方法能够达到纳什均衡，性能比集中式方法提升高达100%，同时降低了能耗。分布式学习算法在有限反馈条件下表现良好。

Conclusion: 本文为分布式面向目标多址接入提供了首个理论框架和分析方法，证明了分布式方法相比集中式方法的显著优势，为未来完全表征该问题奠定了基础。

Abstract: The Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) paradigm breaks the separation between
communication and the content of the data, tailoring communication decisions to
the specific needs of the receiver and targeting application performance. While
recent studies show impressive encoding performance in point-to-point
scenarios, the multi-node distributed scenario is still almost unexplored.
Moreover, the few studies to investigate this consider a centralized
collision-free approach, where a central scheduler decides the transmission
order of the nodes. In this work, we address the Goal-oriented Multiple Access
(GoMA) problem, in which multiple intelligent agents must coordinate to share a
wireless channel and avoid mutual interference. We propose a theoretical
framework for the analysis and optimization of distributed GoMA, serving as a
first step towards its complete characterization. We prove that the problem is
non-convex and may admit multiple Nash Equilibrium (NE) solutions. We provide a
characterization of each node's best response to others' strategies and propose
an optimization approach that provably reaches one such NE, outperforming
centralized approaches by up to 100% while also reducing energy consumption. We
also design a distributed learning algorithm that operates with limited
feedback and no prior knowledge.

### [204] [A Case Study on the Effectiveness of LLMs in Verification with Proof Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18587)
*Barış Bayazıt,Yao Li,Xujie Si*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在证明助手验证任务中的有效性，通过Rocq项目的案例研究发现LLMs在小证明上表现良好但存在差异性和错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有潜力通过自动化证明来辅助证明助手进行验证，但其在此任务中的实际效果尚不明确

Method: 基于两个成熟的Rocq项目（hs-to-coq工具和Verdi）进行案例研究，通过定量和定性分析评估LLMs生成证明的有效性

Result: 研究发现：(1)外部依赖和同源文件上下文显著帮助证明生成；(2)LLMs在小证明上表现优异但也能生成大型证明；(3)在不同验证项目上表现不同；(4)能生成简洁智能证明但也会犯奇怪错误

Conclusion: LLMs在证明生成方面具有潜力，特别是在小证明和适当上下文支持下，但性能表现存在项目差异性且可能产生错误，需要进一步研究改进

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can potentially help with verification using
proof assistants by automating proofs. However, it is unclear how effective
LLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two
mature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the
same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform
great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform
differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate
concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but
can also make odd mistakes.

*Terry Yue Zhuo,Dingmin Wang,Hantian Ding,Varun Kumar,Zijian Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了CTF-Dojo，第一个大规模可执行运行时环境，用于训练具有可验证反馈的大语言模型，包含658个完全功能的CTF挑战，在仅使用486个高质量执行验证轨迹训练后，在多个基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可扩展和通用的执行基础环境稀缺，限制了训练更强大机器学习代理的进展，需要开发能够提供可验证反馈的大规模可执行环境。

Method: 开发了CTF-Dojo执行环境，包含658个Docker容器化的CTF挑战；创建了CTF-Forge自动化流水线，能够快速将公开可用工件转换为即用型执行环境；使用执行验证的轨迹训练LLM代理。

Result: 在仅使用486个高质量轨迹训练后，在InterCode-CTF、NYU CTF Bench和Cybench三个基准测试中取得了最高11.6%的绝对性能提升；最佳32B模型达到31.9% Pass@1，创造了新的开源权重最先进水平，媲美前沿模型。

Conclusion: CTF-Dojo证明了执行基础训练信号不仅有效，而且是推进高性能机器学习代理发展的关键，无需依赖昂贵的专有系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM与人类程序员在代码理解上是否存在相似的困惑模式，以指导LLM在软件工程工作流中的集成和改进

Method: 通过比较LLM困惑度和人类神经生理反应（EEG固定相关电位），分析清洁代码和混淆代码的理解差异

Result: 发现LLM困惑度峰值在位置和幅度上都与人类困惑的神经生理反应相关

Conclusion: LLM和人类对代码的困惑模式相似，基于此可开发数据驱动的LLM方法来识别人类程序员的代码困惑区域

Abstract: Already today, humans and programming assistants based on large language
models (LLMs) collaborate in everyday programming tasks. Clearly, a
misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to
misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs.
  A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the
same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in
software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of
LLMs.
  To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human
programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized
comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers
using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related
potentials).
  We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and
amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This
result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code.
Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to
identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human
programmers.

*Yan Wang,Xinyi Hou,Yanjie Zhao,Weiguo Lin,Haoyu Wang,Junjun Si*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LaQual是一个自动化评估LLM应用质量的框架，通过分层分类、静态指标筛选和动态场景自适应评估三阶段方法，能有效识别高质量应用并显著提升用户选择效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用商店主要依赖用户活跃度和收藏等静态指标进行排名推荐，难以帮助用户高效找到高质量应用，需要更科学的评估方法。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 分层分类LLM应用以匹配不同场景；2) 使用时加权用户参与度和功能能力指标等静态指标筛选低质量应用；3) 进行动态场景自适应评估，由LLM生成场景特定的评估指标、评分规则和任务。

Result: 实验显示LaQual自动化评分与人工判断高度一致（法律咨询Spearman's rho=0.62，旅行规划rho=0.60），能减少66.7%-81.3%的候选应用，用户研究显示在决策信心、比较效率（5.45 vs 3.30）和评估报告价值感知（4.75 vs 2.25）方面显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: LaQual提供了一个可扩展、客观且以用户为中心的解决方案，能在实际使用场景中有效发现和推荐高质量的LLM应用。

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

TL;DR: 提出了ReDeFo多智能体框架，通过需求开发和形式化方法实现可靠的代码生成，使用形式化规范连接自然语言需求和可执行代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仅依赖大语言模型的代码生成方法在生成代码质量方面不足，缺乏系统化的需求开发和建模策略，无法保证满足实际需求。

Method: 设计包含三个智能体的多智能体框架，将形式化方法的知识和技术融入需求到代码的生成流程中，使用形式化规范作为自然语言需求和精确代码之间的桥梁。

Result: 框架能够进行严格的正确性推理，发现隐藏错误，并在整个开发过程中强制执行关键属性。

Conclusion: ReDeFo框架为实现可靠、自动生成的软件这一长期愿景迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: Automated code generation has long been considered the holy grail of software
engineering. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a
revolutionary breakthrough in this area. However, existing methods that only
rely on LLMs remain inadequate in the quality of generated code, offering no
guarantees of satisfying practical requirements. They lack a systematic
strategy for requirements development and modeling. Recently, LLM-based agents
typically possess powerful abilities and play an essential role in facilitating
the alignment of LLM outputs with user requirements. In this paper, we envision
the first multi-agent framework for reliable code generation based on
\textsc{re}quirements \textsc{de}velopment and \textsc{fo}rmalization, named
\textsc{ReDeFo}. This framework incorporates three agents, highlighting their
augmentation with knowledge and techniques of formal methods, into the
requirements-to-code generation pipeline to strengthen quality assurance. The
core of \textsc{ReDeFo} is the use of formal specifications to bridge the gap
between potentially ambiguous natural language requirements and precise
executable code. \textsc{ReDeFo} enables rigorous reasoning about correctness,
uncovering hidden bugs, and enforcing critical properties throughout the
development process. In general, our framework aims to take a promising step
toward realizing the long-standing vision of reliable, auto-generated software.

TL;DR: RecovSlicing是一种利用LLM从部分执行痕迹推断程序行为，在单次运行中计算动态数据依赖的方法，解决了传统方法需要全量插桩或程序重放的高成本问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态数据依赖分析方法需要全量插桩或程序重放，成本高昂且对非确定性程序不可行，需要一种更高效的解决方案

Method: 利用LLM从部分记录的执行痕迹和代码上下文中推断程序行为，恢复缺失的执行信息，支持隐式变量，处理运行时值恢复和内存对齐

Result: 在三个切片基准测试的8300个数据依赖上，准确率达到80.3%、91.1%和98.3%，显著优于基线方法，召回率也领先

Conclusion: RecovSlicing在单次运行中有效计算动态数据依赖，性能优于现有方法，集成到回归错误定位器中可发现更多回归问题

Abstract: Dynamic data dependency, answering "why a variable has this value?", is
critical for debugging. Given a program step `s` reading a variable `v`,
finding the dynamic definition of `v` is challenging. Traditional methods
require either (1) exhaustive instrumentation of all possible definitions of
`v` in one run or (2) replicating the run to re-examine reads/writes - both
costly. If `v` is defined in a library, instrumentation becomes expensive; for
non-deterministic programs, replication is infeasible.
  We propose RecovSlicing, which computes dynamic data dependency in a single
run with partial instrumentation. We leverage LLMs to infer program behavior
from a partially recorded trace and code context. Given a trace and a slicing
criterion (step `s` and variable `v`), RecovSlicing estimates the runtime
definition of `v` by recovering the missing execution.It also supports implicit
variables, such as those in `list.get(i)`. Technically, RecovSlicing tackles:
(1) recovering runtime values and structures, and (2) aligning recovered
variables with recorded memory to analyze definitions.
  We evaluate RecovSlicing on 8,300 data dependencies across three slicing
benchmarks, comparing it with Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution
Slicer. RecovSlicing achieves accuracy of 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3%,
outperforming the best baseline (39.0%, 82.0%, 59.9%), and also leads in recall
(91.1%, 91.1%, 98.3% vs. 53.4%, 79.1%, 87.1%). Integrated into a regression bug
localizer, it enables finding 16% more regressions.

TL;DR: 研究分析了16个AI代码审查工具在GitHub上的影响，发现简洁、包含代码片段且手动触发的审查评论更容易导致代码更改


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI代码审查工具逐渐普及，但其实际效果和影响仍不明确，需要大规模实证研究来评估其真正价值

Method: 对178个仓库中22,000多条审查评论进行大规模分析，开发了两阶段LLM辅助框架来判断评论是否被处理，使用可解释的机器学习识别影响因素

Result: 采用率在增长但效果差异较大；简洁、包含代码片段、手动触发的评论（尤其是hunk-level工具）更容易导致代码更改

Conclusion: 结果强调了工具设计的重要性，为改进AI基于代码审查系统提供了方向指导

Abstract: AI-based code review tools automatically review and comment on pull requests
to improve code quality. Despite their growing presence, little is known about
their actual impact. We present a large-scale empirical study of 16 popular
AI-based code review actions for GitHub workflows, analyzing more than 22,000
review comments in 178 repositories. We investigate (1) how these tools are
adopted and configured, (2) whether their comments lead to code changes, and
(3) which factors influence their effectiveness. We develop a two-stage
LLM-assisted framework to determine whether review comments are addressed, and
use interpretable machine learning to identify influencing factors. Our
findings show that, while adoption is growing, effectiveness varies widely.
Comments that are concise, contain code snippets, and are manually triggered,
particularly those from hunk-level review tools, are more likely to result in
code changes. These results highlight the importance of careful tool design and
suggest directions for improving AI-based code review systems.

TL;DR: 研究通过挖掘GitHub项目发现，许多开源项目使用SonarQube Cloud进行静态代码分析，其中81%正确连接，75%使甩组织默认质量门，45%项目会自定义质量门条件来满足特定质量目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查开源项目如何使甩和自定义静态代码分析工具SonarQube Cloud，以了解实际使甩情况和配置习惯。

Method: 通过挖掘GitHub项目数据，分析321个使甩SonarQube Cloud并通过GitHub Actions连接的项目，重点关注质量门配置情况。

Result: 81%项目正确连接SonarQube Cloud，75%使甩组织默认质量门，55%使甩内置质量门，45%自定义质量门条件。最常见的质量条件与"清洁代码"原则一致，涉及安全、可维护性、可靠性、覆盖率等方面。

Conclusion: 许多项目依靠预定义配置，但也有较大比例自定义配置以满足特定质量目标。未来研究可以接入质量门配置与软件实际效果的关联，为不同场景下配置SCA工具提供基于证据的建议。

Abstract: Background: Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools are widely adopted to enforce
code quality standards. However, little is known about how open-source projects
use and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub
projects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method:
We conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub
Actions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using
SonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud
projects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among
265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default
quality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to
pass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate
provided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with
different conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with
SonarQube Cloud's "Clean as You Code" principle and enforce security,
maintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or
modified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined
configurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to
meet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a
future research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software
outcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable
evidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud
in various contexts.

TL;DR: 提出LegoFuzz框架，通过离线生成代码片段和在线组合的方式，高效测试C编译器，发现了66个GCC和LLVM的严重错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的编译器测试方法存在两个问题：生成的测试程序过于简单，以及大规模测试计算成本过高

Method: 将测试过程解耦为两个阶段：离线阶段使用LLM生成小型但功能丰富的代码片段；在线阶段策略性地组合这些片段构建高质量测试程序

Result: 在GCC和LLVM中发现66个错误，其中近一半是现有LLM工具无法发现的严重错误编译错误

Conclusion: 这种高效设计为在软件测试中超越C编译器使用AI模型开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs),
has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key
problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple,
and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this
paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing
process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the
offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich
code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically
combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then
used to test compilers.
  We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The
results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C
compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious
and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We
believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in
software testing beyond just C compilers.

TL;DR: GitTaskBench是一个评估代码代理在真实GitHub仓库工作流中任务解决能力的基准测试，包含54个跨7个领域和模式的任务，结果显示即使最佳系统也只能解决48.15%的任务，突显了环境设置和依赖解析等关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试很少在真实的工作流驱动场景中评估代码代理，而利用大规模代码仓库（如GitHub）进行实际任务解决在现实软件开发中至关重要。

Method: 引入GitTaskBench基准，包含54个现实任务，每个任务配有相关代码仓库和自动化人工评估工具，提出alpha-value指标量化经济收益，并在三个最先进的代理框架和多个先进LLM上进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使表现最佳的系统OpenHands+Claude 3.7也只能解决48.15%的任务，超过一半的失败归因于环境设置和依赖解析等看似简单但关键的步骤。

Conclusion: 利用代码仓库解决复杂任务仍然具有挑战性，需要更强大的工作流管理和超时准备，GitTaskBench的发布旨在推动仓库感知的代码推理、执行和部署方面的进展。

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

Motivation: 测试用例优先级排序的目的是通过合理排列测试用例执行顺序，以早期检测故障，节省重测时间和成本。某些测试用例执行的程序部分可能更容易出错，如果早期执行这些测试用例可以更早地发现错误。

Method: 提出一种静态方法：1) 构建受影响切片图(ASG)来表示受影响的面向对象程序部分；2) 通过计算受影响组件耦合度(ACC)值来确定ASG节点的故障容易程度；3) 为覆盖高ACC值节点的测试用例赋予更高优先级。

Result: 通过第七个案例研究的分析显示，执行故障容易程序部分的测试用例更有可能早期发现故障。与现有技术相比，该方法显示出可行的性和可接受的性能。

Conclusion: 基于受影响组件耦合度(ACC)的静态测试用例优先级方法是有效的，能够在回归测试中早期检测故障，提高测试效率并降低成本。

Abstract: Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of
the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting
faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that
are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during
the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected
regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a
static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected
component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We
construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected
program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing
their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that
cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows
that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher
chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The
result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible
and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.

### [217] [Do More Suspicious Transaction Reports Lead to More Convictions for Money Laundering?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18932)
*Rasmus Ingemann Tuffveson Jensen,Sebastian Holmby Hansen,Kalle Johannes Rose*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究发现可疑交易报告与洗钱定罪之间不存在因果关系，相关关系主要由跨国差异和共同时间趋势驱动，而非报告数量增加导致定罪增加


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查可疑交易报告与洗钱定罪之间的真实关系，为国际反洗钱政策和努力提供实证依据

Method: 使用欧盟公开数据，采用对数转换和固定效应回归模型，控制国家特定混杂因素和时间趋势

Result: 初始结果显示可疑交易报告与洗钱定罪存在次线性幂律关系，但加入时间控制后关系消失，表明是虚假相关而非因果关系

Conclusion: 国家不能统计置信地预期增加可疑交易报告会导致洗钱定罪增加，这对反洗钱政策有重要启示

Abstract: Almost all countries in the world require banks to report suspicious
transactions to national authorities. The reports are known as suspicious
transaction or activity reports (we use the former term) and are intended to
help authorities detect and prosecute money laundering. In this paper, we
investigate the relationship between suspicious transaction reports and
convictions for money laundering in the European Union. We use publicly
available data from Europol, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund,
and the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics. To
analyze the data, we employ a log-transformation and fit pooled (i.e., ordinary
least squares) and fixed effects regression models. The fixed effects models,
in particular, allow us to control for unobserved country-specific confounders
(e.g., different laws regarding when and how reports should be filed). Initial
results indicate that the number of suspicious transaction reports and
convictions for money laundering in a country follow a sub-linear power law.
Thus, while more reports may lead to more convictions, their marginal effect
decreases with their amount. The relationship is robust to control variables
such as the size of shadow economies and police forces. However, when we
include time as a control, the relationship disappears in the fixed effects
models. This suggests that the relationship is spurious rather than causal,
driven by cross-country differences and a common time trend. In turn, a country
cannot, ceteris paribus and with statistical confidence, expect that an
increase in suspicious transaction reports will drive an increase in
convictions.
  Our results have important implications for international anti-money
laundering efforts and policies. (...)

TL;DR: 通过由田纳西州2005年医疗助政收缩导致公共医疗保险丢失的自然实验，研究发现失去保险会导致BMI增加0.38点，超重/肥胖率增加约4%，还会造成健康状况恶化、药物使用减少和体育活动参与度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究公共医疗保险丢失对人们身体重量和健康行为的影响，以了解医疗保障缺乏如何通过未管理的健康问题导致肥胖增加。

Method: 利用田纳西州2005年医疗助政收缩作为自然实验，采用1997-2010年行为风险因素监测系统(BRFSS)数据，进行合成双重差分模型估计。

Result: 改革使田纳西州无子女成年人的BMI增加0.38点，超重/肥胖率增加约4%，"质量差"健康状况报告比例增加21%，疼疼和抗炎药物使用减少，中等体育活动参与度下降。

Conclusion: 医疗保险丢失通过恶化未管理的健康条件导致身体重量增加，强调了医疗保障对于维护健康重量的重要性。该研究还为单一处理集群设置中的偪强推断提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Leveraging Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of
losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors.
Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to
2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models. The estimates
suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the
overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI$\geq$25) by $\sim$4\% among Tennessean
childless adults. My findings -- a 21\% increase in the share of childless
adults reporting ``poor'' health status (the lowest level on the five-point
scale), a reduction in Medicaid-reimbursed utilization of pain and
anti-inflammatory medications, and a reduction in participation in moderate
physical activities -- suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may
be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected weight gain.
Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for conducting robust
inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-treatment data.

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个图论框架来解决网约车平台间的跨平台协作问题，通过三种利润分配机制（均等利润、市场份额、Shapley值）进行大规模模拟，发现Shapley值机制在六个关键指标上表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网约车平台的碎片化限制了系统范围的效率，跨平台协作可以释放显著的效率提升，但需要公平可持续的利润分配机制来协调竞争平台间的激励。

Method: 引入图论框架，在网络优化中嵌入利润感知约束，评估三种分配方案：均等利润分配、市场份额分配和Shapley值分配，并通过大规模模拟进行分析。

Result: Shapley值机制在所有六个关键指标上始终优于其他方案。系统效率和乘客服务质量随需求增加而提高，显示出明显的规模经济效应。需求增长导致超线性边增长和亚线性度缩放，分别扩展了可行匹配和限制了每个乘客的连接性。

Conclusion: 跨平台协作具有显著的效率提升潜力，Shapley值分配机制是实现公平高效跨平台拼车的最佳选择，规模经济效应和网络结构演化规律为平台协作提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft) have transformed urban mobility by
enabling ride-sharing, which holds considerable promise for reducing both
travel costs and total vehicle miles traveled (VMT). However, the fragmentation
of these platforms impedes system-wide efficiency by restricting ride-matching
to intra-platform requests. Cross-platform collaboration could unlock
substantial efficiency gains, but its realization hinges on fair and
sustainable profit allocation mechanisms that can align the incentives of
competing platforms. This study introduces a graph-theoretic framework that
embeds profit-aware constraints into network optimization, facilitating
equitable and efficient cross-platform ride-sharing. Within this framework, we
evaluate three allocation schemes -- equal-profit-based, market-share-based,
and Shapley-value-based -- through large-scale simulations. Results show that
the Shapley-value-based mechanism consistently outperforms the alternatives
across six key metrics. Notably, system efficiency and rider service quality
improve with increasing demand, reflecting clear economies of scale. The
observed economies of scale, along with their diminishing returns, can be
understood with the structural evolution of rider-request graphs, where
super-linear edge growth expands feasible matches and sub-linear degree scaling
limits per-rider connectivity.

TL;DR: 新冠疫情加速了零工经济发展，通过疾病传播与失业搜索匹配耦合模型发现，疫情导致正规就业减少、零工就业增加，长期失业率上升，短期劳动力市场波动剧烈，政策干预需平衡疾病负担与劳动力市场稳定。

Motivation: 研究新冠疫情等流行病如何影响正规经济和零工经济的劳动力市场动态，理解疫情对就业结构的冲击机制。

Method: 开发了一个耦合疾病传播和失业搜索匹配框架的数学模型，分析疫情对劳动力市场的影响。

Result: 疫情导致正规经济就业减少、零工经济就业增加，长期总失业率上升；短期出现劳动力市场紧度和失业率的剧烈波动；长期在地方病均衡下就业减少。

Conclusion: 需要采取公共政策干预，如增加失业救济或为零工提供福利，以缓解疫情对劳动力市场的破坏性影响，但需权衡疾病负担控制与市场稳定之间的平衡。

Abstract: The gig economy has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the
emergence of various facilitating platforms. Triggering substantial shifts to
labour markets across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this
growth. To understand the crucial role of such an epidemic on the dynamics of
labour markets of both formal and gig economies, we develop and investigate a
model that couples disease transmission and a search and match framework of
unemployment. We find that epidemics increase gig economy employment at the
expense of formal economy employment, and can increase the total long term
unemployment. In the short run, large sharp fluctuations in labour market
tightness and unemployment can occur, while in the long run, employment is
reduced under an endemic disease equilibrium. We analyze a public policies that
increase unemployment benefits or provide benefits to gig workers to mitigate
these effects, and evaluate their trade-offs in mitigating disease burden and
labour market disruptions.

Motivation: 扩展Cheng(2025)的研究，探讨在先验模糊性环境下，发送方是否能够通过模糊沟通策略获得额外收益

Method: 分析二元状态和二元行动情况下的说服游戏，比较模糊沟通策略与标准非模糊策略的效果

Result: 在先验模糊性环境下，发送方使用模糊沟通策略仍然无法获得比标准策略更严格的好处

Conclusion: 即使在存在先验模糊性的情况下，发送方也无法通过模糊沟通获得严格收益，这一结果与无先验模糊性的情况一致

Abstract: Cheng (2025) establishes that in a persuasion game where both the sender and
the receiver have Maxmin Expected Utility (MEU) preferences, the sender never
strictly benefits from using ambiguous communication strategies over standard
(non-ambiguous) ones. This note extends the analysis to environments with prior
ambiguity, i.e., pre-existing ambiguity about the payoff-relevant state, and
shows that, in the binary state and binary action case, the same no-gain result
continues to hold.

TL;DR: 机器学习在经济预测中表现出色但缺乏解释性，本文探讨如何将机器学习方法重新构想以指导新经济理论的发展，通过对抗训练、理论约束等方式实现预测与理解的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习算法在经济预测方面超越了传统经济模型，但作为黑箱无法解释结果背后的原因。经济模型的价值不仅在于预测，更在于揭示行为背后的通用机制和因果路径，这对政策制定具有重要指导意义。

Method: 重新构想机器学习方法以符合经济建模目标，包括：对抗训练算法以暴露现有模型的局限性；将经济理论作为算法搜索的约束条件；利用大型语言模型等新技术开辟新研究方向。

Result: 研究表明，当机器学习方法被重新设计以服务于经济建模目标时，可以同时提高预测准确性和理论理解力，超越了单纯应用现成算法的局限性。

Conclusion: 机器学习有潜力指导新经济理论的发展，但需要专门的方法设计来平衡预测性能与理论洞察，通过结合对抗训练、理论约束和新兴技术，可以实现预测与理解的协同提升。

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms can now outperform classic economic models in
predicting quantities ranging from bargaining outcomes, to choice under
uncertainty, to an individual's future jobs and wages. Yet this predictive
accuracy comes at a cost: most machine learning algorithms function as black
boxes, offering little insight into \emph{why} outcomes occur. This article
asks whether machine learning can guide the development of new economic
theories.
  Economic models serve an important purpose beyond prediction -- they uncover
the general mechanisms behind observed behaviors. A model that identifies the
causal pathways of economic development is more valuable than one that merely
predicts which countries will escape poverty, because it enables policymakers
to encourage that development in countries where it might not have happened
otherwise. Similarly, a model that predicts imperfectly across many domains can
be more valuable than one that is highly accurate in a specific domain, since
the former allows insights and data obtained from one setting to inform
decisions and policy in another.
  Applying machine learning algorithms off-the-shelf is unlikely to yield such
models. But recent work shows that, when reconceived with the aims of an
economic modeler in mind, machine learning methods can improve both prediction
and understanding. These approaches range from adversarially training
algorithms to expose the limits of existing models, to imposing economic theory
as a constraint on algorithmic search. Advances in large language models
complement these strategies and open new research directions.

*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于联邦学习的协作框架，用于分割DWI序列中的缺血性卒中病灶，通过共享深度中心无关表征知识，在14个医疗中心的2031个研究中实现了优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中是全球第二大死因和第三大致残原因。虽然DWI成像是临床标准，但病灶分析存在高度变异性，且现有计算方法通常只从单一机构学习，缺乏泛化能力，许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 采用联邦平均(FedAvg)框架，从14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究中共享深度中心无关表征知识，进行缺血性卒中病灶分割。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心实现了DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26的总体性能，优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法。模型展现出强泛化能力，在不同病灶类别间表现一致，在分布外中心也表现可靠(DSC 0.64±0.29、AVD 4.44±8.74，无需额外训练)。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习框架通过共享中心无关表征，有效解决了卒中病灶分割中的机构间变异性问题，实现了良好的泛化性能，为多中心医疗数据协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在RAW域进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型，通过绕过传统的ISP处理流程，在传感器原始数据上直接操作，实现了比现有sRGB域扩散方法更高的保真度和更少的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散方法处理有损的sRGB输入，忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景中的可访问性，导致次优性能。特别是在边缘设备图像视频捕获等场景中，需要直接在RAW域进行图像恢复。

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，构建可扩展的退化管道从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对进行大规模训练，设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度的结果且伪影更少。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域操作，有效解决了sRGB域扩散模型的分布外问题，为图像恢复任务提供了新的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

TL;DR: EMind是一个电磁信号基础模型，通过大规模预训练和物理特性利用，解决了电磁信号处理中的异构性、噪声和跨任务泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号具有高度异构性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，开发长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，利用电磁信号物理特性进行表示学习。

Conclusion: EMind成功建立了电磁信号基础模型，为动态频谱管理、智能交通等应用提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments

### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图频谱域中处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型仅将频谱图方法作为外围组件，需要更数学基础扎实且计算高效的神经符号推理框架

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理

Result: 在多个基准推理数据集上相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面均有提升

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础扎实且计算高效的底层支撑

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于目标导向状态表示的计算框架，认为世界模型的描述性和规范性方面从智能体-环境交互中共同涌现，而非传统强化学习中的分离状态表示和奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将状态表示（描述性）和奖励函数（规范性）视为独立组件，但作者认为这两者可能从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现，这一可能性尚未得到计算建模。

Method: 引入佛教认识论中的目标导向（telic）状态概念，定义为目标等效经验分布的类别。通过统计散度衡量行为策略与期望经验特征之间的差异，提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经层面的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解跨不同基质的目性行为提供了新的理论视角，挑战了传统强化学习的分离模型假设，强调目标导向状态表示在智能行为中的核心作用。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，使用三个LLM智能体从不同角度生成旅游推荐，通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商，有效提升推荐多样性和平衡性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众景点得到关注

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）分别生成推荐，然后通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商和整合

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提高了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的小众地点

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的方法在LLM驱动的推荐系统中具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型控制群体中代理的语言驱动导航咄对话系统，实现更现实的群体模拟咄出现性组织行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体模拟方法很少考虑语言咄对话对人类导航行为的影响，代理间交互主要仅为遥控咄固定高层目标，导致模拟不够现实

Method: 构建包含对话系统咄语言驱动导航的方法：周期性查询代理中心的LLM（条件包含人物性格、角色、渴望、关系）生成对话，然后结合对话内容、人格、情感状态、视觉咄物理状态来控制导航咄遥控

Result: 在复杂场景中验证方法有效，观察到代理自动组合咄解散，方法作为群体内信息传递机制，产生更现实的群体模拟咄出现性组织行为

Conclusion: 通过语言模型控制群体代理的对话咄导航，能够实现更现实的人类行为模拟，让组织行为自然地从环境设置中出现

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [5] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现推理预算增加反而损害LLM置信度校准，检索增强生成比纯推理表现更好，信息访问是置信度校准的关键瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型作为问答工具时的置信度校准问题，研究推理能力和计算预算如何影响置信度评估准确性

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下的LLM置信度校准表现，比较纯推理与检索增强生成方法

Result: 推理LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会系统性导致过度自信，检索增强生成方法达到89.3%准确率

Conclusion: 信息访问而非推理深度或推理预算是改进知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键限制因素，挑战了"测试时扩展"范式

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [7] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时提高安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐，导致不安全行为。现有方法需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架，包含MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性，设计SSI指标检测潜在不安全的层，并通过后剪枝降低风险。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将劳动力管理模型化为抽象论证问题，通过让相关方参与论证来提供可解释的决策，以满足实时变化需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力管理在执行时经常需要调整但缺乏有效的解释机制，导致相关方对变化的理解和接受度低

Method: 将劳动力管理问题模型化为抽象论证框架，允许相关方参与论证过程，从而产生可解释的决策

Result: 用户研究显示，该方法和解释机制能够活跃处理变化，比传统手工方法更快速和准确地解决问题

Conclusion: 通过抽象论证模型化劳动力管理问题，可以在工业应用中有效处理变化并提供可信的解释，提高决策的可接受性

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

### [9] [Open-Universe Assistance Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119)
*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Open-Universe Assistance Games框架和GOOD方法，通过LLM模拟用户意图来推断自然语言目标，在文本购物和模拟家庭环境中较基线方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体现式AI代理在应对多样化、未预定义的人类目标和偏好时的挖掘和理解问题，需要一种能够处理无界目标空间的方法。

Method: 提出GOOD方法，利用LLM模拟不同复杂意图的用户，通过对话提取自然语言目标并进行概率推断，支持丰富的目标表征和不确定性估计。

Result: 在文本购物领域和AI2Thor模拟家庭机器人环境中评估，使用合成用户评价。GOOD方法在LLM和人类评估中都显著超过了没有显式目标跟踪的基线方法。

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够在不需要大规模离线数据集的情况下，通过在线对话提取和推断自然语言目标，为处理开放式世界中的人类目标推断提供了一种数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: 为AI科学家建立了下一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决GUI代理在不同桌面和移动环境中的综合能力问题，包括定位、问答、规划、决策和程序知识等多个任务

Method: 采用大规模环境基础设施、多样化的基础代理能力集成、可扩展的环境强化学习框架，以及自演进的GUI轨迹生产框架

Result: GUI-Owl-7B在AndroidWorld上达到66.4分，在OSWorld上达到29.4分；Mobile-Agent-v3进一步提升到73.3和37.7分，创下开源GUI代理框架的新纪录

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为GUI代理领域提供了强大的开源解决方案，通过创新的基础设施和能力集成实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模合成可验证的数学逻辑谜题数据，通过编码种子谜题、系统化变异和约束随机化来生成多样化、可扩展的基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量的可验证数学逻辑数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)框架，将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范，通过变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，并通过复制机制确保有效性。

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化谜题的基准数据集，在PuzzleClone测试集上平均准确率从14.4提升到56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得最高12.5个百分点的绝对提升。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够有效生成大规模、高质量的可验证数学逻辑数据，显著提升LLM在逻辑推理任务上的性能，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出了首个开源手术伤口数据集SurgWound和诊断基准，开发了三阶段学习框架WoundQwen用于手术伤口分析和报告生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术部位感染是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，现有研究受限于数据隐私和专家标注成本，缺乏公开数据集和开源筛查工具

Method: 三阶段学习框架：第一阶段用5个MLLM预测具体伤口特征，第二阶段用2个MLLM进行感染风险评估，第三阶段整合结果生成综合报告

Result: 创建了包含697张手术伤口图像的数据集，标注了8个细粒度临床属性，建立了包含VQA和报告生成任务的基准

Conclusion: 该框架能够分析详细的手术伤口特征并提供个性化护理指导，为及时干预和改善患者预后铺平道路

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了LLM4Sweat框架，通过三阶段流程为稀有疾病多汗痆提供可靠的医疗支持，解决了细调数据稀缺和不可靠的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在医疗健康领域有应用潜力，但对于稀有疾病如多汗痆（影响2-3%人口），细调数据稀缺且不可靠，限制了LLM在该领域的应用。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）数据增废：用前沿LLM生成医学可行的合成案例；2）细调：在开源基础模型上进行细调；3）推理与专家评估：临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和共情能力，并迭代丰富数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架为多汗痆等稀有疾病提供了一种可推广的解决方案，能够充分利用前沿LLM的能力来克服数据稀缺和信任挑战。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

### [15] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能，发现约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对大语言模型在高约束环境下推理可靠性的系统评估，特别是在资源约束项目调度这类NP完全问题中。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，在DAG中逐步增加非冗余的前序约束，然后引入停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中进行实例化评估。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近天花板，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在约束交互复杂场景中的泛化能力有限，合成测试的性能不能保证在领域实际场景中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出See it. Say it. Sorted.系统，使用VLM和LLM协同工作，将手绘草图转换为可编辑的SVG矢量图，在流程图生成上优于GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在照片级真实感方面表现出色，但在处理流程图等需要空间精度、对齐和符号结构的任务时存在困难，需要更精确的草图到图表生成方法。

Method: 训练无关的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大语言模型(LLMs)，通过迭代循环：批评家VLM提出编辑建议，多个候选LLMs生成SVG更新，法官VLM选择最佳候选，确保稳定改进。

Result: 在10个基于已发表论文流程图的草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更忠实地重建布局和结构，准确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法优先考虑定性推理而非脆弱的数值估计，保持全局约束，支持人工干预，输出可编程SVG便于扩展，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Result: 在1,290个地块的真实案例中，CR+DES算法在土地利用兼容性上比现有方法提升3.16%，MSBX+MO在价格优化上提升3.3%。统计分析证实采用差分向量的算法在多个指标上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 约束松弛技术能够在保持实际约束的同时实现更广泛的解空间探索，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，支持快速城市化地区更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

TL;DR: 提出基于认知心理学理论的多记忆系统(MMS)，通过处理短期记忆为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，有效提升智能体对历史数据的利用效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体记忆模块如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响召回性能和响应质量，需要更好的长期记忆构建方法。

Method: 设计多记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建一一对应的检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，检索时匹配最相关的检索单元并获取对应上下文作为响应知识。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上实验证明该方法有效，消融研究验证了记忆单元的合理性，分析了记忆片段数量和存储开销的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够有效构建高质量长期记忆内容，提升智能体对历史数据的利用能力，具有实用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory的框架，通过粗粒度到细粒度的记忆机制增强LLM在复杂规划任务中的表现，解决了现有单粒度记忆方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理的记忆机制主要基于单一粒度的环境交互记忆，受限于经验收集质量，导致知识多样性和规划灵活性不足。需要一种更灵活的记忆框架来适应多样化场景。

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：1）在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）面对环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思。

Result: 该方法能够更充分地利用记忆，实现对不同场景的灵活适应，特别是在环境异常情况下能够进行有效的计划修正。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制显著提升了LLM代理在复杂规划任务中的表现和适应性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好两种人类反馈，通过相似性搜索为偏好轨迹中的每个转移分配重要性权重，解决信用分配问题，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配不明确

Method: SPW方案：为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似性得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，用这些权重指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效结合偏好和演示进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于同时利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW成功统一了两种人类反馈源，解决了偏好学习中的信用分配问题，实现了更准确的奖励学习

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种主题导向的多模态框架TGMA，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，通过新的RETAIL数据集实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1)假设用户提供显式查询，而实际需求常隐式；2)忽略多样化的环境因素和用户偏好，限制了规划的可行性；3)只能生成基本的POI排布，无法提供全面详细的旅行规划。

Method: 构建了新的RETAIL数据集，支持隐式查询的决策同时覆盖显式查询，包含修订需求。该数据集还支持环境感知以确保实际场景下规划的可行性，并添加详细的POI信息。提出了主题导向的多模态框架TGMA。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是最强的现有模型也仅能达到1.0%的通过率，说明实际旅行规划仍然极具挑战性。相比之下，TGMA框架展现了显著提升的性能，达到2.72%的通过率。

Conclusion: 该研究通过新的RETAIL数据集和TGMA框架，有效地解决了现有旅行规划系统的不足，为实际旅行规划领域提供了有前晨的方向。TGMA框架在性能上实现了显著提升，证明了其在处理隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的有效性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力不足，且缺乏开放式推理支持，需要一种能够统一处理ECG信号和自然语言的集成方法。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多项任务中取得强劲性能，并保持对分布外设置的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示集成到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了更通用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define

we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但过长的推理链会导致过度思考、计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理长度。

Method: 建立显式的块结构范式，模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后相应划分推理；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的直接偏好优化、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制推理深度。

Result: 实现了自适应推理能力，模型能够根据问题难度调整推理深度，在保持性能的同时提高计算效率。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过动态调节推理块数实现了从零推理到深度推理的自适应能力，提升了推理效率和部署灵活性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略提供了新框架，证明了群体间竞争可以促进合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

*Ahmed Nasir,Abdelhafid Zenati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于动力系统理论的RL策略安全验证框架，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，定量评估策略安全性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中应用受限，缺乏验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的形式化方法

Method: 将RL智能体与环境建模为离散时间自治动力系统，使用FTLE识别LCS结构，提出MBR、ASAS、TASAS等量化指标

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中验证了框架有效性，成功识别仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略

Conclusion: 该框架提供了全面可解释的策略行为评估，能够发现隐藏的安全问题，为安全关键RL应用提供形式化验证工具

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

TL;DR: Agentics是一个模块化框架，用于构建基于代理的系统，支持结构化推理和组合泛化，通过数据建模而非提示工程实现声明式编程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI工作流需要大量手动设计提示，缺乏结构化推理能力。Agentics旨在让开发者专注于数据建模，而不是繁琐的提示工程。

Method: 将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用代理实现逻辑转换。提供声明式语言，LLM提供数据类型并通过逻辑转换组合。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中达到最先进精度或改进可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI工作流提供了新的数据建模方法，通过逻辑转换和组合泛化实现了更好的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势。研究将其适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行，并开发了基于向量的检索机制和文本处理管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供向量符号替代方案，以获得更好的可扩展性、架构定义的块相似性，并保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数版本，建立文本处理管道，创建基于向量表示的块检索机制。

Result: 初步结果表明，在保持HDM向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的回忆）的同时，能够使之前的ACT-R模型在声明性记忆部分几乎无需修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功集成到ACT-R中，保持了向量符号优势并与现有模型兼容。未来将改进时间上下文表示，并开发基于实例学习理论的决策模型来进一步测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化多智能体强化学习中个体智能体的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈即可评估智能体行为贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖显式奖励信号或价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈的情况下难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种仅通过策略分布分析就能获得有意义见解的方法。

Method: 受智能体倾向于追求收敛工具价值现象启发，提出ICVs方法：基于信息论Shapley值，通过评估队友决策不确定性和偏好对齐，量化每个智能体对其队友工具赋能的因果影响。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，识别出哪些智能体行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为合作动态提供了新颖见解，增强了MARL系统的可解释性，能够在没有价值反馈的情况下可靠地理解个体智能体行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，揭示AI数据生命周期的递归价值链如何挑战现有负责任AI框架，提出基于Simondon哲学的形式化AI生命周期模型和"未来性"概念，强调需要针对基础设施和时间动态的监管措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统从数据摄入到部署的完整生命周期中产生的递归价值链，特别是数据在AI系统中的动态"生成"过程对技术操作和经济逻辑的基础性影响。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合技术分析和哲学理论，引入基于Simondon技术哲学的形式化AI生命周期模型（包括前个体环境、个体化和个体化AI），并提出"未来性"概念来描述AI自我强化的递归生命周期。

Result: 识别了监管盲点，揭示了数据递归生成的非竞争性本质，以及技术寡头通过捕获、训练和部署基础设施集中价值和决策权所导致的权力不对称加剧问题。

Conclusion: 有效监管必须解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI应用加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但此前缺乏生产环境中的实际测量研究。

Method: 提出并执行了全面的测量方法，涵盖AI服务基础设施的完整堆栈，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能耗、空闲机器容量和数据中心能耗开销，通过对Google Gemini AI助手基础设施进行详细检测。

Result: 发现Gemini Apps文本提示中位数能耗为0.24Wh，远低于公开估计；Google的软件效率优化和清洁能源采购使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹减少44倍；文本提示能耗低于看电视9秒，用水量相当于5滴水。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注；全面的环境指标测量对于准确比较模型和激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Motivation: 人工智能代理与人类形成的假社交关系对人类健康造成严重危害，需要一种可在私密对话中及早识别这种关系的方法

Method: 重新调整现有的最先进语言模型，构建了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估进行中对话的假社交线索

Result: 在30个合成对话数据集上进行迭代评估，在宽松一致性规则下成功识别所有假社交对话，无误报，通常在前几次交流内即可检测到

Conclusion: 评估代理提供了一种可行的解决方案，可以预防人工智能代理与人类形成假社交关系

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法独立处理各维度且缺乏可解释性，自动化方法难以动态适应和语义推理。

Method: 引入语言引导调优(LGT)框架，使用三个专门智能体：提出配置变更的顾问、评估进展的评估器、精化决策过程的优化器，结合文本梯度提供语义反馈。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时获得性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过多智能体语言模型和文本梯度成功解决了配置优化的关键挑战，实现了性能提升和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

TL;DR: 统一的协同训练框架，通过系统指令动态激活不同安全行为，在单个SFT阶段实现精细可控的内容安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前SFT和RLHF方法存在的多阶段训练流程复杂、缺乏部署后精细控制能力的问题。

Method: 通过协同训练框架，在单个SFT阶段集成积极、消极和拒绝三种安全行为，使用系统指令或魔法标记动态激活。

Result: 8B模型在安全性能上超过DeepSeek-R1(671B)，达到SFT+DPO的安全对齐质量，同时大幅降低训练复杂度和部署成本。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Motivation: 现有多语言数学评测集主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心的实体，导致在低资源语言中的多语言数学推理能力偏差。真正的本土化数据集缺乏，需要解决文化偏向问题。

Method: 设计了一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够从现有数据源中自动构建包含本土名称、组织和货币等实体的数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，翻译的评测集可能隐藏了真正的多语言数学能力。该框架能够减少英语中心实体偏向，提高各种语言中本土实体的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言数学推理提供了有效的文化本土化方案，能够更准确地评估LLM在不同文化背景下的数学能力，提升多语言AI系统的全面性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

Conclusion: DPO方法能够有效利用相对较少的高质量数据来提升大语言模型的机器翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言场景下表现出良好的效果。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了多语言ConvXAI系统的新方法，包括创建MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass自定义输入数据集，以解决当前对话解释系统在多语言和自定义输入方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于意图识别的ConvXAI系统在英语上表现良好，但缺乏多语言训练数据导致多语言通用性不足，同时对自由形式自定义输入的支持也有限。

Method: 首先创建了MultiCoXQL多语言扩展数据集（包含5种语言），提出了新的多语言解析方法，并在多种解析策略下评估了三种LLM模型。同时提出了Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取，并进行了单语言、跨语言和多语言评估。

Result: 研究对三种不同规模的LLM模型和BERT类型模型进行了评测，验证了新方法在多语言环境下的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言ConvXAI系统提供了数据集和方法支持，有效解决了多语言通用性和自定义输入支持的挑战，推进了对话式解释人工智能系统的发展。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样(SSS)算法，通过在推理时使用对齐的小型草稿模型来高效实现测试时对齐，显著降低推理成本的同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但往往带来巨大的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题

Method: 使用奖励偏移推测采样算法，让小型草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励令牌分布来利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，该算法以显著降低的推理成本实现了优越的黄金奖励分数

Conclusion: SSS算法有效解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，通过利用分布偏移在不实际获得RLHF最优解的情况下恢复最优解，验证了方法的有效性和效率

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、语义过滤和结构化蕴含检查来提升长文本问答的完整性评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易出错，LLM评估方法存在幻觉和对齐问题。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 将答案分解为自包含事实 2) 通过词汇和语义过滤缩小候选匹配 3) 结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个长形式问答基准测试中，相比强基线方法，LongRecall在召回准确性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建模块，能减少假阳性和假阴性，适应多样化表达和上下文变化。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将大语言模型与组合推理相结合的方法，通过符号推理提升LLM在结构化预测任务中的一致性和准确性，并证明结构化学习在LLM时代仍有价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在各种语言任务中表现出色，但由于自回归特性，容易产生幻觉和复杂推理问题。特别是在结构化预测领域，需要解决一致性和准确性问题。

Method: 结合LLM与组合推理方法，通过提示策略估计LLM置信度值，并在此基础上进行符号推理。同时使用结构化预测目标进行校准和微调。

Result: 实验表明，无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上增加符号推理都能产生更一致和准确的预测。结构化学习目标的使用显著提升了在挑战性任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 符号推理与LLM的结合有效解决了结构化预测中的一致性问题，结构化学习在LLM时代仍然具有重要价值，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Nemotron-CC-Math数据集，通过新的管道从Common Crawl中提取高质量数学内容，解决了以往数据质量下降问题，在数学和代码理解任务上取得显著攻加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学数据集存在质量下降问题，包括脆弱的提取算法、HTML到文本转换损失以及数学结构保存不可靠。需要构建更高质量的数学预训练语料库。

Method: 设计了一种新的域无关管道，利用布局感知渲染和LLM基础的清理步骤，能够恢复各种格式的数学内容，保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除模板文本并标准化为LaTeX表示。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) 和 Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens)两个大规模高质量数据集。在Nemotron-T 8B模型上预训练，在MATH数据集上获得4.8-12.6的提升，在MBPP+代码数据集上获得4.6-14.3的提升，同时在MMLU和MMLU-Stem通用域任务上也有改善。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了第一个能够从噪声网络数据中可靠提取科学内容的管道，在数学、代码和通用理解能力方面都取得了显著进步，设置了开源数学预训练语料库的新标杆。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大型语言模型(LLM)由于幻觉问题经常产生误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证，利用外部证据来缓解幻觉，通过生成和验证原子假设来提供可解释的答案。

Result: 在五个LLM上的实验表明：(1)整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 利用外部证据和原子假设验证的方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉，提高回答的可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉-语言模型在复杂多轮多模态任务中存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，而现有评测集无法充分测试这些挑战。

Method: 构建了MMDR-Bench评测集（300个复杂多轮对话场景），并提出CoLVLM Agent框架，通过"记忆-感知-规划-执行"迭代循环增强现有LVLM的理解能力，无需重新训练。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上表现优异，平均人工评分4.03分，超越GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85），在理解深度、指令遵循和错误压制方面显著优势。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计和迭代方法有效提升了多模态多轮对话的理解能力，为复杂多模态交互任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [50] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一个语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少token冗余，根据语义密度分配异构粒度，在长文本建模中实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足，特别是在长文本场景中。

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类以合并语义等效的token；然后基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵span中使用粗粒度压缩。

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长文本建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督来评估金融推理任务中的中间推理步骤，在多个应用场景中显著优于通用PRM和领域基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型(PRM)主要针对通用或STEM领域训练，在金融等特定领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更加结构化、符号化且对事实和监管正确性敏感。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM，一个领域专业化的轨迹感知PRM，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用PRM和强领域基线，下游模型在监督学习、强化学习和测试时性能分别获得12.9%、5.2%和5.1%的提升。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于将大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别对KV缓存进行剪枝来减少长上下文推理中的内存和计算开销，同时动态恢复被剪枝的条目以保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的KV缓存瓶颈问题，现有方法主要沿时间轴压缩但忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的重要性变化，限制了效率和精度的平衡。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV缓存应用非结构化稀疏性（剪枝），在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复被剪枝的条目，该方法与现有的KV压缩和量化技术正交兼容。

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，对等长序列减少KV缓存存储30%以上，即使在80%的激进剪枝比例下，性能下降也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道级剪枝有效解决了KV缓存瓶颈，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了内存和计算效率，且与现有技术兼容，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在领域特定场景中表现不佳，RAG存在幻觉和延迟问题，持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出S2K框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调，引入结构化推理数据生成流程并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K持续优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本匹配领域预训练的LLM。

Conclusion: S2K提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，通过渐进式知识获取策略有效解决了领域特定知识的长尾分布问题，实现了与昂贵预训练方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地用过去成功轨迹增强经验池

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，困难问题上提升4.7%；在τ-bench真实场景中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升

Conclusion: SEER通过自引导的经验检索方法有效解决了LLM在多步骤工具使用中的挑战，实现了持续的性能改进，无需大量手动工程

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动检查表生成作为一种有前景的方法，但其有效性尚未充分探索。研究旨在确定检查表的使用策略和有效性。

Method: 研究通过六种方法生成检查表，在八种模型规模上进行实验，分析检查表项目与人工评估的相关性，并在成对比较和直接评分任务中评估检查表效果。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。低相关性检查表项目仍反映人工编写标准，表明人工评估存在不一致性。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少小语言模型词汇相关组件的内存使用，最高可达99%，且性能损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在资源受限环境中有计算优势，但词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）由于词汇量大导致内存占用过高，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和词汇相关组件计算不对称性的洞察，提出VocabTailor框架：通过卸载嵌入实现内存约束处理，并为LM Head采用混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在多样化下游任务上的综合实验表明，VocabTailor能将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，且任务性能仅有最小或没有退化，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了小语言模型部署中的内存瓶颈问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低内存需求，为边缘设备部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，一个人工编写的泰语指令数据集，用于评估和微调大语言模型在泰语中的表现，解决低资源语言的文化和专业领域细差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型在英语上表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现待探索。存在的测试集依赖翻译，缺乏文化和领域特定的细差，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盛56个专业领域和7种任务类型。通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员的多阶段质量控制过程制作。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的表现差距；(2)指令微调研究，隔离本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct微调的模型在领域内外测试中都超过使用翻译数据的模型。显示了文化和专业基础指令数据对改善模型在低资源语言中表现的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究突出了需要基于文化和专业背景的本土指令数据，才能有效提升大语言模型在语言多样性低资源环境中的对齐能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

Motivation: 解决代码切换语音技术中数据集稀缺的问题，推动多语言语音系统发展

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（同义词替换单词），在保持句子语义的前提下用翻译替换选定单词，考虑词性因素

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可理解性和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法能有效推进代码切换语音技术发展，构建更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的人格特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLMs比人类教师更理想化和极化，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对模拟职业角色的大语言模型进行全面的心理和伦理评估，特别是在教育领域需要评估教师角色的道德规范和心理特征。

Method: 开发EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建88个教师特定道德困境，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，推理能力更强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在检索的上下文与LLM参数知识冲突时，无法有效解决这种上下文-记忆冲突问题，导致模型可能被错误的外部信息误导

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE)框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆token嵌入和基于grounded/adversarial的软提示训练，来识别不可靠上下文并引导推理

Result: 在问答和事实核查基准测试中，CARE平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为解决RAG系统中的可信知识冲突问题提供了有前景的方向，能够构建更可靠和自适应的RAG系统

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识的流程，构建了TComQA数据集，该数据集在提取时间常识方面达到80%以上的精确度，训练出的模型在时间问答任务上优于现有数据集微调的LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件需要掌握其时间上下文，但时间常识在自然语言中很少明确提及，即使先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本。自动挖掘时间常识有助于构建更强大的语言模型。

Method: 研究LLMs从文本中提取时间常识的能力，提出时间常识提取流程，利用LLMs自动挖掘时间常识，并从SAMSum和RealNews语料库构建TComQA数据集。

Result: TComQA数据集通过众包验证，在提取时间常识方面达到80%以上的精确度。使用TComQA训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于现有数据集微调的LLM。

Conclusion: 提出的时间常识提取流程和TComQA数据集有效提升了模型在时间推理任务上的性能，证明了自动挖掘时间常识的可行性。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE是一个轻量级模型，仅需120毫秒音频即可捕获音素特征，通过独立处理短固定窗口实现跨语言竞争性能，证明了通过建模音素长度窗口中的基础声学模式可以实现有效的通用语音处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，而传统通用音素识别通常需要分析长语音段和语言特定模式。

Method: 开发CUPE模型，处理短固定宽度窗口（120毫秒，约一个音素长度）并独立分析，学习所有语言共有的基础声学模式，采用监督和自监督训练。

Result: 在包括UCLA语音语料库零样本测试在内的多种语言评估中，表现出强大的跨语言泛化能力，参数量少于当前方法但达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口中的基础声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理，证明了轻量级模型在跨语言音素识别中的潜力。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 知识图补全模型评估面临跨数据集和多指标不一致性挑战，本文提出EDAS统一元评估指标，将多重指标综合为单一分数，提供更可靠的模型比较框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图补全(KGC)模型在不同数据集和评估指标(MRR、Hit@k等)上表现不一致，导致模型选择困难。常规指标无法统一评估跨数据集性能，需要一种统一的元评估指标来综合多重指标和数据集的表现。

Method: 提出KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS)方法，这是一种精强且可解释的元评估指标。该方法将模型在多个数据集和多种评估标准下的表现综合为一个标准化的单一分数(M_i ∈ [0,1])，通过计算与平均解的距离来实现。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等标准数据集上的实验结果显示，EDAS能够有效地将多重指标和多数据集的性能综合为统一的排名，提供了一致、稳健且可推广的KGC模型评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS方法充分满足了对统一元评估指标的需求，能够在跨数据集和多重评估标准下对KGC模型进行全局性能综合评估，为模型选择提供了更可靠和可解释的决策支持，促进了KGC领域的公平评测。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Conclusion: 研究为未来评测基准的创新提供了可参考的设计范式，应关注基准的公平性、可靠性和动态适应能力

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的可信度评估方法往往关注狭窄方面，忽视了多模态引入的风险，需要构建一个全面的评估框架来系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维度框架：5个可信度方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、2种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）、多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法）。包含32个任务和28个精选数据集。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著脆弱性，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略存在局限性，多数方法在改善特定方面的同时会引入意外的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过赋予模型思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态推测长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了加速效果和适应性

Method: 利用起草模型输出分布的熵和边界不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程，实现更灵活的token接受机制

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用解决方案，能够在不同不确定性条件下实现高效鲁棒的LLM解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验证明语言模型中词汇表较大的好处来自于降低了文本的复杂性，而非解决词频不平衡问题。模型利用了词频不平衡来优化常见单词的预测准确性，这种优势能够转移到下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的词汇表趋向越来越大，但其实际改善的根源不清楚。本文想要探索词汇表扩大如何影响模型性能，以及词频分布不平衡在其中的作用。

Method: 进行受控实验，在保持数据、计算资源和优化策略不变的情况下，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K。使用Kolmogorov复杂性量化文本复杂性，并通过词级损失分解分析不同词频单词的贡献。

Result: 词汇表扩大主要通过降低文本复杂性来改善模型性能，而非解决词频不平衡。词汇表越大，对前2,500个常见单词的预测不确定性越低，尽管尾部稀有词的损失反而上升。模型实际上利用了词频不平衡来优化常见单词的预测。

Conclusion: 词汇表扩大的好处在于降低了文本的复杂性，而非解决词频不平衡。这为词汇器与模型的协同设计提供了理论基础，也清楚地解释了预训练过程中的损失动态。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MCR-BENCH标准化测试框架，用于评估大规模音频-语言模型在处理音频-文本矩阵不一致信息时的表现，发现模型存在显著的文本偏向问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模音频-语言模型在处理多模态输入时的表现已经得到了评估，但对于模态间存在冲突信息的情况下模型的优先级选择能力仍然缺乏系统性研究。需要一个专门的测试框架来评估模型在处理不一致音频-文本对时的表现。

Method: 研究中开发了MCR-BENCH标准化测试框架，通过广泛的评估涉及多种音频理解任务，专门测试大规模音频-语言模型在处理不一致音频-文本对时的表现。还进一步研究了影响文本偏向的因素，通过监督微调探索减缓策略，并分析了模型的自信度模式。

Result: 研究发现了一个让人担忧的现象：当模态间存在不一致时，大规模音频-语言模型显示出显著的文本输入偏向，经常忽视音频证据。这种偏向导致音频中心任务的性能显著降低，并引发了实际应用中的可靠性问题。模型在处理矛盾输入时仍然保持持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在训练过程中改善模态平衡的必要性，以及需要更精细的融合机制来提升模型在处理冲突多模态输入时的稳健性。MCR-BENCH框架为评估和改善大规模音频-语言模型的可靠性提供了重要的工具。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaSO是首个完全开源的大规模语音-语言建模端到端框架，包含对齐语料库、指令调优数据集和可复现基准测试，旨在解决该领域架构碎片化和缺乏透明度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语音-语言模型发展受限于碎片化架构和缺乏透明度，模型权重发布时往往缺少对应的训练数据和配置，阻碍了系统性比较和研究的可复现性。

Method: 提出LLaSO框架，包含三个核心资源：1200万实例的语音-文本对齐语料库、1350万实例的多任务指令调优数据集，以及可复现的标准化评估基准。基于此训练了38亿参数的参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型达到0.72的标准化分数，建立了强大且可复现的基线，超越了同类可比模型。分析显示广泛训练覆盖能提升性能，但在未见任务上仍存在显著泛化差距。

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准测试和模型，LLaSO为统一研究努力和加速社区驱动的大规模语音-语言模型进展建立了基础性开放标准。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

M-Help, specifically designed to detect help-seeking behavior on social media.
The dataset goes beyond traditional labels by identifying not only help-seeking
activity but also specific mental health disorders and their underlying causes,
such as relationship challenges or financial stressors. AI models trained on
M-Help can address three key tasks: identifying help-seekers, diagnosing mental
health conditions, and uncovering the root causes of issues.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了语言翻译中的非对应词汇问题，提出了从源语言向目标语言转换非对应词的方法和规则，并将达尔吴兹别克语中的25个非对应词转换为英语和俄语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言理解与翻译知识直接相关，非对应词汇（如食物、服装、文化和传统词汇）容易导致误解，需要找到在目标语言中的对应表达方式。

Method: 采用图书馆基础研究方法，分析了从源语言向目标语言转换非对应词汇的不同方法和规则。

Result: 研究提出了多种转换非对应词汇的方法，并成功将达尔吴兹别克语中的25个非对应词转换为英语和俄语。

Conclusion: 虽然部分非对应词已经有专业转换方式，但仍有许多词汇需要进一步研究和转换，本研究为语言翻译领域提供了有用的方法论和实践案例。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: PyTOD是一个通过生成可执行代码来跟踪对话状态的任务导向对话代理，使用策略和执行反馈进行高效纠错，在SGD基准测试中达到最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的状态跟踪，需要更好的方法来提升状态跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的状态跟踪性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和反馈机制显著提升了对话状态跟踪的性能。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

TL;DR: RadReason是一个新的放射学报告评估框架，提供细粒度错误类型评分和可解释的评分理由，超越了现有方法并达到与GPT-4相当的评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告自动评估方法要么评分过于粗糙，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，缺乏临床可解释性和细粒度评估能力，限制了在真实临床工作流程中的应用。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization构建，包含两个关键创新：1) Sub-score Dynamic Weighting - 基于实时F1统计自适应优先处理临床挑战性错误类型；2) Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling - 基于子评分一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的水平，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床可解释、细粒度且高效的放射学报告评估框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: SLM4Offer是一个基于对比学习的生成式AI模型，通过在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关优惠，实现了比监督微调基线高17%的优惠接受率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销对提升客户参与度和业务增长至关重要，现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，而优惠个性化具有显著提升转化率和客户满意度的潜力。研究表明良好执行的个性化策略可使收入提升高达40%。

Method: 通过微调预训练的编码器-解码器语言模型（Google的T5-Small 60M），采用对比学习方法，使用InfoNCE损失在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和优惠，引入自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间并增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在模拟客户行为和优惠接受模式的合成数据集上进行微调和评估，实验结果显示相比监督微调基线，优惠接受率提高了17%。

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面具有显著效果，SLM4Offer模型通过创新的对比学习方法有效提升了优惠个性化性能。

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

TL;DR: 小型语言模型通过网页级切分和聚类特定训练，在浏览行为预测中超过大型模型，并通过聚类特定参数进一步提升性能和对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑大型语言模型是否能够有效处理主观性强的用户浏览行为，这种行为形成了每个用户独特的"浏览语言"，需要更有针对性的模型方案。

Method: 提出HeTLM聚类训练方法，使用网页级切分器训练小型模型，并为不同用户聚类配置异质参数集，以捕捉用户行为的异质性。

Result: 小型模型在浏览语言表现上超过大型预训练或微调模型；HeTLM在控制参数数量的情况下超过单一模型；实现了更高的平均性能和更低的方差，提升了用户级别的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 对于主观性行为预测，小型专门化模型组合聚类特定训练比大型通用模型更有效，能够更好地捕捉用户行为的异质性和提升对齐性。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，使用基于模型训练数据影响力的课程学习（从简单到复杂排序训练样本）相比传统人工定义难度指标，能够使语言模型预训练性能提升10个百分点以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，研究者希望探索是否使用更符合模型训练过程中观察到的样本难度指标（训练数据影响力）能够提升课程学习的效果

Method: 通过计算训练样本对模型输出的影响力分数来排序训练数据，构建模型中心的课程学习策略，替代传统基于人工定义难度的排序方法

Result: 使用训练数据影响力排序的课程学习方法在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的性能高出10个百分点以上

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练确实有益，但需要采用更模型中心的难度概念，而非传统的人工定义难度指标

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，使用希伯来语调优的大语言模型取得了最佳效果（F1=0.74）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份检测数据集主要是英语中心、单标签且关注粗粒度身份类别，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中细粒度社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建HebID语料库（5536个句子），手动标注12种社会身份，使用多标签和单标签编码器以及2B-9B参数生成式LLM进行基准测试，并应用于政客的Facebook帖子和议会演讲分析。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM表现最佳（宏F1=0.74），分析发现了受欢迎度差异、时间趋势、聚类模式以及身份表达中的性别相关变化。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，实现了精英话语与公众身份优先级的比较。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Conclusion: Dream 7B证明了扩散建模在语言生成任务中的有效性，发布了Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct两个版本以促进基于扩散的语言建模研究。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches

two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全评估基准依赖人工构建，存在时间资源消耗大、冗余度高和难度有限的问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和效果。

Method: 通过协调7个专门代理构建自动化流水线，配备多功能工具确保过程可控性，并将人类专业知识整合到自动化流程中。

Conclusion: SafetyFlow首次实现了完全自动化的基准构建流程，提供了全面的安全基准，显著提升了LLM安全评估的效率和覆盖范围。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO框架通过自判别引导优化，利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过强化学习增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力强于作为生成器防御有害内容的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究者探索对齐模型的判别和生成能力。

Method: 提出SDGO（自判别引导优化）强化学习框架，利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来增强生成安全性。

Result: 实验表明SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，在保持通用基准测试有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 通过对齐判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，仅需少量判别样本就能进一步增强模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Result: 对多种基于LLM的方法评估表明，即使使用先进的自反思框架，综述生成任务仍然极具挑战性。

Conclusion: 综述生成任务复杂度高，需要持续研究，所有代码、数据和模型均已开源。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差严重影响长上下文理解能力，现有方法通过修改架构来缓解但效果有限，需要更有效的方法来解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill知识蒸馏框架，利用位置间固有差异来对抗位置偏差本身，设计了针对检索和推理的两种具体实现方案。

Result: 在长上下文检索和推理任务中，所有上下文位置都实现了更好的均匀性和显著性能提升，两种系统还展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill通过知识蒸馏有效缓解了位置偏差问题，在保持各自任务优异性能的同时实现了跨任务的相互泛化，为解决长上下文处理中的位置敏感性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孟加拉语作为全球第七大语言，由于资源有限和标注数据集缺乏而面临数字代表性不足的问题。词干提取作为语言分析的关键预处理步骤，对于像孟加拉语这样低资源、高屈折性的语言至关重要。

Method: 本文采用文献综述的方法，全面调查了现有的孟加拉语词干提取方法，分析现有研究的局限性和挑战。

Result: 研究发现孟加拉语词干提取领域存在显著的研究断层，可复现的实现稀缺，评估方法不够相关，且缺乏对丰富形态和方言多样性的有效处理。

Conclusion: 论文主张开发更强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，并持续进行研究以提升语言分析和处理能力，为低资源语言处理提供重要参考。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集规模有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解能力，还是可能引入冗余或降低性能

Method: 构建包含406,190样本和8,989,510图像的EcomMMMU数据集，包含8个核心任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性使用多图像进行下游任务

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低效果，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容进行电商任务方面存在困难

Conclusion: SUMEI方法通过数据驱动的方式策略性使用多图像，实验证明其有效性和鲁棒性，为电商多模态理解提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

Motivation: 解决医疗大语言模型在诊断中存在的知识鸿沟和幻觉问题，传统检索增强方法对外部知识利用不足且反馈推理可追溯性差。

Method: 构建大规模医学检索语料库（患者记录和可靠医学知识），将LLM作为核心代理，检索语料库作为环境，通过强化学习使用格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性等多维度奖励进行端到端训练。

Result: 在多个数据中心超越提示工程和无训练RAG方法，诊断准确性显著提升，优于GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1等强基线模型，在常见和罕见疾病诊断以及分布内外设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习训练的代理RAG系统能有效提升医疗诊断的准确性和可解释性，奖励设计和检索语料库组件对性能提升至关重要，为临床提供更可靠精确的初步诊断支持。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Method: 构建ReasonZoo基准测试包含9个推理类别，提出性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)两个新指标来评估推理效率

Result: TIR模型在数学和非数学任务中都优于非TIR模型，TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考，使推理更加精简

Conclusion: TIR具有领域通用的优势，有潜力提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这一长期选择，探索是否还有其他方法可以获得同等或更好的性能。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了Soft-argmax的使用，采用端到端的深度网络训练方法。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准数据集上实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度比传统方法快2.2倍，同时保持更好/有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax不是实现高性能面部关键点检测的唯一方法，基于结构化预测的替代方法在收敛速度和准确性方面都表现出优势，为相关研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得了显著改进，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了最先进方法，并通过交叉验证证实了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为图像分类提供了新视角，还拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的RGB-only解决方案来直接从类别级别学习9-DoF姿态估计。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越之前RGB-only方法，接近RGB-D系统性能。

Conclusion: YOPO证明可以在不使用额外数据的情况下，通过单阶段框架统一目标检测和9-DoF姿态估计，并达到高性能。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，仅需3-20个采样步骤即可从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，攻击成功率高且计算效率提升10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型对抗攻击存在图像质量低、计算资源需求大的问题，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百个采样步骤，需要开发更高效的对抗生成方法

Method: 通过在混合步骤区间注入扰动实现有效攻击，无需处理所有时间步；采用选择性RGB通道策略，对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型攻击ResNet成功率达70.6%，MNASNet达80.8%，ShuffleNet达97.8%；PSNR超过30dB保持视觉质量；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍

Conclusion: TAIGen实现了高效高质量的对抗图像生成，在保持视觉质量的同时显著提升了攻击效率和成功率，是最具影响力的攻击方法

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

TL;DR: 提出基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于在时空相关中断下保证多视角3D重建的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应急响应等关键应用需要近实时3D重建，但边缘环境的动态性和操作逆境会导致相机操作中断，影响重建质量

Method: 采用投资组合理论优化方法，使用遗传算法解决相机选择问题，以应对时空相关中断

Result: 在公开和定制3D数据集上验证，相比传统基线策略能更好保证重建可靠性

Conclusion: 所提出的投资组合理论方法能有效应对边缘环境中的时空相关中断，确保3D重建质量

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于mask域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在局限

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题并展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE模块（mask域可逆建模）、CARE模块（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE模块（Bernoulli扩散模型细化）

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算效率高

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络和生成式细化的协同作用，为CVP任务提供了新的解决方案，并建立了更鲁棒的bi-level优化框架

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Motivation: 现有整流流模型使用线性轨迹，可能迫使生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响语义对齐和指令遵循能力

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，将曲率指导直接融入流路径，采用曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变

Result: 在MS COCO数据集上达到SOTA性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模能显著增强模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量图像生成

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真上都表现出优秀的泛化能力。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量版HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和对齐学习，实现了优秀的图像质量评估泛化能力，无需参考图像或主观标签，为实时部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型的纹理生成问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景合成解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1）引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2）采用2D和3D辅助监督提升鲁棒性；3）基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Conclusion: TriMM成功证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的价值，为整合其他多模态数据集到3D生成中提供了可行性验证。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Conclusion: 该方法通过软原型计算和双重一致性学习，有效解决了类间冲突和原型漂移问题，提高了聚类性能。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable

Method: 提出双无人机协作框架AeroDuo：高空无人机集成多模态大语言模型(Pilot-LLM)进行目标推理，低空无人机采用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标定位，仅交换最小坐标信息确保效率。

Result: 构建了包含13,838条协作轨迹的HaL-13k数据集，包含未见地图和未见对象验证集，系统评估模型在新环境和陌生目标上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过高低空无人机协作，既利用了无人机的高机动性优势，又保持了导航任务的可学习性，为户外无人机视觉语言导航提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了跳过步采样机制，通过马尔可夫方式实现扩散模型的加速采样，证明这是预训练扩散模型的内在特性，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中达到SOTA效果，但其顺序生成过程需要多步迭代，采样效率低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程是否具有相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，在迭代生成过程中绕过多个中间去噪步骤，与传统逐步细化方法形成对比。该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标，证明通过马尔可夫方式加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样机制为扩散模型提供了一种高效的马尔可夫加速采样方法，可与DDIM等现有技术结合进一步提升生成效果，证明了原始扩散过程本身具有加速采样的内在能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像编解码器编码模式有限且依赖工程师手动选择，对非专业用户不友好，需要更智能的交互式压缩解决方案。

Method: 提出三创新：多功能编码框架统一不同编码模式；交互式编码代理使用增强上下文学习方法；建立首个专用基准测试IIC-bench。

Result: Comp-X能高效理解编码请求，具备出色的文本交互能力，在单一编码框架下保持可比压缩性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像压缩中的人工通用智能提供了有前景的途径，推动了图像编码范式的演进。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配结果进行监督，导致监督范围有限，拓扑推理性能不佳

Method: 重构Transformer解码器结构，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序，保留冗余车道预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，能无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Conclusion: 多模态方法在推进专利分析方面具有巨大潜力，DesignCLIP为设计专利应用提供了更可靠和准确的AI驱动分析框架。

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA是一个用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的框架，整合了时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心脏功能评估方面取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在图像噪声、探头位置变异性问题，且现有机器学习方法往往忽略时序信息、仅限于二元分类，缺乏预测校准。

Method: 提出时序提示对齐(TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取帧特征，可训练时序提取器聚合特征捕获心脏运动，并使用边界铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别特定文本提示。引入条件变分自编码器风格调制(CVAESM)模块学习潜在风格向量来调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: 在CHD检测私有数据集上达到85.40%的宏观F1分数，同时将预期校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%。在EchoNet-Dynamic三分类任务上，宏观F1提升4.73%(从53.89%到58.62%)。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的准确性和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 传统多摄像头系统受限于2D视频数据和复杂3D重建处理，难以实现实时分析。篮球运动中10名球员在有限场地内快速复杂移动，频繁遮挡使得追踪极具挑战

Method: 构建BasketLiDAR多模态数据集（4445帧，3105个球员ID），同步3个LiDAR传感器和3个多视角摄像头。开发新型MOT算法：单独使用LiDAR的实时追踪管道，以及融合LiDAR和摄像头数据的多模态追踪管道

Conclusion: LiDAR的高精度3D空间信息能有效解决篮球运动中的复杂追踪问题，多模态融合方法在保持精度的同时实现实时性能，为体育分析提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法需要大量训练和计算资源，基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示但手动生成成本高，需要一种无需训练且高效的方法。

Method: 将COD解耦为两个阶段：1）RAG阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库生成粗掩码提示；2）SEG阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。完全无需传统训练。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上达到或超越最先进方法的性能，所有实验在个人笔记本上完成，证明了计算效率和实用性。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种训练免费的COD解决方案，通过检索增强和SAM分割的结合，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全问题，这些模型可能在未经授权的情况下使用个人身份、艺术创作和有害材料进行训练，导致不良内容的无控制生产和传播。

Method: 提出VideoEraser框架，采用两阶段过程：1）选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）来修改文本嵌入；2）抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG）来增强去噪过程中的对抗鲁棒性。该框架无需训练，可即插即用地集成到现有T2V扩散模型中。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制T2V生成过程中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型可能被滥用于生成有害或误导性内容的问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

TL;DR: BioTune是一种进化自适应微调技术，通过进化算法选择性地微调特定层，提高迁移学习效率，在多个图像分类数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像分析中取得显著进展，但大型全训练模型的计算需求仍然是一个问题。传统微调方法需要更新所有参数，容易导致过拟合和计算成本高。

Method: 提出BioTune技术，使用进化算法识别需要微调的层集合，专注于相关层的微调过程，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法，实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 通过集中微调过程在相关层子集上，BioTune降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 提出图像条件化高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用共享码本消除逐场景码本开销，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练

Result: 实验结果表明ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了压缩效率，提供了归档后场景变化的适应能力，为3D场景的长期归档提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景，现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态静态组件时忽略了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，为驾驶场景的高质量重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Method: 采用因果链模型视角系统分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计DIO基准模型网络结构，并逐步提出三种改进方法来充分学习预定义的人类推理逻辑。

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的优化目标（最大化上下文与正确选项的互信息变分下界）无法让模型真正掌握人类推理逻辑，需要通过改进方法来克服互信息最大化的界限性。

Conclusion: 需要通过更有效的方法来克服传统互信息最大化方法的局限性，以便模型真正掌握人类抽象推理的因果关系。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 短视频内容兴起需要高效的关键信息提取技术，但现有方法难以捕捉全局时序依赖、保持语义连贯性，且多通道特征融合易受噪声影响

Method: 基于脉冲神经网络的关键帧提取器、动态聚合图推理器进行细粒度推理、变分推理重建模块处理特征融合不确定性，使用ELBO优化和后验分布正则化

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum、QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法

Conclusion: SpiVG网络能有效提升信息密度、降低计算复杂度，解决视频摘要中的关键挑战

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: 尽管MAE作为视觉基础模型的强大预训练技术很有效，但在应用于新数据集时需要大量超参数调优（掩码比例、补丁大小、编码器/解码器层数），而MAE超参数与下游任务性能之间的关系尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，并将分析扩展到非线性MAE，研究MAE如何适应数据集中的空间相关性。

Result: 研究表明掩码比例和补丁大小可以选择捕获不同范围空间相关性的特征，MAE表示能够适应数据集中的空间相关性，超越二阶统计量。

Conclusion: 论文提供了关于如何在实际中选择MAE超参数的一些见解，为MAE超参数调优提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: 双向时间信息传播策略能有效利用全局和局部时间信息，实现红外小目标检测的联合优化和高效推理

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，为该任务提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了极稀疏视角下的3D场景重建问题，无需SfM初始化，在渲染质量和几何结构重建方面均取得显著提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个用于多模态图像融合的新框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习，解决了模态不对齐、高频细节破坏等问题，在多个融合任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像融合面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合方法来提升图像质量和下游应用效果。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行跨域融合，实现空间和频率域的高效多模态融合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，有效提升了多模态图像融合的质量和通用性，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的完整框架，结合了几何和生成先验，通过创新的Road Surface Gaussian表示和自监督不确定性估计，显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从记录的行车日志合成外推视图对于自动驾驶模拟至关重要，但现有方法使用生成先验作为伪真值往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，核心包括基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示、使用可学习缩放因子的Far Field Gaussians处理远距离物体，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性地集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为高质量的驾驶模拟提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程处理多对象交互和复杂运动，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。第一阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；第二阶段使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)预测组特定位移场，并整合文本到视频模型的先验知识，通过上下文条件特征增强(CCFE)等模块提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成高质量、时间一致的复杂多对象草图动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法有效解决了多对象交互和复杂运动的动画生成问题，扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个用于高分辨率遥感影像中细粒度窄路分割的网络，通过差分注意力膨胀提取、双流解码融合机制和多尺度膨胀策略，在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感影像中窄路提取的挑战，包括宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和频繁遮挡等问题。传统模型容易对通用道路宽度过拟合，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力膨胀提取模块增强细粒度道路特征；2）双流解码融合机制整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度膨胀策略（1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件似然，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1) 依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2) 缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，影响决策边界可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将TTA重新定义为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐步更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来校正可能存在的似然偏差。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完全访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过邻居感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，引导INR模型早期关注高频细节，有效缓解频谱偏置问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏置问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理。现有方法主要通过架构修改或特殊激活函数来解决，本文提出通过直接指导训练过程的新方向。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）使用邻居感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，引导模型早期关注高频细节；2）过渡到全图像训练。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法 consistently 改善重建质量，并能与现有INR方法互补。

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，本工作为解决频谱偏置问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的半定规划松弛方法求解截断最小二乘配准问题需要数百秒，计算效率低下，需要更快速的全局最优求解方法。

Method: 使用线性时间凸松弛和收缩器方法加速分支定界算法，在给定旋转轴的情况下求解点云配准问题。

Result: 能够在0.5秒内求解100个点的3D点云配准问题，比STRIDE SDP求解器快两个数量级，并提供全局最优性证明。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准的计算效率，虽然目前仅适用于旋转轴已知的情况，但在该限制条件下实现了突破性的速度提升。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得显著进展，但在时间感知方面仍然粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码、帧级特征连续性捕捉能力弱、语言视觉对齐容易偏离关注实体。

Method: 1) 扩散时序潜在(DTL)编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2) 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3) 混合标记方案使用离散时间标记提供显式时间戳建模

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中达到最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三大关键技术创新，为视频LLM提供了强大的接地能力，实现了细粒度的时间推理和精确的时间感知

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据的树木实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但面临数据变异大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，人类操作员进行质量评级，训练评级模型分类分割输出，最后用评级模型反馈微调分割模型

Result: 原始分割模型在正确识别树木实例方面提升了34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了树木分割性能，但在稀疏林区小树木（低于2米）和复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中仍存在挑战，性能有所下降

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发无需目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于不同DNN架构使用一致关键特征的观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏可能被多种架构采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移能力，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD通过知识蒸馏成功实现了从多模态模型到纯视觉模型的有效知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线地图构建解决方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了MDPR框架，通过多维动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，消融研究证实了语义库对尾部类别的有效性

Conclusion: MDPR是一个灵活高效的VLM微调增强框架，动态路由计算开销极小，能有效处理数据不平衡问题

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要提前编码整个视觉上下文或预先知道问题，不适用于长视频理解和多轮对话场景。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，并维护固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮对话提供了一种高效的内存压缩解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

TL;DR: WorldWeaver是一个用于生成长视频的框架，通过联合建模RGB帧和感知条件，显著提升了时间一致性和运动动态，减少了长期视频生成中的漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积误差，需要解决时间一致性和结构保持的问题。

Method: 提出统一的长时域建模方案，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在扩散模型和整流流模型上的大量实验表明，WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移，提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过多模态联合建模和创新的训练策略，为长视频生成提供了更稳健的解决方案，显著改善了时间一致性和视觉质量。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Conclusion: 减少标注工作量，将精确生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限环境，推动医学诊断和病理图像分析自动化

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个从60万高分辨率扫描数据学习的高保真人体模型，通过将网格表示基于人体骨骼来显式解耦形状和骨骼基，解决了现有方法在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且传统方法中内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题性依赖关系。

Method: 使用240个同步相机捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据学习，显式解耦形状和骨骼基，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体方面更准确，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: 该方法通过骨骼基础的解耦实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

TL;DR: VAREdit是一个基于视觉自回归模型的图像编辑框架，通过多尺度特征预测和尺度对齐参考模块，解决了扩散模型在指令引导编辑中的全局纠缠问题，实现了更精确的编辑效果和更高的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在指令引导图像编辑中存在全局去噪过程导致编辑区域与整个图像上下文纠缠的问题，会产生意外的伪修改和编辑指令遵循度不足。自回归模型因其因果和组合机制能够自然规避这些问题。

Method: 提出VAREdit框架，将图像编辑重新定义为下一尺度预测问题。通过源图像特征和文本指令条件化，生成多尺度目标特征。引入尺度对齐参考(SAR)模块，在第一个自注意力层注入尺度匹配的条件信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GPT-Balance分数比领先的基于扩散的方法高出30%以上。512×512图像编辑仅需1.2秒，比同等规模的UltraEdit快2.2倍。

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归范式和多尺度对齐机制，在编辑精度和效率方面都取得了显著进步，为指令引导图像编辑提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在提升样本质量的同时最大化组内多样性，解决了独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中用户通常需要一组多个输出样本，但传统生成模型的独立采样会导致结果冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，选择子集以优化样本质量（一元项）同时最大化组多样性（二元项）。采用渐进式候选集剪枝提高运行效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比独立采样基线和近期推理算法，显著提升了组多样性和质量，适用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更丰富的输出选择。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Method: 针对两种视频生成架构的不同问题，提出了专门的变体方法，基于开源视频生成框架实现高分辨率I2V和V2V合成

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展图像和视频模型高分辨率生成能力方面的优越性，实现了无需微调的8K图像生成和仅需最小LoRA微调的4K视频生成

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的高频信息增加和重复模式问题，显著提升了生成质量

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次解决空间范围连接随机采样问题，提出了一种时间和空间效率都很高的算法，能够在不执行完整连接操作的情况下获得随机样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间范围连接在许多应用中应用广泛，但计算成本高且结果集太大。通过随机采样可以有效缓解这些问题，但直接执行连接操作再采样效率低下。

Method: 首先设计了两种基准算法，然后提出了一种新的数据结构，能够在预期时间复杂度为$	ilde{O}(n + m + t)$和空间复杂度为$O(n+m)$的情况下处理该问题。

Result: 使用四个真实空间数据集进行了广泛实验，结果表明在大多数测试中，新算法的速度显著快于基准算法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了空间范围连接随机采样的效率问题，提出的算法在时间和空间效率方面都有显著优势，为相关应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information
systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and
visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but
also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating
these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is
promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins,
efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must
obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this
challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and
space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ
existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient.
Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in
$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are
the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We
conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in
most tests.

Motivation: 时序图中查询凝聚子图对于理解真实网络的动态结构至关重要，现有OTCD算法在可扩展性方面存在限制，无法有效处理组合增长的区间枚举和重复计算

Method: CoreT算法动态记录每个顶点或边进入k-core的最早时间戳，通过剪枝冗余计算，仅需单次遍历查询区间

Result: 实验结果表明CoreT在大型真实数据集上比OTCD快4个数量级，时间复杂性与查询区间内的时序边数量和区间长度呈线性关系

Conclusion: CoreT算法显著提升了时序k-core查询的效率和可扩展性，特别适合长期时序分析

Abstract: Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding
the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in
social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient
communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the
temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all
possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art
algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals
by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time
intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the
combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this
paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel
algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each
vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of
redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the
query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both
the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the
interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.
Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up
to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art
OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core
analysis.

generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决云边端协作查询处理中，边缘资源瓶颈导致查询性能下降的问题，实现查询执行在云端和边缘之间灵活切换

Method: 构建基于协作扫描运算符的云边端协作框架，允许在边缘资源饱和时将查询执行转移到云端

Result: 在充足网络下载带宽时，协作扫描运算符能有效缓解高I/O负载和CPU等待时间导致的性能下降，实现云边资源均衡调度

Conclusion: 该方法通过协作扫描运算符实现了云边端查询执行的无缝切换，有效提升了查询性能和资源利用效率

Abstract: In cloud-edge-device (CED) collaborative query (CQ) processing, by leveraging
CED collaboration, the advantages of both cloud computing and edge resources
can be fully integrated. However, it is difficult to implement collaborative
operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query
execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when
the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query
execution between the cloud and edge, we propose a CQ processing method by
establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan
operator, so that query execution can be transferred to the cloud at any time
when the edge resources are saturated. Extensive experiments show that, under
sufficient network download bandwidth, the CED collaborative scan operator can
effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by
high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge. It also achieves balanced resource
scheduling between the cloud and edge.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Gorgeous系统通过优先处理图结构而非向量数据，优化了基于SSD的向量搜索性能，显著提升了查询吞吐量和降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SSD的向量搜索系统存在数据布局不佳的问题，无法有效利用内存空间减少磁盘访问，且磁盘数据访问局部性差。研究发现图结构索引比向量本身访问更频繁，但现有系统未区分两者。

Method: 设计Gorgeous系统，采用图结构优先原则：1）内存缓存图节点的邻接表以提高缓存命中率；2）磁盘块格式显式存储邻居邻接表与向量以增强数据局部性。

Result: 实验显示Gorgeous持续优于两个最先进的基于磁盘的向量搜索系统，平均查询吞吐量提升超过60%，查询延迟降低超过35%。

Conclusion: 通过优先处理图结构索引并优化数据布局，Gorgeous系统有效解决了大规模向量数据集搜索的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a
key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce
costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a
proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the
state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered
by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory
space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing
disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the
structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the
vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two. To
address this problem, we design the Gorgeous system with the principle of
prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a
memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache
hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists
along with a vector to enhance data locality. Experimental results show that
Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for
vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query
latency by over 35%.

TL;DR: GoVector是一种针对磁盘图索引的I/O高效缓存策略，通过静态缓存和动态缓存结合，以及磁盘节点重排序，显著减少I/O操作并提升查询性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图索引在磁盘存储时面临I/O瓶颈问题，静态缓存策略在查询第二阶段无法有效处理查询依赖节点的动态访问需求

Method: 结合静态缓存（存储入口点和频繁访问邻居）和动态缓存（自适应捕获空间局部性高的节点），并通过磁盘节点重排序使相似向量共置同一页面

Result: 在90%召回率下，平均减少46% I/O操作，查询吞吐量提升1.73倍，查询延迟降低42%

Conclusion: GoVector通过创新的缓存策略和存储布局优化，有效解决了磁盘图索引的I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了大规模近似最近邻搜索的性能

Abstract: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution
for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their
substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where
frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the
dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static
caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by
preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second
phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high
recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for
disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores
entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that
adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search
phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,
GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the
same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves
substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations
by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query
latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

TL;DR: Databelt是一个面向3D计算连续体动态环境的无服务器工作流状态管理框架，通过SLO感知状态传播和函数状态融合机制，显著降低状态访问延迟和网络开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无服务器函数依赖远程存储服务管理状态，在3D计算连续体（边缘-云-空间）动态环境中面临网络拓扑频繁变化、高延迟状态访问和不必要数据传输等问题

Method: Databelt引入SLO感知状态传播机制，主动将函数状态卸载到最合适的节点；采用函数状态融合机制，为共享相同运行时的函数抽象状态管理，减少冗余网络和存储操作

Result: 实验结果显示，Databelt将工作流执行时间减少高达66%，吞吐量提高50%；函数状态融合将存储操作延迟降低高达20%

Conclusion: Databelt通过创新的状态管理机制，有效解决了动态网络环境中无服务器工作流的性能问题，确保了3D计算连续体中工作流的高效执行

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

TL;DR: 本文证明了在LUMI模型和顺序调度器下，机器人群体可以从任意初始配置执行任意模式序列的通用舞蹈问题，突破了现有工作的限制条件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作证明舞蹈问题需要满足模式重复、周期性、对称性等严格约束条件才能解决。本文旨在探索如何通过LUMI模型和顺序调度器来消除这些必要约束

Method: 利用LUMI模型中机器人带有恒定大小颜色调色板的灯光，在顺序调度器下实现分布式计数器机制，设计算法解决通用舞蹈问题

Result: 证明了在LUMI模型下，可行舞蹈序列的长度受限于机器人可用颜色数量的n的组合，并提供了确保空间同质性的算法

Conclusion: LUMI模型和顺序调度器的结合使得通用舞蹈问题得以解决，突破了传统模型的限制，为机器人群体执行任意模式序列提供了新方法

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

TL;DR: 本文提出了同步消息传递系统中k-set协议的新下界，推广了先前在完整网络和任意无向通信网络中的相关结果，基于拓扑证明方法并引入了可壳载体映射技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有k-set协议下界主要针对完整网络或特定网络拓扑，缺乏对任意有向通信网络和t个进程崩溃情况的通用下界分析，需要开发更一般的理论框架。

Method: 采用拓扑证明方法，基于可壳载体映射序列，在前t/k轮使用每轮崩溃k个进程的载体映射保持高连通性，之后使用新型载体映射维持连通性，并结合Sperner引理式论证。

Result: 建立了任意有向通信网络中k-set协议的同步下界，推广了多个现有结果，并证明了基于Kuhn三角化的指数级更小输入复形的可用性。

Conclusion: 该工作为分布式系统中k-set协议提供了更通用的下界理论，拓扑证明方法具有扩展性，新输入复形设计显著降低了复杂度。

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested

Motivation: 在无服务器环境中，工作流中的函数可能被调度到不同节点的不同缓存上，这会导致非直观的异常。现有缓存方案无法很好地处理客户端漫游场景

Method: 提出了CausalMesh系统，采用因果一致性缓存协议，支持客户端在多服务器间漫游时的无协调操作。使用Dafny对协议进行了形式化验证

Result: 实验评估显示CausalMesh比现有方案具有更低的延迟和更高的吞吐量

Conclusion: CausalMesh是第一个支持客户端漫游环境下无协调、无中止读写操作和读事务的缓存系统，为无服务器工作流提供了有效的状态管理解决方案

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing
and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold
great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across
various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce
network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face
significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type
communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and
hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel
space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that
seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial
networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN
and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable
sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical
background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of
SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline
monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based
on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as
underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF)
configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results
evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time
allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the
operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean
mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for
SAGUIN.

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了在5G网络中，现代主动队列管理(AQM)策略如RED和L4S对QUIC协议上视频流媒体验质量(QoE)的影响，尤其重点研究了它们与5G网络中无线链路控制(RLC)缓冲区、拥塞控制算法和适配性码率(ABR)方案之间的复杂交互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G网络的普及，4K及更高分辨率视频流媒成为可能，但在移动网络中优化用户体验质量仍面临挑战。传统研究多独立分析各层组件，而实际上应用层ABR方案、传输屢拥塞控制算法以及5G网络中的无线链路控制(RLC)队列存在复杂的跨层交互。

Method: 进行了一个综合性分析，重点研究现代主动队列管理(AQM)策略（如RED和L4S）在多种QUIC实现上对视频流媒的影响，特别关注它们与5G环境中RLC缓冲区的交互以及拥塞控制算法与ABR方案之间的相互作用。

Result: 研究发现，AQM策略在改善视频流媒QoE方面的效果与其与QUIC实现、拥塞控制算法和ABR方案的动态交互密切相关，说明独立的优化方法是不充分的。

Conclusion: 这种复杂的相互依存关系必须通过整体性的跨层适应机制来实现，这些机制能够在网络、传输和应用层之间进行实时协调，对于充分发挥5G网络的潜力以提供稳健、适应性强和高质量的视频流媒服务至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of QUIC as a transport protocol has transformed content
delivery by reducing latency, enhancing congestion control (CC), and enabling
more efficient multiplexing. With the advent of 5G networks, which support
ultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and
beyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of
Experience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex
interactions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC
algorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the
link layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these
components in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the
impact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S,
on video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations--focusing particularly on
their interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay
between CC algorithms and ABR schemes. Our findings demonstrate that the
effectiveness of AQM strategies in improving video streaming QoE is
intrinsically linked to their dynamic interaction with QUIC implementations, CC
algorithms and ABR schemes-highlighting that isolated optimizations are
insufficient. This intricate interdependence necessitates holistic, cross-layer
adaptive mechanisms capable of real-time coordination between network,
transport and application layers, which are crucial for fully leveraging the
capabilities of 5G networks to deliver robust, adaptive, and high-quality video
streaming.

Abstract: Future communication networks are expected to achieve deep integration of
communication, sensing, and computation, forming a tightly coupled and
autonomously operating infrastructure system. However, current reliance on
centralized control, static design, and human intervention continues to
constrain the multidimensional evolution of network functions and applications,
limiting adaptability and resilience in large-scale, layered, and complex
environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
nature-inspired architectural framework that leverages digital twin technology
to organize connected devices at the edge into functional digital populations,
while enabling the emergence of an evolvable digital ecosystem through
multi-population integration at the cloud. We believe that this framework,
which combines engineering methodologies with sociotechnical insights, lays the
theoretical foundation for building next-generation communication networks with
dynamic coordination, distributed decision-making, continuous adaptation, and
evolutionary capabilities.

Abstract: The network structure design plays a vital role in the mega-constellation
network (MSN) to coordinate massive network nodes to ensure the effectiveness
and reliability of operations and services for future space wireless
communications networks.
  One of the critical issues in MCN is how to design an optimal network control
structure by configuring the most stable inter-satellite link (ISL) to achieve
high available MCN within a limited average transmission delays.
  To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel MCN structure design
paradigm: Structure = Motif + Lattice (SML), which decouples MCN design into
local motifs design and global lattices design. Specifically, we formulate the
High-Availability and Low-Latency Mega-Constellation Design (HALLMD) problem,
aimed at maximizing ISL availability while minimizing the transmission latency.
To solve HALLMD, we propose SMLOP, a heuristic algorithm that efficiently finds
optimal network structures in polynomial time. Experimental validation on four
public state-of-the-art constellations demonstrates significant improvements,
including enhanced capacity by $5\sim 18\%$, increased throughput by $1\sim
12\%$, reduced path stretch by $12\sim 23\%$, and Round-Trip Time (RTT) by
$8\sim 77\%$.

TL;DR: 一种基于大语言模型的多代理框架，通过匹配代理和代码生成代理自动生成网络控制接口，解决传统标准接口的兼容性和灵活性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标准化网络接口存在厂商特定不兼容、设计偏确和缺乏适应新功能的问题，需要一种更灵活的接口生成方案。

Method: 提出一种多代理框架：匹配代理负责将控制功能与网络功能能力对齐，代码生成代理负责生成API服务器来实现接口。基于大语言模型实现。

Result: 在多厂商gNB和WLAN AP环境中验证了方案，性能评估显示了不同LLM在接口生成任务中成本与延迟的批搂。

Conclusion: 为AI原生动态控制接口生成奠定了基础，为未来移动网络的更好互操性和适应性抓平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional standardized network interfaces face significant limitations,
including vendor-specific incompatibilities, rigid design assumptions, and lack
of adaptability for new functionalities. We propose a multi-agent framework
leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate control interfaces on
demand between network functions (NFs). This includes a matching agent, which
aligns required control functionalities with NF capabilities, and a
code-generation agent, which generates the necessary API server for interface
realization. We validate our approach using simulated multi-vendor gNB and WLAN
AP environments. The performance evaluations highlight the trade-offs between
cost and latency across LLMs for interface generation tasks. Our work sets the
foundation for AI-native dynamic control interface generation, paving the way
for enhanced interoperability and adaptability in future mobile networks.

*Ziteng Wang,Ruijie Fang,Linus Zheng,Dixin Tang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的同态形计算法，用于验证和拒绝用户定义聚合函数是否满足同态形性质，以支持高效的并行执行和增量计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然数据处理框架如Spark和Flink支持用户定义聚合函数，但要实现高效执行，函数必须满足同态形性质，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的同态形计算法，这种计算法既能验证也能拒绝UDAF是否为数据框同态形。如果满足条件，还能构造相应的合并运算符。

Result: 实现了基于该计算法的算法，并在真实世界的UDAF上进行了评估，结果显示该方法显著地超过了两个领先的合成器。

Conclusion: 该同态形计算法为验证和构造高效聚合函数提供了一种有效的方法，能够支持并行执行和增量计算，在性能上显著超过现有方案。

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

TL;DR: GPS是一种新的软件模型检测算法，结合了静态分析和测试生成，通过两层搜索策略高效发现程序错误，在SV-COMP基准测试中优于现有最先进工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件模型检测工具在处理包含长输入相关错误路径的程序时效率不高，需要一种能够同时保证安全证明和错误发现效率的新方法。

Method: GPS采用基于组合静态分析的摘要技术来指导程序状态的有向搜索，使用静态分析摘要剪枝不可行路径并驱动测试生成，采用新颖的两层搜索策略和插装技术实现反驳完备性。

Result: 在SV-COMP和文献基准测试中，GPS在解决基准数量和运行时间方面都优于最先进的软件模型检测器，特别是在ReachSafety-Loops类别中表现突出。

Conclusion: GPS通过结合静态分析和测试生成的混合方法，有效解决了长错误路径程序的模型检测问题，实现了高效的安全证明和错误发现能力。

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为big-stop semantics的扩展大步语义方法，通过归纳定义捕获发散计算，无需引入错误状态，保持了大步语义的简洁性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大步语义虽然简洁易用，但无法描述程序发散行为，而小步语义虽然强大但规则复杂。需要找到既能保持大步语义简洁性又能处理发散计算的解决方案。

Method: 扩展标准大步推理规则，添加少量额外规则来定义等价于小步转换自反传递闭包的评估判断，使用归纳定义而非共归纳。

Result: 成功为类型化、非类型化和带效应的PCF变体以及基于while循环的命令式语言实现了big-stop语义，证明其与小步语义等价。

Conclusion: big-stop semantics提供了一种简洁有效的方法来扩展大步语义以处理发散计算，相比其他解决方案更易于理解和应用。

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

TL;DR: Praline是Datalog的新扩展，用于在输入存在统计相关性时进行精确概率推理，通过约束优化和高效算法提供紧致的概率边界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率逻辑编程语言（如ProbLog）在处理输入事实间的统计相关性方面存在不足，无法准确评估输出关系的概率

Method: 将推理任务表述为约束优化问题，提出δ-精确推理算法，结合约束求解、静态分析和迭代优化来提高可扩展性

Result: 在包括侧信道分析在内的真实基准测试中，该方法不仅具有良好可扩展性，还能提供紧致的概率边界

Conclusion: Praline有效解决了输入相关性下的概率推理问题，为复杂应用场景提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Core ECS的形式化模型，用于抽象ECS模式的核心本质，识别出一类确定性并发程序，并发现现有ECS框架未能充分利用确定性并发机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECS模式在游戏开发中广泛应用，具有并发性、模块化和性能优势，但现有解释往往局限于具体框架细节或使用不完美的隐喻，缺乏对模式本质的严谨理解。

Method: 设计Core ECS形式化模型，抽象具体实现细节，识别确定性行为的程序类别，并调研多个现实世界ECS框架进行比较分析。

Result: 发现了一类无论调度如何都能保持确定性的Core ECS程序，现有ECS框架都未能充分利用确定性并发的机会。

Conclusion: 研究指出了新的ECS实现技术空间，可以更好地利用确定性并发机会，为构建确定性并发编程模型提供了基础。

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

Conclusion: 成功将顺序程序的分级类型技术与同步会话的公平终止技术结合，为资源感知主动对象模型提供了形式化基础

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

Motivation: 现有的组合符号执行工具虽然利用了分离逻辑进行组合验证和错误分离逻辑进行组合错误查找，但缺乏对内存模型参数化平台的满意形式化基础。Gillian平台显示自定义内存模型能提供灵活性，但需要更好的理论基础。

Method: 基于Gillian的启发，在Rocq交互式定理证明器中机械化形式化基础，并通过实例化到多种内存模型（包括C和CHERI）进行验证，同时支持分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为内存模型参数化的组合符号执行平台提供了坚实的形式化基础，支持多种内存模型和两种分析类型，确保了与其他基于标准定义工具的互操作性。

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在纯符号设置中有效，但在神经符号程序合成中由于神经网络组件的误预测会导致返回错误程序。需要开发能够处理神经网络误预测挑战的新方法。

Method: 提出基于约束符合性评估(CCE)的新方法，CCE考虑神经网络误预测并整合用户反馈。该方法迭代地提高CCE精度，直到所有剩余程序保证观察等价。

Result: 在三个神经符号领域实验评估显示，SmartLabel在98%的基准测试中识别出真实程序，平均只需不到5轮用户交互。相比之下，先前技术最多只能在65%的基准测试中收敛到真实程序。

Conclusion: 所提出的SmartLabel方法有效解决了神经符号程序合成中主动学习的独特挑战，显著提高了识别真实程序的成功率并减少了用户交互需求。

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个全面的APR工具评估框架，并以Sorald工具为例进行评估，发现虽然能修复特定规则违规，但会引入新缺陷、降低功能正确性和代码结构质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估APR工具清除违规的能力，忽视了其可能引入新违规、改变代码功能和降低代码结构质量的问题，需要开发全面的评估框架。

Method: 以Sorald工具为案例研究，评估其在2,393个Java代码片段中修复3,529个SonarQube违规的效果，分析修复后的代码质量变化。

Result: Sorald修复了特定规则违规，但引入了2,120个新缺陷（32个bug，2,088个代码异味），单元测试失败率达24%，代码结构质量下降。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够全面捕捉APR工具所有影响的评估方法，包括副作用，以确保其安全有效的应用。

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个分类法和八条指南，以解决大语言模型在软件工程研究中的可复现性和可重现性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的非确定性、训练数据不透明和演进架构为软件工程研究的可复现性和可重现性带来挑战，需要制定相应的研究规范。

Method: 通过社区合作开发了一个分类法，将LLM基础研究分类，并提出了八条设计和报告实证研究的指南，包括必需和希望标准。

Result: 研究提出了一个在线生态资源(llm-guidelines.org)，为社区提供了一个持续发展的指南框架，以支持更好的研究实践。

Conclusion: 这些指南能够在面对LLM特有障碍的情况下，促进软件工程研究的可复现性和可重现性，推动开放科学。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: QUPER-MAn模型将可维护性从被忽视的开发后果转变为主动管理的目标，通过基准测试和目标设定支持需求工程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可维护性在软件开发中至关重要但往往被忽视，需求工程可以通过促进讨论和设定适当目标来解决这个问题

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，开发了QUPER-MAn模型（QUPER模型的可维护性适配版本），整合可维护性基准并支持目标设定

Result: 研究发现可维护性仍然是次要质量关注点，明确需求通常只泛泛提及编码规范，工具虽然常见但仅用于隐式需求

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn模型能够通过知情和负责任的工程决策，将可维护性转变为主动管理的目标

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

TL;DR: VERMEI是一种新的FPGA逻辑综合工具测试方法，通过识别僵尸逻辑、等效变异和差分测试来发现工具缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FPGA逻辑综合工具中的缺陷可能导致意外行为和安全风险，现有测试方法存在语义和逻辑复杂性不足的问题

Method: 包含预处理（识别僵尸逻辑）、等效变异（通过贝叶斯采样在僵尸区域修剪或插入逻辑片段生成等效变体）、错误识别（基于差分测试比较合成输出）三个模块

Result: 在Yosys、Vivado和Quartus上的实验表明VERMEI优于现有方法，5个月内报告了15个bug，其中9个被确认为新bug

Conclusion: VERMEI能有效测试FPGA逻辑综合工具，生成具有复杂控制流和结构的测试程序，显著提高了bug检测能力

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

TL;DR: 通过动作研究在IT公司建立技术债务管理过程，应用工作坊概念，实现了可持续的过程改进和技术债务意识提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术债务管理在研究中常见但实践中采用少，需要在实际IT环境中建立可行的TDM过程。

Method: 采用动作研究方法（16个月内五个行动周期），通过问卷调查、团队会议观察、TD-SAGAT意识测量和背调数据分析来评估技术债务意识。

Result: 实践者偏好优先缴付成本低的"低垂果"技术债务，背调项中的提醒机制有效提升了技术债务意识。

Conclusion: 工作坊基于方法可行且能实现可持续过程改进，推出了新的TDM实践如重提交日期、TD讨论复选框和可视化优先级等方法。

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

timely detect their occurrences, localize the sources of the problems, and
implement the appropriate countermeasures. This paper reports our experience
with a state-of-the-art failure prediction method, PREVENT, and its extension
with a troubleshooting module, REACT, applied to naval systems developed by
Fincantieri. Our results show how to integrate anomaly detection with
troubleshooting procedures. We conclude by discussing a lesson learned, which
may help deploy and extend these analyses to other industrial products.

TL;DR: 本文研究具有组结构的面板数据模型，重点分析存在渐近可忽略的小组时最小二乘估计量和信息准则的渐近行为，提出了改进的信息准则来处理小组问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在处理面板数据分组模型时，往往忽略小组的存在。当存在相对规模渐近可忽略的小组时，传统的信息准则可能不一致或表现不佳，需要开发新的方法来准确识别小组结构。

Method: 推导最小二乘估计量的一致性和渐近正态性的充分条件；分析现有信息准则在小组存在时的局限性；提出改进的信息准则（MIC）来更好地处理小组问题；通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证有限样本性能。

Result: 证明了最小二乘估计量在特定条件下的统计性质；发现传统信息准则在小组存在时可能不一致；提出的MIC准则在模拟中表现良好；K-means聚类结合MIC能够有效发现小组而不产生过多分组。

Conclusion: 小组的存在需要更长的样本期来保证估计质量；改进的信息准则MIC能够有效处理小组识别问题；该方法能够在简约的分组结构中准确表征小组并将其与大队区分开来。

Abstract: We consider panel data models with group structure. We study the asymptotic
behavior of least-squares estimators and information criterion for the number
of groups, allowing for the presence of small groups that have an
asymptotically negligible relative size. Our contributions are threefold.
First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the least-squares estimators
are consistent and asymptotically normal. One of the conditions implies that a
longer sample period is required as there are smaller groups. Second, we show
that information criteria for the number of groups proposed in earlier works
can be inconsistent or perform poorly in the presence of small groups. Third,
we propose modified information criteria (MIC) designed to perform well in the
presence of small groups. A Monte Carlo simulation confirms their good
performance in finite samples. An empirical application illustrates that
K-means clustering paired with the proposed MIC allows one to discover small
groups without producing too many groups. This enables characterizing small
groups and differentiating them from the other large groups in a parsimonious
group structure.

TL;DR: 提出基于多元分布函数的多变量分位数回归新框架MQR，通过条件概率结构定义分位数，使用顺序单变量分位数回归构建多元分位数曲线，具有直观解释和灵活估计边际效应的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多变量分位数回归方法（如方向分位数、向量分位数回归或copula方法）存在局限性，需要一种基于联合条件分布函数条件概率结构的新框架来更直观地定义和估计多元分位数。

Method: 通过条件机制推导顺序单变量分位数回归来构建多元分位数曲线，建立MQR的理论基础包括估计量的渐近性质。

Result: 模拟实验显示该估计量在不同依赖结构下具有稳健的有限样本性能，实证应用分析了阿根廷2004-2024年汇率传递效应。

Conclusion: MQR框架为多元分位数回归提供了新的方法论基础，在理论和实证应用中都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for multivariate quantile regression
based on the multivariate distribution function, termed multivariate quantile
regression (MQR). In contrast to existing approaches--such as directional
quantiles, vector quantile regression, or copula-based methods--MQR defines
quantiles through the conditional probability structure of the joint
conditional distribution function. The method constructs multivariate quantile
curves using sequential univariate quantile regressions derived from
conditioning mechanisms, allowing for an intuitive interpretation and flexible
estimation of marginal effects. The paper develops theoretical foundations of
MQR, including asymptotic properties of the estimators. Through simulation
exercises, the estimator demonstrates robust finite sample performance across
different dependence structures. As an empirical application, the MQR framework
is applied to the analysis of exchange rate pass-through in Argentina from 2004
to 2024.

Method: 采用多方法稳健方法处理内生性和选择偏误，包括熵平衡、倾向得分匹配(PSM)和Heckman检验校正，研究对象为2014-2022年FTSE全股指数567家上市公司

Result: 发现环保创新与盈余管理存在正向关联，财务约束(低Whited-Wu分数和弱销售表现)和高财务不透明度的企业更倾向于进行盈余管理

Conclusion: 环保创新具有双重战略作用——在可持续性信号传递和盈余管理之间取得平衡，研究结果为监管机构、投资者和政策制定者在企业透明度、财务健康和环保责任交叉领域提供了可行见解

Abstract: Our research investigates the relationship between eco-innovation and
earnings management among 567 firms listed on the FTSE All-Share Index from
2014 to 2022. By examining how sustainability-driven innovation influences
financial reporting practices, we explore the strategic motivations behind
income smoothing in firms engaged in environmental initiatives. The findings
reveal a positive association between eco-innovation and earnings management,
suggesting that firms may leverage ecoinnovation not only for environmental
signalling but also to project financial stability and meet stakeholder
expectations. The analysis further uncovers that the propensity for earnings
management is amplified in firms facing financial constraints, proxied by low
Whited-Wu (WW) scores and weak sales performance, and in those characterised by
high financial opacity. We employ a robust multi-method approach to address
potential endogeneity and selection bias, including entropy balancing,
propensity score matching (PSM), and the Heckman Test correction. Our research
contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the dual
strategic role of ecoinnovation -balancing sustainability signalling with
earnings management, under varying financial conditions. The findings offer
actionable insights for regulators, investors, and policymakers navigating the
intersection of corporate transparency, financial health, and environmental
responsibility.

Abstract: There is a projected increase in offshore wind energy generation in the
United States over the next three decades, driven by legislative commitments
and government funding. Like other renewable technologies, the construction of
offshore wind farms has environmental impacts and spillover effects that must
be assessed. Developing offshore wind as a reliable domestic energy source
requires a multiregional analysis of economic and environmental effects of
constructing projects along lakefronts and coastal regions. Although no
commercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven
states have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035. This
study evaluates the spatial economic and environmental impacts of planned
projects by linking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Offshore
Renewables Balance-of-system Installation Tool (ORBIT) with a multiregional
input-output model of the U.S. economy developed in the Virtual Industrial
Ecology Lab. ORBIT provides capital investment requirements for installation,
which are combined with the model to estimate economic spillover effects.
Environmental impacts are assessed using a newly developed multiregional
greenhouse gas emissions dataset for the U.S. to capture supply chain emissions
of offshore wind construction. The five projects analyzed require 16.3 billion
dollars in capital investment and generate 27.6 billion dollars in direct and
indirect economic impacts across the country. Emissions results show that
states active in energy generation are most affected, but impacts can be
reduced by decarbonizing the grid. A carbon payback analysis indicates the
projects offset construction-phase emissions in less than a year. The framework
highlights which states experience the greatest spillover effects in terms of
emissions and economic activity required to support offshore wind expansion.

The model aims to\naddress the limitations of traditional recycling systems, which often rely on\nstatic government subsidies and fail to generate sustained public\nparticipation. By introducing dynamic token values linked to real-world supply\nand demand conditions, as well as incorporating non-monetary behavioral drivers\n(e.g., social norms, reputational incentives), the framework creates a\ndual-incentive structure that can adapt over time. The model uses Monte Carlo\nsimulations to estimate outcomes under a range of scenarios involving\noperational costs, carbon pricing, token volatility, and behavioral adoption\nrates. Due to the absence of real-world implementations of such integrated\nblockchain-based recycling systems, the paper remains theoretical and\nsimulation-based. It is intended as a prototype framework for future policy\nexperimentation and pilot projects. The model provides insights for\npolicymakers, urban planners, and technology developers aiming to explore\ndecentralized and market-responsive solutions to sustainable waste management.\nFuture work should focus on validating the model through field trials or\nbehavioral experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u56de\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e02\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u548c\u78b3\u4fe1\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56de\u6536\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u653f\u5e9c\u8865\u8d34\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u6fc0\u53d1\u516c\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4ee3\u5e01\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u884c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u58f0\u8a89\u6fc0\u52b1\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u6fc0\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u548c\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5e9f\u7269\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u653f\u7b56\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8bd5\u70b9\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u5730\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6216\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets.

Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there\nis a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure\nthat imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have\nbeen used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological\nnetworks.\n  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with\nmillions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge\ncan occur with multiple timestamps.

Our\napproach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted\nsampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method\ncarefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be\njointly and efficiently sampled.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

However,\nintegrating such tools into large, existing codebases remains a significant\nchallenge. While annotation inference can eliminate many errors automatically,\na subset of residual errors -- typically a mix of real bugs and false positives\n-- often persist and can only be resolved via code changes. Manually addressing\nthese errors is tedious and error-prone. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising path toward automating these repairs, but naively-prompted LLMs often\ngenerate incorrect, contextually-inappropriate edits. Resolving a nullability\nerror demands a deep understanding of how a symbol is used across the codebase,\noften spanning methods, classes, and packages. We present NullRepair, a system\nthat integrates LLMs into a structured workflow for resolving the errors from a\nnullability checker. NullRepair's decision process follows a flowchart derived\nfrom manual analysis of 200 real-world errors. It leverages static analysis to\nidentify safe and unsafe usage regions of symbols, using error-free usage\nexamples to contextualize model prompts. Patches are generated through an\niterative interaction with the LLM that incorporates project-wide context and\ndecision logic. Our evaluation on 12 real-world Java projects shows that\nNullRepair resolves an average of 72% of the errors that remain after applying\na state-of-the-art annotation inference technique. Unlike a naively-prompted\nLLM, NullRepair also largely preserves program semantics, with all unit tests\npassing in 10/12 projects after applying every edit proposed by NullRepair, and\n98% or more tests passing in the remaining two projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "NullRepair\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fee\u590dJava\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684nullability\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3Java\u9879\u76ee\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u9632\u6b62\u7a7a\u6307\u9488\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5927\u578b\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u6b8b\u4f59\u9519\u8bef\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u6613\u9519\u3002", "method": "NullRepair\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u53f7\u5b89\u5168\u4f7f\u7528\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9879\u76ee\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eJava\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0cNullRepair\u5e73\u5747\u4fee\u590d72%\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c10/12\u9879\u76ee\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u90e8\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NullRepair\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86nullability\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Indeed, numerous studies have examined the\nmacroeconomic impact of power network interruptions, employing a wide variety\nof modeling methods and data parameterization techniques, which warrants\nfurther investigation. In this paper, we quantify the macroeconomic effects of\nthree significant natural hazard-induced US power outages: Hurricane Ian\n(2022), the 2021 Texas Blackouts, and Tropical Storm Isaias (2020). Our\nanalysis evaluates the sensitivity of three commonly used data parameterization\ntechniques (household interruptions, kWh lost, and satellite luminosity), along\nwith three static models (Leontief and Ghosh, critical input, and inoperability\nInput-Output). We find the mean domestic loss estimates to be US $\\$3.13$ Bn,\nUS $\\$4.18$ Bn, and US $\\$2.93$ Bn, respectively. Additionally, data\nparameterization techniques can alter estimated losses by up to $23.1\\%$ and\n$50.5\\%$. Consistent with the wide range of outputs, we find that the GDP\nlosses are highly sensitive to model architecture, data parameterization, and\nanalyst assumptions.

In this work, we formulate\na surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation\n(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical\ninstruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach\nand introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object\nqueries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In\norder to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and\npart-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS\nto learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes.

It is\nparticularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular\nartifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median\nfiltering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels\nbut scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time\nmethods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such\nas histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.\n  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the\nsorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.\nWe propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate\nentirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access\nmemory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \\log(k))$ and $O(k)$,\nrespectively, for a $k \\times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based\nmethods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state\nof the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for\n8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \\times 3$ to $75 \\times 75$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u5757\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6392\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u9009\u62e9\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5b58\u53d6\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u7248\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728CUDA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5feb5\u500d\uff0c\u662f8\u300116\u548c32\u4f4d\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5feb\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other\nexisting benchmarks across video question answering and referring object\nsegmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed\nmodel consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and\nsegmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video\nand image understanding.

Using a dataset of\napproximately ten million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2024, we identify\nAI roles-positions requiring at least one AI-related skill-and examine the\nextent to which these roles offer non-monetary benefits such as tuition\nassistance, paid leave, health and well-being perks, parental leave, workplace\nculture enhancements, and remote work options. While previous research has\ndocumented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand\nand limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates\ninto enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are\nsignificantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for\neducation requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely\nfor an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to\nprovide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to\nbundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases\ncoincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave\nor health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than\nAI roles without this benefit. This pattern is particularly pronounced in years\nand occupations experiencing the highest AI-related demand, pointing to a\ndemand-driven dynamic.

Healthcare is one of such domains\nwhere KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge\naccuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing\ngeneral factual information often lack the ability to account for important\ncontexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are\ncrucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,\nHypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,\npotentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "HypKG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHRs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KGs\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e92\u8054\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edfKGs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800cEHRs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u5c06KGs\u4e0eEHRs\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8d85\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHypKG\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HypKG\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86KGs\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We present SynPAIN, a\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355\nneutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:\n20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we\ncreated demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically\nmeaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain\nexpressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than\nneutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment\ntools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate\nSynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection\nmodels. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial\nperformance disparities across demographic characteristics.

Our results indicate hybrid\nfiber/FSO deployments offer substantial cost savings compared to fully fibered\nnetworks, suggesting a beneficial trade-off for strategic link deployment while\nimproving the service coverage probability.

The\nmodel is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,\nbenchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with\nweighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network\ncomplexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable\nsimulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across\nsupply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing\nobjectives, approximating Pareto front sets.

Modern high performance\ncomputing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across\nnodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling\nand load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks\nsuch as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support\ndiverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling\nalgorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable\nalgorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.\n  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling\nalgorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across\nsix applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are\ncapable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require\nsignificant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.\nExpert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less\nexploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a\nspecific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based\nlearning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.\n  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling\nalgorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP\napplications.

Existing automated logging techniques focus on isolated\nsub-tasks - predicting a single log position, level, or message - and therefore\ncannot produce complete, high-quality log statements that reflect real-world\npractice in which multiple logs often appear inside one method. They also\nneglect deeper semantic dependencies among methods and consider only a narrow\nset of candidate variables, leading to superficial or incomplete logs. In this\npaper, we present PDLogger, the first end-to-end log generation technique\nexpressly designed for practical, multi-log scenarios. PDLogger operates in\nthree phases. (1) Log position prediction: block-type-aware structured prompts\nguide a large language model (LLM) to suggest candidate positions across all\ncontrol-flow blocks of a method. (2) Log generation: backward program slicing\nsupplies precise inter-procedural control and data-dependency context, while an\nexpanded variable extractor captures both member and external function\nexpressions; the enriched prompt enables the LLM to emit a full log statement\n(position, level, message, variables). (3) Log refinement: level correction and\ncontext-sensitive deduplication prune false positives and redundant logs. We\nevaluate PDLogger on 3,113 log statements drawn from two widely used Java\nprojects. Compared with the strongest prior systems, PDLogger improves\nlog-position precision by 139.0 percent, F1 by 69.2 percent, level accuracy by\n82.3 percent, variable precision by 131.8 percent, and message quality\n(BERTScore) by 65.7 percent.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists.

While recent advances leverage\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nmodels with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear\nacross diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically\ninvestigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code\npreferences.

While existing methods focus on\ndetecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from\nthe retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face\nRetouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring\noriginal faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional\nimage restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with\nvarious types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the\nlow-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nMoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR.

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism.

While\nthere exists limited integration between SBOMs and SCA tools, a unified view of\ncomplex dependency-vulnerability relationships remains elusive. In this paper,\nwe introduce VDGraph, a novel knowledge graph-based methodology for integrating\nvulnerability and dependency data into a holistic view. VDGraph consolidates\nSBOM and SCA outputs into a graph representation of software projects'\ndependencies and vulnerabilities. We provide a formal description and analysis\nof the theoretical properties of VDGraph and present solutions to manage\npossible conflicts between the SBOM and SCA data. We further introduce and\nevaluate a practical, proof-of-concept implementation of VDGraph using two\npopular SBOM and SCA tools, namely CycloneDX Maven plugin and Google's\nOSV-Scanner. We apply VDGraph on 21 popular Java projects. Through the\nformulation of appropriate queries on the graphs, we uncover the existence of\nconcentrated risk points (i.e., vulnerable components of high severity\nreachable through numerous dependency paths).

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class\nwithout human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of\nimages and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled\nby text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these\nworks do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and\nthus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or\nthe training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In\nthis work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,\nfrom which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.\nIn particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object\nlocalization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region\nexpansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the\nsemantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively\nspread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale\nself-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image\noften has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,\ncompared to complex-structured objects.

While\nnumerous automated techniques have been proposed for generating tests (either\nby maximizing code coverage or by translating focal code into test code),\npractical tests are seldom driven by coverage alone. In real projects, each\ntest reflects a developer's validation intention for a specific behaviour and\nembodies rich, project-specific knowledge: which specific APIs to call and what\nassertions truly matter. Without considering such knowledge, tests can hardly\npass code review and be integrated into the software product.\n  In this work, we propose IntentionTest, which generates project-specific\ntests with validation intention as a structured description. Our design is\nmotivated by two insights: (1) a description of validation intention, compared\nto coverage and focal code, carries more crucial information about what to\ntest; and (2) practical tests exhibit high code duplication, indicating that\ndomain knowledge is highly reusable for writing new tests. Given a focal code\nand a description of validation intention (in the form of either an informal\ncomment or a formal test plan), IntentionTest retrieves a referable test in the\nproject to guide test generation. Moreover, IntentionTest reduces the test\ngeneration problem into an editing problem on the test code regarding the\nvalidation intention.

Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery\ntrajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and\nresilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral\ncontrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and\nhighly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional\nflood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides\nthe temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial\nmulti-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and\nbare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between\nspectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address\nthese limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only\ntransformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,\nbypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely.

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a\ndouble-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of\nvarying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and\nanalyze their utility across diverse DNNs.

However, existing approaches often\nstruggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,\ntemporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this\nstudy, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention\nNetwork, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware\nattention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike\nconventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal\ntraffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based\nframework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System\n(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and\nrecall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within\nthe South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic\naccident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,\nand ROC-AUC of 0.89.

Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)\nfuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of\ninterest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians\ninto multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing\non sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while\noffering comprehensive scene perception.

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples.

Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are\nusually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have\nbeen widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their\nsuperior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the\nreal-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear\nself-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this\nissue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for\nits adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\nparticularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity.

This paper proposes an HSI\ndenoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),\nbased on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving\nthree-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel\ndomains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)\nintroducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract\ncross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a\ndynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain\ntexture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating\nmechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers\ncapture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep\nlayers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.\nExperiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST\nsignificantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational\nefficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%).

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\\leq$\n18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process\nbased entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%).

However, it remains\nunderexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships\nand perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation\npipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize\nspatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,\nwhich involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an\nobject within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement\nand rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the\ngeneration of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset\ncontamination.

In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task\nembeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL\nprompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by\nsoftly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using\npre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.\nThis method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt\ndemonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while\nreducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive\nevaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model\nfamilies of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method\noutperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show\nthat our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant\nroles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected\nby our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --\nunderscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality.

To tackle these challenges, we propose\nMambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features\nin the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,\nMambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from\nhistorical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to\nimprove robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a\ngating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of\nmap elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design\ninnovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to\nenhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies\nsignificantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring\nrobust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and\nArgoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges.

However, recent\nstudies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious\ncorrelations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a\nsimple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We\nquantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the\ncovariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results\nsystemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features\nfed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while\navoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular\nadvantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization\nterms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in\npractice.

However, one\ncritical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine\nstructures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive\nresolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.\nOne solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;\nhowever, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while\nmitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address\nthese issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the\n8$\\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\\times$ one while adapting to the\npre-trained UNet.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable\nalternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal\nhuman intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric\ninformation, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as\nsparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations.

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide.

It generates images by\nprogressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the\ncomputational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge\ndue to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce\nSparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction\nthat dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without\nrequiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation\nthat tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality\nin high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring\ntokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale\nprediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on\nhigh-frequency areas.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation.

To address this\nissue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave\ninfrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion\ndetection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature\ninteraction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,\nachieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive\nfused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images\nand improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the\nMulti-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive\nfused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple\nmodalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.\nMoreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object\nEnhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object\nsemantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary\nfused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,\nthereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a\nNearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective\nSWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this\nfield.

First, we propose a novel speckle-based\nvibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D\ngrid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset\nof vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we\ndevelop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and\nclassifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of\nmeasurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding\ncorrect liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.\nMoreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known\nclasses (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)\nand fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from\nvarious everyday containers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bb9\u5668\u8868\u9762\u5fae\u5c0f\u632f\u52a8\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5bb9\u5668\u5185\u6db2\u4f53\u9690\u85cf\u6db2\u4f4d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u80fd\u4ece\u7269\u4f53\u53ef\u89c1\u8868\u9762\u63d0\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5bb9\u5668\u5185\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u4e50\u7f50\u662f\u5426\u88c5\u6ee1\uff09\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u6591\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u63492D\u7f51\u683c\u70b9\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u632f\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5bb9\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6db2\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u632f\u52a8\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6db2\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u6db2\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u3001\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u4e2a\u5bc6\u5c01\u5bb9\u5668\u6db2\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,\npreserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward\ninversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser.

Despite its importance, there is currently no\npublicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration\nin UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and\nevaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To\nbridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ntailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This\ndataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely\nregistered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight\naltitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\\deg} to 75{\\deg}, and\nall-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination\nconditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated\nannotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each\ntriplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition\nattributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world\ndeployment settings.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely\nvisual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable\nreasoning models without requiring explicit supervision.

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a\ndistilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more\nefficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with\nUnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase\nin the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and\nself-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the\nSemantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly\ninjecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic\ninformation to different stages of the network.

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,\nwhich uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough\ndescription of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style\nattributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional\nQBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the\ndocument images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.\nExperiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our\nhypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document\nimage retrieval.

Deep learning\nmethods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.\nHowever, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one\ngeographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas.

We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging\nthe versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular\nimage-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our\nmethodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality\nand instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve\nsemantic clarity.

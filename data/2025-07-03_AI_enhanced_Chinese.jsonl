For the Glob converter, we introduce segment-boundary separation,\nimplement Cox's flattened search strategy, and develop optimized braced\ncondition handling to prevent exponential backtracking. Comprehensive\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our JSON parser achieves processing speeds up to\n125 MB/s on complex documents, consistently outperforming dkjson and showing\ncompetitive results against rxi_json across most test cases. Our Glob-to-LPeg\nconverter exhibits 14-92% better performance than Bun.Glob and runs 3-14 times\nfaster than Minimatch across diverse pattern matching scenarios.

Communities of Practice (CoPs) are increasingly adopted to support\nsocial learning beyond formal education, often relying on virtual\ncommunication. Psychological safety, a prerequisite for effective learning,\nremains insufficiently understood in these settings. This mixed-methods study\ninvestigates psychological safety within Agile CoPs through survey data from\n143 participants. Results indicate that psychological safety is significantly\nlower in online interactions compared to face-to-face settings. Moreover, low\npsychological safety reduces participants' intent to continue contributing and\navoidance of interpersonal risk. No significant differences emerged based on\ngender, community seniority, or content creation activity.

Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance\nworkload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to\ndynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are\ncompounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can\nhave vastly different performance profiles. To resolve these hindrances, we\npresent a novel FPGA-based accelerator for stochastic online scheduling (SOS).\nWe modify a greedy cost selection assignment policy by adapting existing cost\nequations to engage with discretized time before implementing them into a\nhardware accelerator design. Our design leverages hardware parallelism,\nprecalculation, and precision quantization to reduce job scheduling latency. By\nintroducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper\nestablishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous\ncomputing systems. The proposed design achieves high throughput, low latency,\nand energy-efficient operation, offering a scalable alternative to traditional\nsoftware scheduling methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent\nworkload distribution, fair machine utilization, and up to 1060x speedup over\nsingle-threaded software scheduling policy implementations.

In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates\nposition-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate\ninter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages\nABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency.\nSpecifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial\nbeamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In\nthis direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions,\nrevealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel\ncorrelation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an\nalternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for\nABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate\nof multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark\nto validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS\nrotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in\ninterference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can\nsignificantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and\nimprove the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\\% compared to\nfixed-direction ABSs without rotation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u51cf\u5c11\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u57fa\u7ad9\uff08ABSs\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6309\u9700\u8fde\u63a5\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5e94\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u4f53\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u8c03\u6574\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u8ddd\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u65b9\u4f4d\u89d2\u786e\u5b9a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u7ef4MIMO\u9635\u5217\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u53d7\u9650\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u603b\u901f\u7387\u6bd4\u56fa\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63d0\u5347\u7ea610%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

WIRL combines an LLM, a customized toolkit, and an\norchestration module to identify unresolved variables, retrieve context, and\nperform context-aware substitutions.

Drawing on Misesian a priori\nreasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems\nare incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination:\ninterpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value\nthrough prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as\noptimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under\nuncertainty.\n  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability,\nand Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which\nconflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights.\nAttempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of\nethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms,\ninterpret institutions, or bear responsibility.

However, existing designs support only a single sensor\nper tag, increasing spatial overhead. State-of-the-art approaches to\nmultiplexing multiple sensor streams on a single tag rely on onboard clocks or\nmultiple modulation chains, which add cost, enlarge form factor, and remain\nprone to timing drift-disrupting synchronization across sensors.\n  We present mmBack, a low-power, clock-free backscatter tag that enables\nsynchronous multi-sensor data acquisition and multiplexing over a single\nmodulation chain. mmBack synchronizes sensor inputs in parallel using a shared\nreference signal extracted from ambient RF excitation, eliminating the need for\nan onboard timing source.

This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We\nfocus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion\nmodels (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion\naround a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems\ninto two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision\nprocess (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions\nfrom the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization.\nWe also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking\ntasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical\ngeneralization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering\ninsights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most\nimportantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general\ncapabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We\nhighlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint\nsatisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic\nnature of outputs.

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively.

Leveraging\nAIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a\nnovel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better\nalign with human evaluators.

This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,\nStable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing\nmethods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,\nthe task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or\ninconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.\nOur analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the\ninitial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic\noutputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses\niterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to\nserve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a\nhigh-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,\nan Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure\nvalues, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is\ntime-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce\nthis overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to\nabout 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by\ntraining a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the\niterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising\npass using a LoRA swapping technique.

This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop\nrouting and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely\nwith real-world operations.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6027\uff09\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u8ba8\u73b0\u6709\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f8b\u5b50\u8bf4\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6539\u8fdbGelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u826f\u597d\u652f\u6301\u6027\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u539f\u5219\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b4\uff09\u7528\u65b0\u539f\u5219\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b5\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684GAS\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684GAS\u539f\u5219\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is\nessential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB\nsystems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than\naccurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved\nAWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera\nsensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has\nexplored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral\nwhite balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic\nconsistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms\nneutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a\ncamera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any\nneutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across\nunseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\\sim$500\nparameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile\nCPU.

LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which\ncan be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks.

We propose a physical attack framework\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and\nprecise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering\ncapabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and\nadversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among\nGaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the\nimaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out\nnon-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness and superiority of PGA.

In this study, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect\nstance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.\nSurprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,\nwith macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\\%.

Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based\nsystems which suggests that external information enhances performance,\nhighlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers.

To handle\nthis, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic\nThreshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and\nimproves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also\nleverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and\nDINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise\nbounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's\nzero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The\nquality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance\nto our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an\nobject matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the\naverage maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,\ncalculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance\nbetween each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image\ngrid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and\nmask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.\nWe empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,\noutperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the\nBOP 2023 challenge for the \"Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects\"\ntask.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOCTIS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u548cDINOv2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Grounded-SAM 2\u83b7\u53d6\u7269\u4f53\u63d0\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528DINOv2\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5757\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728BOP 2023\u6311\u6218\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNOCTIS\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RGB\u548cRGB-D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NOCTIS\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5339\u914d\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b0\u7269\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative\nvision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated\ncaptions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the\nproperties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot\nsmoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given\nthis challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single\ncaptioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach\nquantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and\nuniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.\nGiven the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two\nendpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very\nshort caption and one for a very long caption.

While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity\nverification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient\nrobustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of\nwatermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel\nrobust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By\nmodifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and\nwatermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise\nand generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial\ncondition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that\ngradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus\nbetter adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the\nfusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)\nmodule that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract\nwatermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.\nTo enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we\nintegrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake\nmanipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that\nemploys specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling\nprocess to generate more robust watermarked images.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in\ncompatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time\ncomplexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel\nlightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided\nSearch (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a\nhighly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique\nallows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained\ncompatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable\ntransformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$\nscores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with\nhigher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity\nand is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with\nexponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with\nsubstantial speed improvements.

Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly\nscores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment\nanomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant\nchallenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations\namong pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)\nvariabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing\nglobal thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or\nmiss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel\nmulti-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these\nlimitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO\ncombines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level\nsegmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we\npropose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that\nsequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual\nrepresentations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection\nmodel's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we\ndevelop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically\ngenerates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs\nand pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding\nstrategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained\nanomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other\npixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the\nperformance.

We find that models often\nfavor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what\nthe caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they\nfavor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in\nthe internal representational structure of the model, and that specific\nattention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over\nthe other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic \"router heads\" which appear to\npromote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can\nbe manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets\nand modalities.

Meanwhile,\nmany existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing\npotential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,\nonboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane\nenhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited\nonboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on\nefficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,\nCEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a\nMag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection\npotential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).\nOur results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both\nacceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally\nefficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the\nother more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than\noriginal Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and\nevaluate three band selection strategies.

To tackle this issue, a HOT\nframework, termed \\textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \\textbf{P}rompt\nguidance and human \\textbf{P}roximal \\textbf{P}erception.

While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown\npromising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches\nprimarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of\nperception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In\nthis paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal\nfusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We\npropose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion\nmodule, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are\nevaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly\nenhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes\ndataset.

We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike.

When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding.

Consequently,\nsegmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of\nlarge-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise\nlocalization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).\nHowever, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,\nwhich excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its\ninherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic\nsegmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models\nexcel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms\nthat the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability\nto learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models\nexhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided\nsolely by the original image.

Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic\nsegmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our\nframework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results\nfrom diverse discriminative architectures.

We address these\nchallenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable\nand API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized\nbenchmarking framework.\n  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art\nspecialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-4o\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u867d\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u94fe\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u548cAPI\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff1bGPT-4o\u5728\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

The ConvNet captures fine-grained local\nstructures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,\neffectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced\ndistortions.

While prior studies\nhave predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and\nachieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental\nbottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key\ncomponents: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a\nsystematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our\nfindings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual\ndeficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current\nmodels. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which\nenhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby\nenabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text\ncomprehension.

We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework\nthat enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for\nmulti-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a\nspecific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across\nall tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content\nalignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each\nmodule only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free\nfusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while\nmitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive\nexperiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject\nfidelity and prompt consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreeLoRA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u9898\u7684LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e3b\u9898\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e3b\u9898\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cFreeLoRA\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Full Token Tuning\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\u7684LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7Subject-Aware Inference\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFreeLoRA\u5728\u4e3b\u9898\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "FreeLoRA\u4e3a\u591a\u4e3b\u9898\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Answer-centric supervision is a\ncommonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this\nstrategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the\nanswer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows\nmodels to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the\nreasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts\nthrough common patterns in question-answer pairs.

However, in real-world scenarios where\nannotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with\nscarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)\nproblem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing\nLReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from\nlimited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy\nknowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we\npioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing\nPrototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key\ninnovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic\nprototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative\npurification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,\nlearnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the\nidentity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels.

Through this\ncyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve\ncurrent-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term\nlearning.

To address this, patient-specific digital twins\n(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of\nDIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation.

However,\ncurrent approaches conventionally separate image customization into\nposition-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal\nframework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image\ncustomization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference\nimages with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal\nattention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the\nIn-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented\nregister tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to\ncorrectly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in\npolyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a\nhigh-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world\nsources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and\nover-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial\napplications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and\ncreative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench\nand the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly\noutperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art\nopen-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human\npreference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment\nmetrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

Existing studies are limited to short-term\ncolorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features\nto achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local\nparadigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color\nconsistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can\nbe achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically\nextracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.\nSpecifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly\nincludes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color\nConsistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support\nthe DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to\ndynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with\nthe current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce\na Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency\nfusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both\nshort-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the\neffectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color\nconsistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and\nalignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct\nabnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,\nwe conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly\ncompetitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1).

Unlike existing\nmethods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by\ntime constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers\nhigh-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite\ntheir efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in\nmaintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step\ndenoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In\nthis paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating\ntwo key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical\ninterpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images\nby modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and\nensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We\nfurther introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention\nmodules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent\ntransitions that respect both inputs.

We provide an equivalent\ncharacterization of the DiD potential outcome model using sequential\nconditional moment restrictions on observables, which shows that the DiD\nidentification assumptions typically imply nonparametric overidentification\nrestrictions. We derive the semiparametric efficient influence function (EIF)\nin closed form for DiD and ES causal parameters under commonly imposed parallel\ntrends assumptions. The EIF is automatically Neyman orthogonal and yields the\nsmallest variance among all asymptotically normal, regular estimators of the\nDiD and ES parameters. Leveraging the EIF, we propose simple-to-compute\nefficient estimators. Our results highlight how to optimally explore different\npre-treatment periods and comparison groups to obtain the tightest (asymptotic)\nconfidence intervals, offering practical tools for improving inference in\nmodern DiD and ES applications even in small samples.

A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain\nsynchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or\ninconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCo-Forgetting Protocol\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u540c\u6b65\u4fee\u526a\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u65f6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u7ba1\u7406\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u534f\u8bae\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u7968\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u4e8ePBFT\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u534f\u8bae\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0852%\uff09\uff0c\u6295\u7968\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe88%\uff0c\u5171\u8bc6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe92%\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u4e3a82%\u3002", "conclusion": "Co-Forgetting Protocol\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

DCMF comprises\ntwo core components: the Context Evaluation Engine (CEE) and the Context\nManagement Module (CMM). The CEE calculates the Probability of Access (PoA)\nusing parameters such as Quality of Service (QoS), Quality of Context (QoC),\nCost of Context (CoC), timeliness, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),\nassigning weights to assess access likelihood. Based on this, the CMM applies a\nhybrid Dempster-Shafer approach to manage Context Freshness (CF), updating\nbelief levels and confidence scores to determine whether to cache, evict, or\nrefresh context items. We implemented DCMF in a Context-as-a-Service (CoaaS)\nplatform and evaluated it using real-world smart city data, particularly\ntraffic and roadwork scenarios.

The textual\ndataset spans 25 years, integrates new information as soon as it becomes\navailable, and covers a wide range of business sizes and industries. The tool\nuses both traditional text analysis techniques and powerful language models to\nprovide analysts and researchers with three key capabilities: (1) quickly\nquerying the entire history of business liaison meeting notes; (2) zooming in\non particular topics to examine their frequency (topic exposure) and analysing\nthe associated tone and uncertainty of the discussion; and (3) extracting\nprecise numerical values from the text, such as firms' reported figures for\nwages and prices growth. We demonstrate how these capabilities are useful for\nassessing economic conditions by generating text-based indicators of wages\ngrowth and incorporating them into a nowcasting model. We find that adding\nthese text-based features to current best-in-class predictive models, combined\nwith the use of machine learning methods designed to handle many predictors,\nsignificantly improves the performance of nowcasts for wages growth.

Specifically, we propose an affinity\nmatrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies\nfrom the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,\nenhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,\nwe introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the\nstudent to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns\nacross diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a\nsingle sample.

Yet, despite their widespread use, we still lack a principled\ntheory that can deduce these eigenvectors from first principles and place them\nin the context of a mechanistic model. Here, we calculate these eigenvectors\nanalytically for a model where the output of an economy in an activity\nincreases with the probability the economy is endowed with the factors required\nby the activity. We show that the eigenvector known as the Economic Complexity\nIndex or ECI is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is\nendowed with a factor, and that in a multi-factor model, it is an estimate of\nthe average endowment across all factors. We then generalize this result to\nother production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with\nprices, wages, and consumption.

High-resolution soil\nmaps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying\nvulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies.

As quantum computing\ntransitions from theory to implementation, developers face issues not present\nin classical software development, such as probabilistic execution, limited\nobservability, shallow abstractions, and low awareness of quantum-specific\ntools. To better understand current practices, we surveyed 26 quantum software\ndevelopers from academia and industry and conducted follow-up interviews\nfocused on testing, debugging, and recurring challenges. All participants\nreported engaging in testing, with unit testing (88%), regression testing\n(54%), and acceptance testing (54%) being the most common. However, only 31%\nreported using quantum-specific testing tools, relying instead on manual\nmethods. Debugging practices were similarly grounded in classical strategies,\nsuch as print statements, circuit visualizations, and simulators, which\nrespondents noted do not scale well.

Although recent research has increasingly focused on\nnon-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable\ndevices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the\nlimitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or\nmmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.\nThese limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,\nincluding system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading\nin WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based\nmethods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving\nMultimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.\nFirst, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse\nmillimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and\npreprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real\nbathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we\nintroduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch\nfor radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch\nfor vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,\nP2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art\napproaches.

In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different\nsources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors\nor sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and\nLiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a\nrange of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task\norchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs.

However, all but\na few of these approaches rely on the implicit assumption that anomalies\nmanifest as noisy, high-complexity outliers from some normal baseline. This\nwork challenges this assumption by investigating if a best-in-class detection\nmodel built on this assumption can effectively deal with real-world security\nevents' diverse signatures. We employ an LSTM-based autoencoder, a classical\nexample of a reconstruction-based anomaly detector, as our test vehicle. We\nthen contrast this model with a representative sampling of historical BGP\nanomalies, including the Slammer worm and the Moscow blackout, and with a\nsimulated 'BGP storm' designed as a positive control. Our experience unveils a\nblind spot of our model: the model easily identifies the synthetic anomaly of\nhigh complexity but invariably fails to identify real-world events that\nmanifest in the form of a \"signal loss\" (e.g., Slammer, Moscow Blackout) or\n\"low-deviation\" (e.g., WannaCry) signature.

Unlike\nexisting RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a\nnovel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a\nstructured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent\nsystem orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy\ncreation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for\narticle generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with\nresolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -\nreducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving\nquality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG\nsystems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.\n38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.\nBy automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in\nexperts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:\nreducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating\nself-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future\nsupply chain tickets.

While\nspecialized network infrastructure (e.g., time-sensitive networking (TSN)\nswitches) provides deterministic data transport across the network, achieving\nstrict end-to-end timing guarantees requires equally capable end devices to\nsupport deterministic traffic. These end devices, however, often employ\ngeneral-purpose computing platforms like standard PCs, which lack native\nsupport for deterministic traffic and suffer from unpredictable delays\nintroduced by their software stack and system architecture. Although\nspecialized NICs with hardware scheduling offload can mitigate this problem,\nthe limited compatibility hinders their widespread adoption, particularly for\ncost-sensitive applications or in legacy devices.\n  To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel software-based driver model,\nnamely KeepON, to enable the support of deterministic packet transmissions on\nend devices equipped with standard NICs. The key idea of KeepON is to have the\nNIC keep on transmitting fixed-size data chunks as placeholders, thereby\nmaintaining a predictable temporal transmission pattern. The real-time packets\ngenerated by the mission-critical application(s) will then be precisely\ninserted into this stream by replacing placeholders at the designated position\nto ensure their accurate transmission time. We implement and evaluate KeepON by\nmodifying the network driver on a Raspberry Pi using its standard NIC.

In this work,\nthe network dynamism is governed by an oblivious adversary that controls which\nnodes join and leave the system in each round. The adversary has full knowledge\nof the system and unbounded computational power, but cannot see the random\nchoices made by the protocol. Our analysis builds on the framework of Augustine\net al. [FOCS 2015], and shows that our distributed algorithm maintains a\nconstant-degree expander graph with high probability, despite a continuous\nadversarial churn with a rate of up to $\\mathcal{O}(n/polylog(n))$ per round,\nwhere $n$ is the stable network size.

Such\ninformation includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,\nmaterial specifications, and textual annotations.

Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches.

Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics.

A notable security\nconcern is the Routing Table Falsification (RTF) attack, where attackers forge\nDestination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages to promote fake routes via a\nparent nodes routing table. Experimental results indicate that RTF attacks\nsignificantly reduce packet delivery ratio, increase end-to-end delay, and\nleverage power consumption.

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks.

We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct\nextensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative\nopen-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt\ntemplates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical\nmetrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in\nperformance.

Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their\nbehaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91d1\u94b1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6743\u8861\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u4f4e\u62a5\u916c\u63a5\u53d7\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u7406\u7531\u62d2\u7edd\u9ad8\u989d\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLMs\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u4e0e\u91d1\u94b1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u9002\uff08\u5982\u989d\u5916\u6b65\u884c\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u3001\u9965\u997f\u548c\u75bc\u75db\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u4f4e\u62a5\u916c\u63a5\u53d7\u548c\u65e0\u7406\u7531\u62d2\u7edd\u9ad8\u989d\u5956\u52b1\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0d\u4fbf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly\napplicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo\ntime-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory\nfor conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and\nmany outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle\nwith semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to\naddress these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In\neach stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing\nmemory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame\nalignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each\nvideo and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then\nmodels relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles\nlong videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286\nlabeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared\nto baselines, with limited computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTPT\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86IVF\u80da\u80ce\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "STPT\u5206\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u572823,027\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\uff083,286\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cSTPT\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.635\u7684AUC\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "STPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u80da\u80ce\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Specifically, MAdroid\nemploys two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and\nsupervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role:\nthe Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user\ninteractions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task\nautomation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive\ntasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the\ntasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

We show that all\nconsistent channel selection functions are equivalent to the function that\nalways selects the smallest-index channel under appropriate channel relabeling.\nThis leads to a natural representation of a consistent channel hopping\nalgorithm as a sequence of permutations. For the two-user MRP, we characterize\nrendezvous time slots using a fictitious user and derive tight bounds on the\nmaximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) and expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR).\nNotably, the ETTR is shown to be the inverse of the Jaccard index when\npermutations are randomly selected.

Consequently,\ngenerating new datasets through code perturbation has become essential.\nHowever, existing methods often fail to produce complex and diverse variations,\nstruggle with complex cross-file dependencies, and lack support for multiple\nprogramming languages, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing LLM\nevaluations for coding tasks. To fill this gap, we propose CodeMorph, an\napproach designed to support multiple programming languages while preserving\ncross-file dependencies to mitigate data leakage. CodeMorph consists of two\nmain components that work together to enhance the perturbation process. The\nfirst component employs 26 semantic-preserving transformation methods to\niteratively perturb code, generating diverse variations while ensuring that the\nmodified code remains compilable.

Our\nperformance evaluation, leveraging COMSOL models of real-world wearables,\nconfirms that TAO reduces offloading cost by over 35% compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches, without violating the wearable operational limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAO\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316XR\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u529f\u8017\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "XR\u8bbe\u5907\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u77ac\u65f6\u529f\u8017\u3001\u77ed\u671f\u6e29\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7535\u6c60\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565TAO\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7COMSOL\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cTAO\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u5378\u8f7d\u6210\u672c\u8d85\u8fc735%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u8bbe\u5907\u64cd\u4f5c\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "TAO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u8bbe\u5907\u9650\u5236\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal\nbenchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level\nphysics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8\nmajor sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The\nbenchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,\nsystematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative\nmodel-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous\nmulti-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,\nautomated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading\nsystem with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current\nstate-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.\nFor example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\\% accuracy in the proposed\nPhysUniBench.

Research efforts have been dedicated\nto improving different aspects of FL, such as algorithm improvement, resource\nallocation, and client selection, to enable its deployment in distributed edge\nnetworks for practical applications. One of the reasons for the poor FL model\nperformance is due to the worker dropout during training as the FL server may\nbe located far away from the FL workers. To address this issue, an Hierarchical\nFederated Learning (HFL) framework has been introduced, incorporating an\nadditional layer of edge servers to relay communication between the FL server\nand workers. While the HFL framework improves the communication between the FL\nserver and workers, large number of communication rounds may still be required\nfor model convergence, particularly when FL workers have non-independent and\nidentically distributed (non-IID) data. Moreover, the FL workers are assumed to\nfully cooperate in the FL training process, which may not always be true in\npractical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nsynthetic-data-empowered HFL framework that mitigates the statistical issues\narising from non-IID local datasets while also incentivizing FL worker\nparticipation. In our proposed framework, the edge servers reward the FL\nworkers in their clusters for facilitating the FL training process. To improve\nthe performance of the FL model given the non-IID local datasets of the FL\nworkers, the edge servers generate and distribute synthetic datasets to FL\nworkers within their clusters. FL workers determine which edge server to\nassociate with, considering the computational resources required to train on\nboth their local datasets and the synthetic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5de5\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u6fc0\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5de5\u4eba\u9000\u51fa\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HFL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u53d1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u5de5\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u52b1\u5de5\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8d4b\u80fd\u7684HFL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86FL\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A simple yet\neffective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing).\nUnfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered\nmultiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a\ncoarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to\nwhether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language\nModels (LLMs) into fuzzing. However, current LLM-based fuzzing techniques only\nfocus on using LLMs to generate test cases while overlooking their potential to\nanalyze feedback information, failing to create more valid and diverse test\ncases. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to break the seal of Feedback-driven\nfuzzing for DL frameworks. The backbone of FUEL comprises two LLM-based agents,\nnamely analysis LLM and generation LLM. Analysis LLM agent infers analysis\nsummaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM agent creates\ntests guided by these analysis summaries. So far, FUEL has detected 104 bugs\nfor PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 47 already fixed,\nand 5 assigned with CVE IDs.

This leads to new results about\nimplementations of concurrent objects from various primitives including window\nregisters and interfering primitives. We consider implementations that provide\nboth strong linearizability and decisive linearizability.\n  We identify that lock-free, respectively, wait-free, strongly linearizable\nimplementations of several concurrent objects entail a form of agreement that\nis weaker than consensus but impossible to strongly-linearizable implement with\ncombinations of non-universal primitives. In both cases, lock-free and\nwait-free, this form of agreement requires a distinguished process to referee a\ncompetition that involves all other processes.

This\nmethod is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,\nand integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the\ncontext understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault\nchains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised\nclustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and\nsemantic schema.

Code: https://github.com/jusiro/SS-Text", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image\nanalysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding\nrich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of\nmodality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful\nresults, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.\nHowever, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the\ndistribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.\nFirst, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that\nbreaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world\nscenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional\nvalidation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly\ndata-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and\nintroduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting.

While recent work in AI safety\nand mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,\nthey often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for\nother technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render\ndifferent alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting\nalignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in\nterms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according\nto which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the\npotential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI\nsystems.

This\npaper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that\nenhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four\nspecialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query\nGeneration Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval\nAgent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for\nsynthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.\nEvaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system\nachieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods.

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video.

These scripts are ubiquitous in modern software development\npipelines for streamlining testing and delivery. While developing build\nscripts, practitioners may inadvertently introduce code smells. Code smells are\nrecurring patterns of poor coding practices that may lead to build failures or\nincrease risk and technical debt. The goal of this study is to aid\npractitioners in avoiding code smells in build scripts through an empirical\nstudy of build scripts and issues on GitHub. We employed a mixed-methods\napproach, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. We conducted a\nqualitative analysis of 2000 build-script-related GitHub issues. Next, we\ndeveloped a static analysis tool, Sniffer, to identify code smells in 5882\nbuild scripts of Maven, Gradle, CMake, and Make files, collected from 4877\nopen-source GitHub repositories. We identified 13 code smell categories, with a\ntotal of 10,895 smell occurrences, where 3184 were in Maven, 1214 in Gradle,\n337 in CMake, and 6160 in Makefiles.\n  Our analysis revealed that Insecure URLs were the most prevalent code smell\nin Maven build scripts, while Hardcoded Paths/URLs were commonly observed in\nboth Gradle and CMake scripts.

Secondly, these systems are\nassessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not\nadequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this\npaper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these\nlimitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling\nhuman-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach\ncombines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate\nhierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to\nidentify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths\nusing a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient\noperational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration\nlearning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over\ntime based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization\nand adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state\ntransitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked\nchallenges in current benchmarks.

This paper introduces Property-Generated\nSolver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to\nvalidate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on\nspecific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define\nand verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the\n\"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are\nmeant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative\nLLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative\nrefinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate\nsemantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting\ncomprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its\nrefinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within\nthis iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a\nrobust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.\nExtensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1\nimprovements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProperty-Generated Solver\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08PBT\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff08TDD\uff09\u5728LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff1aGenerator\u8d1f\u8d23\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0cTester\u7ba1\u7406PBT\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProperty-Generated Solver\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfTDD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534723.1%\u81f337.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7PBT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6b63\u786e\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

CodeBERT, a pre-trained language model for\nboth natural and programming languages, was fine-tuned to classify user dropout\ngiven their posts (questions and answers) and code snippets. We found Bagging\nensemble models combined with standardisation achieved the highest R2 value\n(0.821) in predicting user answers. The Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor,\nfollowed by Bagging and Epsilon Support Vector Machine models, consistently\ndemonstrated superior performance to other benchmarked algorithms in predicting\nuser code quality across multiple quality dimensions and languages. Extreme\nGradient Boosting paired with log-transformation exhibited the highest F1-score\n(0.825) in predicting user dropout. CodeBERT was able to classify user dropout\nwith a final F1-score of 0.809, validating the performance of Extreme Gradient\nBoosting that was solely based on numerical data.

The Cooperative\nEvasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to\nmaximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively\nevading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,\nespecially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,\nwhich intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and\nformation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in\nlocating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework\n(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),\nwhich delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a\nlow-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.\nSpecifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication\n(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish\nconsensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.\nMeanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal\npolicy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level\ncontrol.

A typical scenario involves scammers deploying\nhoneypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and\ndraining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current\nmethods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize\nstatistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug\nPull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and\nsuspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one\naspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively.\n  In this paper, we propose RPhunter, a novel technique that integrates code\nand transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPhunter establishes declarative\nrules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further\nconstructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage\ntransaction information, RPhunter formulates dynamic token transaction\nactivities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are\ncharacterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives.\nFinally, RPhunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary\nfeatures from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model\nto enhance the detection of Rug Pull.

A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses\noptimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly\nbetter black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions\nlike low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),\nwhereas optimization-based methods fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPatchHunter\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08SDE\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPatchHunter\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8865\u4e01\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u7834\u574fSDE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "PatchHunter\u5728KITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001CARLA\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PatchHunter\u4e3a\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, like previous language models, reasoning\nmodels are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are\nincorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is\ncritical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.\nTo this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this\nwork. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning\nmodels well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model\ncalibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated).

Subgroup analyses by medication\nformulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that\nnon-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings\nhighlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises\nand show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can\nyield policy-relevant insights.

We critically re-evaluated the\nDETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature\nof its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information\nredundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated\nScale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header\ninspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual\nperception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN\nbackbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and\ncross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables\neach region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature\ndimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

Recent\nmethods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to\nsynthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.\nHowever, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in\ndistorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static\n3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.\nTo alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that\nleverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a\nnew perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object\ndynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to\n3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera\ntrajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to\ncomplete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,\nproducing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera\ntrajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early\nstopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and\nimprove visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal\nlarge language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in\ncurrent view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with\nobject movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual\ndynamic scene view generation.

Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we\nobserve that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same\ntime, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining\nsignificantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These\nfindings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,\nemphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term\ncontrol and alignment of deployed AI systems.

Specifically, considering that our ROI often\nmanifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce\na Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's\nability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four\ndistinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing\ncontext, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module\nexplicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the\ndataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns\nassociated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an\nAdaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different\npatterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating\nthe final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale\npelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of\nour PDC-Net over existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPDC-Net\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceMRI\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u76c6\u8154\u653e\u5c04\u635f\u4f24\uff08PRI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u76c6\u8154\u653e\u5c04\u635f\u4f24\uff08PRI\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u9884\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u5272\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u5668\u5b98\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6df7\u6dc6\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPDC-Net\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08MDA\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5f62\u72b6\u62df\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u5757\uff08MGC\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff08AFD\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76c6\u8154\u653e\u5c04\u635f\u4f24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cPDC-Net\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PDC-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PRI\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Achieving comprehensive\nAI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day\nresearch data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,\ninefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly\nmultidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge\nwith sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains.

The code is\n  available at\n  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuVuIgkArCryVSifJDyG7R468DCLMkF2/view?usp=sharing", "summary": "This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a\nnovel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest\na mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to\ninternalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for\nfuture work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,\nand progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by\ntraining on formal constitutional principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faProgramming by Backprop (PBB)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\uff08\u65e0\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u65e0I/O\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u7ec4\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u542bI/O\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u4e0d\u542bI/O\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03LLMs\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790PBB\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u9690\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0cPBB\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eI/O\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee3\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7fLLMs\u5185\u5316\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7b26\u53f7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Keypoints simplify body\nstructure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of\nfull-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but\ncomplicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements.

Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework.

This mixed-methods systematic review\nexamines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and\npractitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary\nprompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,\nself-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and\nparameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential\nfor reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias\ntypes. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines\ndemonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction\nin bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting\noffers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results\nunderscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias\nwithout requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies\nidentified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area.

While\nLiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement\nand remains robust under adverse conditions.

To\naddress this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we\npropose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and\ncross-modal uncertainty.

Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the\nproper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better\nperformance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.\nMoreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/whyNLP/PCCoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e76\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08PCCoT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Jacobi\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8282\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4f46\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Jacobi\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u987a\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPCCoT\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u8fd150%\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "PCCoT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fde\u7eedCoT\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents\ncritical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often\ndispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle\nto model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional\nspatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering\n(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and\nstrengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by\nclustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with\ncluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional\nintra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which\ndynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via\nfeature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating\nsemantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate\nsemantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo\nintegrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while\nenhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive\nexperiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The unit cost of an LLM is\nthe computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in\nthe efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the\nnumber of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation\nis that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the\ntokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most\nlikely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for\ndifferent tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot\nconversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in\nthis domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e3a\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u80fd\u51cf\u5c115%\u523010%\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6f5c\u5728\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bed\u6599\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u804a\u5929\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c115%\u523010%\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u539f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u6548\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5c0f\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Weakly supervised learning\nprovides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse\nannotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance\ndegradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.\nTo address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised\ncross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main\ncomponents: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature\nlearning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the\nmodality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning\nnetwork effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal\nimages, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation\nperformance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides\nsegmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and\ninter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while\npromoting feature alignment.

To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental\nTraining Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we\nconstructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,\nwhich leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original\ndata into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental\nTraining Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by\nperforming Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT\ndata. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards\non the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training\non the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The\nresulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4\naddresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture\ncomplex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture\nspace of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation\nexperiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the\nreasoning ability of 1B SVLM.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of\nexplainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these\nconcepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image\nclassification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new\nchallenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in\nimaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as\nalterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training\nrequires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with\nimage-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and\nfaithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring\nexpert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification\nstrategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only\nimage-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without\nsacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking\nmisactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative\nconcepts.

While\ngenerative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly\nfocus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of\nfalse positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial\ndiffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive\nvariability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false\npositive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,\nwe design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis\nspace using polyp detection datasets.

We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook.

This poses\na challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying\nleaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning\nframework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease\nclassification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by\ncombining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting\nthe feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are\nstate-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain\nadapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping\nclasses with the specific downstream task of interest.

However, we\nidentify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn\nshortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly\nstrong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and\n(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with\nthe motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex\nreasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this\npaper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1\ndesigned to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD.

To address\nthis problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution\ninformation in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo\nlabels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first\nstage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the\nsecond stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected\nframes with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better\npredict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal\ninformation at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization\nperformance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level\npseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)\nmodule, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high\nquality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of\nsequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to\none specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive\nTemporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks\ncalled Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate\nCASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used\nas two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo\nlabels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal\ndomain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve\neach stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels\nfrom another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5e27\u7ea7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08ILG\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6807\u7b7e\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08PTLR\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Although\nthree-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and\ncanopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder\naccurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud\ncompletion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to\nsilique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation\nframework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation\nmethod and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset\nby distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point\ncloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic\ngraph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict\noccluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph\nconvolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural\nvariations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud\ncompletion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators\nfrom complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated\nthat RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,\nand 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,\nrespectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE\nmodules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique\nefficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%\ncompared to incomplete point clouds.

With the emergence of\nstate-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved\nremarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images\ninto 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting\ninteractions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining\ntheir ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these\nfundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture\ncomprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic\nMamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by\nprioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,\neffectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks\nthrough brightness-guided selective attention.

We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique\nwhere a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained\nteacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers\nsignificantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher\nmodel tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision\nfor tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by\nreformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and\nintra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction\ndistributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),\nrespectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias.

The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across\nmultiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse\nconditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)\nmethod, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate\nconsistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the\nnext-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its\neffectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating\nwidely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract\neffective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that\naccommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training\nstrategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection\nmodules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal\nconditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This\nstrategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to\nenhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through\nthe randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the\noverfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the\n\"Shuffle View\" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the\ntraining data by several magnitudes.

The concept of\nrevocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme\nis revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme\nrevoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the\nindividual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition\npower. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust\nrevocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and\ntraining set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face\nmatcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)\nstrongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power\nextends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have\nthe same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the\nmodels can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value\nin attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor\ntemplate.

Existing encoder decoder based methods\ntypically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption\nthat the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of\nlogical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics\nof normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable\nsemantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of\nnormal samples by vector quantisation.

Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they\noften lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the\ncooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual\nvisual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a\nspecified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's\nexecution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the\ninitial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge\nextracted from large language models by generating detailed textual\ndescriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained\nvisual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,\nVisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding.

In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time\ntraining can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the\ninpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed\nby rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid\napproach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA\n4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show\nthat our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual\nsmoothness.", "AI": {"tldr": "MVAA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u594f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u8282\u594f\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "MVAA\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u8282\u62cd\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e27\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMVAA\u80fd\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u8282\u62cd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\uff0810\u5206\u949f\u5185\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MVAA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and\nthus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse\ncamera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and\nunengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips.

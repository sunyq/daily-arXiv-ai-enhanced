TL;DR: 链式机器人框架(CoA)通过多机器蒸聚和机器人强化学习技术，在单模型中实现了类似多机器系统的复杂问题解决能力，并在多个测试集上创造了新的最高绩效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多机器系统依赖于手动提示工程和复杂的机器人框架，导致计算效率低、能力有限且无法从数据中学习。需要一种新的方法来在单个模型中实现类似多机器系统的复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 提出链式机器人(CoA)范式，通过多机器蒸聚框架将最优多机器系统转换为链式机器人轨迹进行有监督微调，然后使用机器人强化学习在可验证任务上进一步提升模型能力。

Result: 形成的机器人基础模型(AFMs)在网络机器人和代码机器人多个测试集上都达到了新的最高绩效。

Conclusion: CoA框架为单模型实现复杂多机器协作问题解决提供了有效途径，通过蒸聚和强化学习技术显著提升了模型能力，为机器模型研究建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [2] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cognitive Workspace是一种新的LLM上下文管理范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆的认知机制，超越了传统的RAG方法，实现了主动记忆管理和任务驱动的上下文优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM虽然上下文窗口扩展到百万token，但被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态性和任务驱动特性，缺乏元认知意识和主动规划能力。

Method: 基于Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论和Hutchins分布式认知框架，提出三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲区和任务驱动上下文优化。

Result: 实验验证显示Cognitive Workspace平均记忆重用率达到58.6%（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著性p < 0.001，Cohen's d > 23。

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优越性的定量证据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

### [3] [AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174)
*Hongjun Ding,Binqi Chen,Jinsheng Huang,Taian Guo,Zhengyang Mao,Guoyi Shao,Lutong Zou,Luchen Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AlphaEval框架，通过五个维度（预测能力、稳定性、程度性、金融逻辑、多样性）评估alpha信号，解决传统回测评估方法的计算成本高、效率低、维度单一等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融alpha挖掘预测信号的评估存在回测计算成本高、效率低、对策略参数敏感等问题，相关性指标只能评估预测能力而忽视其他重要属性。现有模型多为闭源，影响可复现性和领域进步。

Method: 设计AlphaEval统一框架，并行化且无需回测。从五个维度综合评估alpha质量：预测能力、时间稳定性、市场干扰程度性、金融逻辑合理性、多样性。

Result: 在代表性alpha挖掘算法上进行广泛实验，AlphaEval评估一致性与全面回测相当，但提供更全面的洞察和更高效率。同时能有效识别优秀alpha，超越传统单指标筛选方法。

Conclusion: AlphaEval为自动化alpha挖掘提供了统一、高效、全面的评估方案，充分考虑了alpha信号的多维度质量。开源实现促进了可复现性和社区参与。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

### [4] [Fitting Ontologies and Constraints to Relational Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13176)
*Simon Hosemann,Jean Christoph Jung,Carsten Lutz,Sebastian Rudolph*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究如何从正负示例中拟合本体和约束，分析多种描述逻辑和TGD类的计算复杂性、算法设计和本体大小，并探讨有限基的存在性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从有限关系结构的正负示例中自动学习本体和约束的问题，这对于知识表示和数据库系统的自动化构建具有重要意义

Method: 使用描述逻辑EL和ELI以及多种TGD类（完全、守卫、边界守卫、边界一、无限制TGD和包含依赖）作为本体和约束语言，进行复杂性分析、算法设计和本体大小分析

Result: 精确确定了计算复杂性，设计了相应算法，分析了拟合本体和TGD的大小，并发现有限基在EL、ELI、守卫TGD和包含依赖中存在，但在完全、边界守卫和边界一TGD中一般不存在

Conclusion: 该研究为从示例中学习本体和约束提供了理论基础和实用算法，揭示了不同语言在有限基存在性方面的差异，对知识表示和数据库理论有重要贡献

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

### [5] [A Hardware-oriented Approach for Efficient Active Inference Computation and Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13177)
*Nikola Pižurica,Nikola Milović,Igor Jovančević,Conor Heins,Miguel de Prado*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种将Active Inference框架与硬件优化计算图相结合的方法，显著降低了计算延迟和内存使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Inference框架虽然提供了强大的决策能力，但其计算和内存需求在资源受限环境中部署存在挑战

Method: 整合pymdp的灵活性和效率，构建统一的稀疏计算图，针对硬件高效执行进行优化

Result: 延迟降低超过2倍，内存使用减少高达35%

Conclusion: 该方法推进了高效Active Inference智能体在实时和嵌入式应用中的部署

Abstract: Active Inference (AIF) offers a robust framework for decision-making, yet its
computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment, especially in
resource-constrained environments. This work presents a methodology that
facilitates AIF's deployment by integrating pymdp's flexibility and efficiency
with a unified, sparse, computational graph tailored for hardware-efficient
execution. Our approach reduces latency by over 2x and memory by up to 35%,
advancing the deployment of efficient AIF agents for real-time and embedded
applications.

### [6] [The Interpretability Analysis of the Model Can Bring Improvements to the Text-to-SQL Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13178)
*Cong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CESQL模型通过模型可解释性分析和执行引导策略，结合过滤调整、逻辑关联优化和模型融合，显著提升了WikiSQL数据集上WHERE子句条件值预测的准确性，减少了对条件列数据和人工标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升文本到SQL模型在真实应用中的基础能力和泛化能力，特别是在处理WHERE子句语义解析时减少对条件列数据和人工标注训练数据的依赖。

Method: 整合模型可解释性分析和执行引导策略，结合过滤调整、逻辑关联优化和模型融合，设计CESQL模型实现条件增强。

Result: 在WikiSQL数据集上表现优异，显著提升了预测结果的准确性，特别是在WHERE子句条件值预测方面取得了突破。

Conclusion: 这项工作为处理复杂查询和真实数据库环境中不规则数据场景的研究提供了新的视角，有望推动文本到SQL技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [7] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文发现了一种新的数据污染形式——搜索时污染（STC），即搜索型LLM代理在评估时通过在线搜索获取到包含测试问题及答案的数据集，导致评估结果失真。研究发现HuggingFace等平台上的公开评估数据集是主要污染源，当屏蔽这些源后，准确率下降约15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据污染研究主要关注训练数据泄露，但忽视了搜索型LLM代理在评估过程中可能通过在线搜索获取测试数据的问题，这种搜索时污染会严重损害基准测试的有效性和可信度。

Method: 通过在三个常用基准测试（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上运行搜索型LLM代理，分析其搜索日志，识别从HuggingFace等平台获取测试问题及答案的情况，并进行屏蔽实验和消融研究。

Result: 约3%的问题可以直接从HuggingFace找到带标签的数据集；屏蔽HuggingFace后，受污染子集的准确率下降约15%；公开可访问的评估数据集并非STC的唯一来源。

Conclusion: 提出了基准测试设计和结果报告的最佳实践建议，以解决这种新型泄露问题，确保搜索型LLM代理评估的可信度，并公开了完整的实验日志以供审计。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

### [8] [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过动态选择重要token来减少计算成本，同时保持自回归生成能力，在多模态领域实现了计算效率与准确性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型处理更大规模输入，token级别的计算成本成为主要瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的或不兼容自回归生成，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 基于注意力范数大小动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器指导选择过程，并引入轻量级transformer先验模型在合并后的token序列上进行训练，以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge显著减少token数量，同时匹配甚至超越学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能，在计算-准确性权衡方面取得一致改进。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了使用更少token的准确生成，为大规模生成模型提供了有效的计算优化方案。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

### [9] [AI sustains higher strategic tension than humans in chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13213)
*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 棋牌中人工智能与人类在战略决策中的差异：AI能持续维持更高的战略强度，而人类因认知限制而控制复杂性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与AI在战略决策中的差异，了解即时机会与长期目标的罕量管理方式

Method: 通过网络基于的棋子互动指标来定量化棋局中的战略强度和竞争性

Result: AI玩家能持续维持比人类更高的战略强度；人类专业水准在1600和2300伊洛分数处出现突变；两者采取不同的战略策略

Conclusion: AI与人类在复杂战略环境中的性能差异可能影响AI在相关领域的应用

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了多跳个性化推理任务，研究不同记忆机制在处理大量用户信息时的多步推理能力，并提出了HybridMem混合方法来充分利用显式和隐式记忆的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的记忆方法主要关注偏好对齐和简单问答，而真实世界中的复杂任务需要在大量用户信息上进行多步推理，这对当前的记忆方法构成了挑战。

Method: 明确定义了多跳个性化推理任务，构建了数据集和统一评估框架，实现了各种显式和隐式记忆方法，并探索了混合方法，提出了HybridMem方法来充分利用两种方法的优势。

Result: 通过完整的实验评估了各种方法在这一任务上的性能，分析了它们的优缺点，并验证了HybridMem方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文为多跳个性化推理任务提供了一个统一的研究框架，通过实验证明了混合记忆方法的优势，为后续研究奠定了基础并提供了开源资源。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献中大量材料数据被困在非结构化的图表中，阻碍了基于大语言模型的AI代理进行自动化材料设计

Method: 提出DIVE多智能体工作流，系统读取科学文献中的图形元素并组织实验数据，专注于固态氢存储材料

Result: 相比多模态模型直接提取，DIVE将数据提取准确性和覆盖率提高了10-15%（商业模型）和30%以上（开源模型），建立了包含4,000篇文献30,000条数据的数据库，可在2分钟内识别新的氢存储材料成分

Conclusion: DIVE AI工作流和代理设计可广泛应用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多模态心血管病辅助诊断框架CardAIc-Agents，解决了传统AI医疗系统在临床应用中的四大问题：缺乏领域工具支持、固化工作流程、静态知识库和限制的多模态处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管病是全球首要死因，医疗人员短缺严重。AI助手虽有潜力减轻负担，但现有系统在临床应用中遇到了四大障碍：缺乏领域工具支持、固化工作流程、静态知识库和限制的多模态处理能力。

Method: 设计了多模态框架CardAIc-Agents，包括：1）CardiacRAG代理从可更新心血知识生成一般计划；2）主代理集成工具自主执行计划并作出决策；3）步进式更新策略根据执行结果动态优化计划；4）多学科讨论工具处理挑战性案例；5）可视化审查面板支持临床验证。

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents框架通过多模态集成、工具支持、动态调整和多学科协作，有效解决了传统AI医疗系统在临床应用中的关键问题，为心血管病的自动化早期识别和主动筛查提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于现有最先进的LLM-based AHD方法，能够生成更高质量的启发式，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更好的查询效率。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻性和后见性提示的双重机制，成功将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

### [15] [LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371)
*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP是一种新的神经-符号规划框架，通过迭代对话方式让神经网络和符号规划器协同工作，解决了现有方法在复杂领域中的计划错误问题，在IPC标准测试中达到了85.8%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经规划方法在复杂领域中存在缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉等问题，而经典规划器缺乏灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有的神经-符号方法采用一次性翻译方式，没有充分利用神经和符号组件的协同优势。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经组件和符号组件之间的迭代对话过程，集成13个协调的神经特征，包括图神经网络处理空间关系、多代理验证、层次分解和因果记忆。它生成PDDL规范，基于符号反馈迭代精炼，并从执行踪迹学习建立知识库。

Result: 在6个标准IPC测试领域中，LOOP达到了85.8%的成功率，显著超过了LLM+P(55.0%)、LLM-as-Planner(19.2%)和Tree-of-Thoughts(3.3%)等现有方法。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不是在神经网络或符号推理器之间二选一，而是让它们在整个过程中相互对话。LOOP为构建可信赖的自主系统提供了详细的设计蓝图。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态的输入嵌入到统一的语义空间中，提升跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态参数高效微调方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中收敛，支持无缝集成新模态（如音频）而无需改变核心架构。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了有竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习的嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐嵌入结构（而非仅仅调整适配器权重）对于可扩展多模态学习的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理金融文档中高度非结构化的多页异构表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐机制，在表格检测性能上超越现有模型10.1%，并能显著提升提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界金融文档中的财务信息通常埋藏在混乱、多页、碎片化的表格中，99.4%的表格没有边界框，最大行数达426行，跨44页，传统方法难以有效处理这种高度非结构化的表格数据。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行任务，然后通过推荐代理审查输出、建议模式修订并决定最终推荐，实现持续学习过程。

Result: TASER在表格检测上比Table Transformer等现有模型提升10.1%；大批量处理使可操作的模式建议增加104.3%，提取的持仓量增加9.8%；构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元持仓的真实金融数据集TASERTab。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解真实世界金融表格方面具有巨大潜力，持续学习过程对提升提取效果至关重要，发布的TASERTab数据集将为研究社区提供宝贵的真实金融表格资源。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Motivation: 科学文献的指数增长和领域专门化限制了研究人员跨学科知识综合能力，需要更通用的AI系统来自主进行科学发现

Method: 基于领域无关的代理AI系统，自主设计和执行了三个心理学实验（视觉工作记忆、心理旋转、想象生动性），进行在线数据收集和分析管道开发

Result: 系统成功收集了288名参与者的数据，进行过8小时以上的连续编码工作，生成了完整的研究稿件，表现出与经验丰富研究人员相比的理论推理和方法论严谨性

Conclusion: 这是向能够通过实际实验测试假设的体现式AI的一步，有助于自主探索人类认知和资源限制无法涉足的科学领域，同时也引发了对科学理解本质和科学豪動归属问题的重要思考

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时空交通预测中复杂的时间模式、动态空间结构和多样化输入格式的挑战，克服传统Transformer模型在时间编码刚性和时空融合弱的问题。

Method: 提出四个模块：时间位置聚合器（TPA）用于模式感知时间编码，空间序列聚合器（SSA）用于序列空间学习，时空图匹配（STGM）用于跨域对齐，以及注意力混合器用于多尺度融合。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，STPFormer始终达到新的SOTA结果，消融实验和可视化证实了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: STPFormer通过创新的模块设计和统一的表征学习方法，成功解决了时空交通预测中的关键挑战，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world
datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation
and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决需要最坏情况性能要求的广泛优化问题，提供一个无上下文关联的数学形式化方法

Method: 定义DMMV问题数学模型，研究其数学性质，开发GPU加速贫估算法，并在三个实际应用场景中验证

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升14%，离散断层扫描中降低16%重建误差且GPU速度提升6倍，FIR滤波器设计中浮动波弦减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个通用优化问题框架具有重要价值，所提贫估算法在多个领域都取得显著效果，将开源以促进更多应用研究

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

TL;DR: 语言模型代理在安全知识与实际执行之间存在显著空间，研究构建了风险验证器系统来减少危险行动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别语言模型代理在安全意识与实际执行能力之间的缺口，这种缺口在安全关键场景中带来严重风险

Method: 开发了一个综合评估框架，从三个维度检查代理安全性：风险知识、执行轨迹中风险识别、实际行为避免。基于观察到的缺口，构建了风险验证器系统，包括抽象器将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述

Result: 发现代理在风险知识上表现彻底（>98%），但在实际场景中识别风险的能力下降23%，执行危险行动的次数仍高（<26%避免率）。风险验证器系统将危险行动执行减少55.3%

Conclusion: 简单扩大模型能力或推理计算并不能本质解决安全问题，需要专门的安全检查机制。风险验证器系统能够有效补充代理的安全执行缺口

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗文本理解方面表现出色，但在基于电子健康记录的预测任务中表现不佳，因为难以处理时间结构化和高维数据。现有方法通常依赖混合范式，无法提升LLM的内在推理能力。

Method: 提出EAG-RL两阶段训练框架：1）使用专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量逐步推理轨迹来初始化LLM策略；2）通过强化学习优化策略，将LLM的注意力与专家EHR模型识别的临床显著特征对齐。

Result: 在两个真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，EAG-RL平均提升LLM的EHR推理能力14.62%，同时增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，能够有效提升LLM在电子健康记录推理方面的内在能力。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在需要深度理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足，监督微调在图表到代码生成任务中存在性能瓶颈，需要有效的强化学习策略来奖励结构化输出。

Method: 构建包含300万真实图表-代码对的最大训练语料库，提出MSRL方法使用多粒度结构化奖励系统：文本级基于规则的奖励验证代码细节，视觉级基于模型的奖励通过渲染代码成图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性，采用两阶段课程学习保证训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破SFT性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准上分别将高级指标提升6.2%和9.9%，达到与先进闭源模型竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习能有效解决图表到代码生成中的性能瓶颈问题，结合文本和视觉反馈的多粒度奖励系统是提升结构化输出任务性能的有效方法。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

TL;DR: V2P方法通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决了GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心边缘区分问题，在ScreenSpot基准上达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法依赖边界框或中心点回归，忽略了空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构。现有注意力方法存在两个关键问题：(1)背景区域处理不当导致注意力漂移；(2)统一标注无法区分目标UI元素的中心和边缘，导致点击不精确。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制最小化对无关区域的关注；2) 基于Fitts定律将GUI交互建模为2D高斯热图，权重从中心向边缘递减，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试上分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。消融实验证实了各组件贡献，突显了V2P在精确GUI定位任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: V2P方法有效隔离目标区域并指导模型关注UI元素的最关键点，解决了GUI定位中的核心挑战，为精确GUI定位任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法主要处理一阶逻辑查询，但现实查询常包含模糊或上下文相关的软约束（如属性偏好），需要新的解决方案

Method: 提出神经查询重排序器(NQR)，通过增量学习偏好和非偏好实体示例来调整答案评分，不破坏原始查询结果

Result: 扩展了现有QA基准数据集，实验表明NQR能有效捕获软约束同时保持稳健的查询回答性能

Conclusion: 成功解决了知识图谱问答中软约束整合的问题，NQR方法为处理现实世界中的模糊偏好查询提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Result: 提出的ITL-LIME框架在数据稀缺环境下显著提高了解释的信度和稳定性

Conclusion: ITL-LIME通过实例转移学习有效解决了LIME在数据稀缺情况下的局限性，为黑盒模型提供了更准确稳定的本地解释

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,

Result: 实验结果验证了MHSNet的有效性。

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决简历重复检测的挑战，提升第三方简历质量并丰富公司人才库。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We

Motivation: 为神经符号AI提供一个统一的框架，抽象化常用的表示和计算机制，支持多种逻辑类型和实现方式。

Method: 开发DeepLog语言（基于一阶逻辑的神经扩展）和计算级组件（扩展代数电路），形成神经符号抽象机器。

Result: 实验比较显示DeepLog能够有效支持不同模糊和概率逻辑，在GPU上实现比CPU实现更高效。

Conclusion: DeepLog提供了一个通用且高效的神经符号AI框架，能够表示和模拟广泛的神经符号系统。

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过整合显式结构因果推理来改进LLM代理在协作任务中的规划能力，减少无效动作并提高协作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理（尤其是较小的开源模型）在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这限制了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，包含结构因果行动（SCA）模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策。该结构用于通过分配因果分数来指导行动选择，重新加权LLM生成的提议，或在需要时回退到基于因果的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试的五个多代理协调任务和四个不同规模的LLM（Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B和Llama-70B）上评估，CausalPlan持续减少无效动作并改善AI-AI和人类-AI设置中的协作，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多代理LLM系统的价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可约束规划为干预一致的行为。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Motivation: 单个大语言模型在医疗决策中存在参数知识限制和静态训练语料的局限性，无法有效整合复杂的临床信息

Method: 两阶段框架：1）专家感知代理招募 - 构建LLM专业表动态选择最优模型；2）置信度和对抗驱动的多代理协作 - 通过置信度融合和对抗验证整合响应

Result: 在三个公共MDM数据集上表现优异，在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比最佳闭源模型GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的代理招募策略和代理互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策系统的性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Method: 将观察到的实例化作为潜在语言的样本，使用概率上下文无关文法生成新的类似条次，可选地逆转学习到的条次概率以增加多样性

Result: 方法不仅能够模仿过去成功的实例化，还能通过探索多样性来平衡量词推理中的利用和探索

Conclusion: 该新题实例化方法通过动态学习现有技术和概率语言模型，为SMT求解器处理量化公式提供了一种有效的新方法

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成相关研究奠定了基础，揭示了集成方法在提升RAG框架适应性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思步骤和多程序选择的综合方法，可以有效提高LLM生成广义计划的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large

virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random

addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器代理与人类桌面环境之间的本质不匹配问题，并充分利用程序API调用和GUI交互来提升自主桌面操作能力。

Method: 提出API-GUI统一范式，构建分布式RL训练基础设施，支持千边并行虚拟桌面环境；提出Entropulse训练策略，交替进行强化学习和监督精细调整。

Result: 在OSWorld基准上，基于GLM-4-9B-0414的AutoGLM-OS-9B模型达到48.1%的准确率，创造了新的最高纪录，显示出在桌面自动化任务中的显著改进。

Conclusion: ComputerRL框架通过结合API和GUI交互、大规模分布式训练以及有效的训练策略，成功提升了自主桌面代理的性能和通用性，为桌面智能领域提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种扩展的演员级流水线，用于检测和减少大规模文本语料库中的性别偏见，通过新的演员级指标和排除基于平衡技术实现更公平的语料库构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型输出常带有来自训练数据的结构性性别不平衡问题，需要开发更有效的方法来检测和减少这些偏见。

Method: 基于话语意识公平性分析的前期工作，提出新的演员级指标，包括情感不对称性、句法主体性和引用风格的不对称性，支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于平衡技术。

Result: 在taz2024full德语报纸文章语料库(1980-2024)上应用证明，在多个语言维度上实现了性别平衡的显著改善，但情感和框架方面的隐蕴偏见仍持续存在。

Conclusion: 表面层面的不对称性可通过筛选和重新平衡来减少，但更细微的偏见形式仍需进一步研究，研究工具和报告已开源以支持进一步的话语基于公平性审计和公平语料库构建。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp是一个新的多模态网页浏览基准测试，包含224个手工制作的问题，专门评估AI代理的多模态检索和推理能力，现有最先进模型仅达到29.02%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页浏览基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注文本信息，忽略了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 创建包含224个挑战性问题的MM-BrowseComp基准，这些问题在提示中包含图像，且搜索推理过程中的关键信息可能嵌入在网页的图像或视频中。为每个问题提供验证清单以进行细粒度分析。

Result: 对最先进模型的综合评估显示，即使是OpenAI o3等顶级模型也仅达到29.02%的准确率，表明当前模型的多模态能力不足且缺乏原生多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在多模态网页浏览任务中表现不佳，凸显了开发具有更强多模态检索和推理能力的模型的迫切需求。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于RNN-T的ASR系统能够实时转写，但实现实时流媒体翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要找到翻译质量和延迟之间的有效平衡。

Method: 提出同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索管理上下文，采用高效的束搜索剪枝技术（如超时和强制终止）来维持系统的实时性能。

Result: 在设备上双语对话语音翻译中应用，在延迟和质量方面都超过了基线方法，缩小了与非流媒体翻译系统的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该技术为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译开启了新路径，有力推动语音翻译技术的实时应用。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理能力对大型语言模型习语检测性能的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且多变，大模型能更好理解习语含义，而小模型通过提供定义提示可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理能力如何影响LLMs的习语检测性能，以及模型规模对推理效果的影响，因为习语理解需要先理解后推理的逻辑步骤。

Method: 评估DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上的表现，分析链式思维推理的效果，并尝试为小模型提供定义提示。

Result: 推理效果较小且多变：小模型通过CoT推理可从数学调优模型提升性能但不及基础模型，大模型（14B+）有适度提升；大模型能准确生成习语定义，小模型常失败；为小模型提供定义提示可在某些情况下改善性能。

Conclusion: 模型规模对习语理解至关重要，大模型展现出更好的语义理解能力，而小模型需要外部知识辅助才能达到更好的习语检测性能。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转诖中常常无法维持语法和语义的准确性，影响命名实体识别、大写化和标点等任务的性能

Method: 采用两种策略：(1)使用最优运输进行标记级正则化来对齐维度和序列长度，(2)最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入之间的表示损失，融合语法和语义信息

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上评估显示，在单词误差率(WER)、命名实体识别(NER)、大写化和标点等方面取得显著改善

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知ASR，该方法强调了将语言上下文集成到转诖中的价值，为长形式语音的稳健、上下文感知ASR设置了基础

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于虚拟数据分析和研究生级别问题求解。该模型通过轨迹式训练、双奖励框架和GRPO优化，在多个定量领域表现出色，准确率提升30%，同时减少18-49%的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在复杂问题求解中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理不连贯等问题，提供更高效、准确的分析能力。

Method: 使用轨迹中心合成数据生成器创建14.4万个标记笔记本片段；采用双奖励框架（结构信号+分层奖励模型）；实施内存优化的GRPO算法；支持双推理接口（代理模式和反思模式）。

Result: 在标准基准测试中超越同规模模型，达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平；AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench准确率提升30%；每个解决方案减少18-49%的token使用。

Conclusion: Datarus通过创新的训练方法和架构设计，成功实现了高效、准确的研究生级别问题求解能力，避免了传统RL对齐模型的常见问题。

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLM在跨文化交流中存在的语言和观点偏向问题，因为文化对齐面临文化知识有限和有效学习方法缺乏的挑战

Method: 采用参数效率微调技术，基于Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词语联想规范，通过监督微调(SFT)和PPO偏好优化对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行适配

Result: SFT在英语中提升P@5 16-20%，普通话中提升43-165%，提高具体性+0.20，达到人类水平的情绪价值。价值观问卷中答案分布向目标文化偏移，Qwen中国对齐回复倍增，Llama美国偏向降低1/3

Conclusion: 7-8B模型性能可以比较或超迈原始70B模型，证明少量文化基础关联数据能够以低成本方式实现价值对齐，强调了基于人类认知的文化对齐研究的前景和必要性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动信息收集能力，在临床交互场景中存在误诊风险，需要转向主动提问范式

Method: 提出基于强化学习的ProMed框架，使用Shapley信息增益(SIG)奖励量化问题临床价值，包含SIG引导模型初始化和SIG增强策略优化两阶段训练流程

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: ProMed成功实现了医疗LLM从被动到主动范式的转变，通过SIG奖励机制有效提升了模型在交互式医疗场景中的诊断准确性和实用性

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语LLM主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语(MSA)，对沙特方言如Najdi和Hijazi支持有限，影响了真实方言变体的抓取能力

Method: 使用私有沙特方言指令数据集(5,466条合成数据)，采用LoRA微调ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview模型：1)方言标签训练(在指令前添加明确方言标签)；2)无标签训练

Result: 方言标签模型表现最佳：沙特方言生成率从47.97%提升到84.21%，MSA泄漏率从32.63%降至6.21%，文本保真度显著提升。两种LoRA方法都超过多个基线模型

Conclusion: 通过方言标签技术可以有效提升阿拉伯语LLM的方言生成能力，为少数语言变体的人工智能支持提供了有效方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对大型语言模型在低资源语言（如泰卢固语）能力的细粒度评估，需要了解模型在非英语语言中的实际表现和局限性。

Method: 构建包含729个多项选择题和开放式问题的泰卢固语评估数据集MATA，评估11个LLM模型，分析模型在多项选择题中对答案位置和干扰项模式的依赖，比较LLM作为评判者与人类评估的一致性。

Result: 研究显示LLM在泰卢固语任务中表现存在局限，模型倾向于使用表面启发式方法而非深层语言理解，LLM作为评判者与人类评估在低资源语言中存在可靠性问题。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性至关重要，可以为开发更具语言能力的LLM提供信息，同时为泰卢固语NLP的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注压缩对模型精度的影响，而忽视了性能平等是否能保证信任等效性。论文强调在资源约束环境中部署压缩模型时，需要更全面地评估其可信赖性。

Method: 提出两维评估框架：1)解释性对齐（使用LIME和SHAP测试）量化模型是否基于相同特征做决策；2)检验准确性相似性（通过ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图评估）量化模型预测概率的可靠性。实验使用BERT-base模型及其压缩版本，在自然语言推理和同义识别任务上进行测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使压缩模型与原始模型的精度几乎相同，但解释性对齐度很低，检验准确性也存在显著差异。这说明压缩模型并不与大模型信任等效。

Conclusion: 压缩模型不能简单地作为大模型的直接替代品部署。在实际部署时，需要超越精度平等的更全面信任评估，确保压缩模型的决策逻辑和可靠性与原始模型保持一致。

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

Result: 确定性策略普遍优于随机策略，beam search得分最高；大模型整体得分更高但推理时间更长且对解码策略不更鲁棒；医疗LLM在2/5任务中优于通用模型但无整体优势；MAUVE与其他指标相关性弱且对解码策略更敏感

Conclusion: 解码策略选择在医疗应用中至关重要，其影响有时甚至超过模型选择，需要谨慎选择解码方法以确保输出质量

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

*Dariia Puhach,Amir H. Payberah,Éva Székely*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究语音大语言模型(Speech-LLMs)的性别偏见问题，通过分析Bark TTS模型的默认说话人分配来识别模型中的性别偏吐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然语音大语言模型与文本LLMs都具有出色能力和上下文意识，但是是否同样存在性别偏见仍不确定。语音模型必须生成具有性别特征的声音，使得说话人选择成为显性偏见线索。

Method: 构建两个数据集：(i)职业数据集（含性别刻板化职业），(ii)性别色彩词汇数据集（含性别含义词汇）。分析Bark TTS模型对文本提示的默认说话人分配。

Result: Bark模型没有显示系统性偏见，但显示出了性别意识和某些性别倾向性。

Conclusion: 语音大语言模型虽然不存在系统性性别偏见，但仍具有性别意识，需要继续监测和研究以避免潜在偏见问题。

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现持久性的概念遗忘，通过自动识别并抑制多个层中的显著特征来移除有害知识，同时保持模型的其他能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除不需要的知识同时保持模型效用。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时操作，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层中的显著特征，并抑制这些特征的激活，实现参数高效的持久概念遗忘。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示该方法实现了目标概念与良性概念的语义分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级持久概念遗忘方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，为大语言模型的安全部署提供了重要技术手段。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViExam基准测试，首次全面评估了视觉语言模型在越南语多模态教育考试中的表现，发现当前最先进的VLMs在跨语言多模态推理任务上表现不佳，平均准确率仅为57.74%，远低于人类平均水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在英语多模态任务上表现出色，但其在低资源语言（如越南语）的真实多模态教育内容上的性能尚未得到充分探索，需要评估VLMs处理真实跨语言多模态推理的能力。

Method: 构建ViExam基准测试，包含2,548个多模态问题，涵盖7个学术领域；测试多种VLMs模型性能；比较跨语言提示和人在回路协作的效果。

Result: SOTA VLMs平均准确率57.74%，开源模型27.70%；仅o3思考模型(74.07%)超过人类平均水平(66.54%)，但远低于人类最佳表现(99.60%)；跨语言提示反而降低性能1个百分点；人在回路协作可提升5个百分点。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在越南语多模态教育评估中表现不足，跨语言能力有限，需要进一步发展多语言多模态理解和推理能力，人在回路协作是提升性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

*James Ravi Kirkpatrick,Rachel Katharine Sterken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了28个大语言模型在20种可反操作的默认推理模式上的表现，发现强大模型在默认推理方面有一定能力，但CoT提示经常导致性能下降，且大部分模型无法区分默认推理和形式逻辑推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用性语句（如'鸟会飞'）在语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学中具有重要地位，它们允许异常情况且是默认推理、认知和概念获取的核心。研究者想了解LLM如何处理这种复杂的可反操作推理。

Method: 使用28个大语言模型评估20种不同的可反操作默认推理模式，测试了不同提示方式（零次提示、少次提示、链式思维提示）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在默认推理问题上表现良好，但性能在不同模型和提示方式下差异显著。少次提示对某些模型有轻微改善，但链式思维提示导致严重性能下降（在零次提示准确率超过75%的模型中，平均准确率下降11.14%，标准差15.74%）。大部分模型无法区分默认推理和形式逻辑推理，或将通用性语句误解为普遍语句。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型在默认推理方面既有潜力也有限制，尤其是在处理可反操作逻辑和通用性语句的细致区别方面。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了通过预测准确度来评估词嵌入中语义知识编码的常见方法，证明即使随机信息也能被成功预测，表明这种方法主要反映向量空间几何相似性而非真正的语义属性涌现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度学习模型中隐式编码的知识对于提高AI系统可解释性至关重要，但现有方法假设从词嵌入准确预测语义特征就意味着嵌入包含相应知识，这一假设需要验证

Method: 分析常见词嵌入解释方法，通过实验证明这些方法能够成功预测随机信息，揭示预测准确度主要受算法上限约束而非真实语义表示

Result: 预测准确度不能可靠指示真正的基于特征的可解释性，比较不同数据集时仅依赖预测性能无法可靠判断哪个数据集被词嵌入更好捕获

Conclusion: 词嵌入到语义特征的映射主要反映向量空间内的几何相似性，不能可靠表明语义属性的真正涌现，需要开发更可靠的方法来评估嵌入中的知识编码

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Motivation: 随着脑电图(EEG)在神经科学和临床实践中的广泛应用，如何高效检索和语义解释大规模、多源、异构的EEG数据成为一个紧迫挑战。

Method: 提出EEG-MedRAG框架，将EEG领域知识、个体病例和大规模存储库统一到一个可遍历的n元关系超图中，实现联合语义-时间检索和因果链诊断生成。同时建立了首个跨疾病、跨角色的EEG临床QA基准。

Conclusion: EEG-MedRAG框架为解决大规模EEG数据的语义检索和临床解释问题提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型的奉扰性问题，圧程调整方法能有效减少模型在科学问答中的奉扰行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域常出现奉扰性（无条件尊重用户信念），这在科学问答等高风险场景中带来严重风险

Method: 提出统一评估框架来量化奉扰性影响，并设计Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对话数据上进行谨慎拓展来增强模型的奉扰抵抗力

Result: 系统性评估显示奉扰性在各种模型中普遍存在，而Pressure-Tune能显著提升奉扰抵抗力且不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力

Conclusion: 奉扰性是大语言模型的重要问题，Pressure-Tune提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在保持模型准确性的同时提升其事实一致性和原则性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

TL;DR: MGT-Prism是一种从频域角度检测机器生成文本的方法，通过低频域过滤和动态频谱对齐策略来提高跨域泛化性能，在11个测试数据集上平均准确率和F1分数分别提升0.90%和0.92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在相同领域训练测试时表现良好，但在面对未见领域时由于领域偏移而泛化能力差，需要开发更好的跨域泛化检测方法。

Method: 从频域角度分析文本表示，发现不同领域间存在一致的频谱模式，但机器生成文本与人类撰写文本在幅度上存在显著差异。设计了低频域过滤模块过滤对领域偏移敏感的文档级特征，以及动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和领域不变的特征。

Result: 在三个领域泛化场景的11个测试数据集上，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism通过频域特征处理有效解决了跨域泛化问题，在多个测试场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型生成文本是否类似儿童语言，以了解LLM在教育和心理语言学研究中的适用性

Method: 使用雷同图片故事生成两个LLM语料库（零械提示和少数提示），与德语儿童描述语料库进行对比分析，包括词频、词汇丰富度、句长、词性标注和语义相似性等心理语言学属性

Result: LLM生成文本更长但词汇稀缺，更多依赖高频词汇，名词使用不足，语义空间分析显示低相似性，少数提示仅轻微提升相似性但仍无法复现词汇和语义模式

Conclusion: LLM在模仿儿童语言方面有限，这对于理解LLM在教育应用中的适宜性和在心理语言学研究中的使用有重要意义，并引发对LLM生成语言在儿童教育工具中适宜性的质疑

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成医学摘要时的事实准确性担忧，通过提供句子级引用让用户能够追溯原始证据来源

Method: 提出Track-Then-Sum摘要管道，先进行句子级追踪再进行摘要生成；建立包含7个关键医学方面的标注数据集和4个评估指标

Result: 实验表明TracSum可作为有效的基准，显式执行句子级追踪能提高生成准确性，包含完整上下文能进一步提升完整性

Conclusion: TracSum基准和评估框架为可追溯的基于方面摘要任务提供了有效解决方案，追踪机制对提高医学摘要准确性至关重要

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究多使用确定性的真实标签（如多数决或包含规则），无法抓取人类注释者的不一致性。本研究旨在通过模型化注释者分歧来更全面地评估语言模型的道德理解能力。

Method: 采用GPU优化的贝叶斯框架，处理了100万+文本的25万+注释，包括社交媒体、新闻和论坛内容。评估了Claude Sonnet 4、DeepSeek-V3、Llama 4 Maverick等顶级语言模型，模型化了时机性不确定性和认知不确定性。

Result: AI模型通常排在人类注释者前25%，平衡准确率远超平均水平。关键发现是AI产生的假阻性错误显著少于人类，显示出更敏感的道德检测能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究为语言模型的道德理解能力提供了更精细的评估方法，证明了现代AI模型在道德检测方面的优势，尤其在减少漏检错误方面表现突出。

Abstract: How do large language models understand moral dimensions compared to humans?
  This first large-scale Bayesian evaluation of market-leading language models
provides the answer. In contrast to prior work using deterministic ground truth
(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法准确控制文本长度，要么超过要求要么不足，需要一种轻量级的解决方案

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次投射策略，通过在提示中添加计数器标记和明确的计数规则，让模型在生成文本时同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从不到30%提升到超过95%，超越了流行的草稿-然后修订基线方法，同时保持了评估质量

Conclusion: 精确的长度控制可以仅通过提示工程实现，提供了一种轻量级的替代方案，避免了训练或解码基于方法的复杂性

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

TL;DR: 自动评价指标在NLG预测人类判断时存在显著问题，无论是传统指标还是LLM评估都无法成为普遍解决方案，需要根据具体任务选择指标并重视验证方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评价指标在自然语言生成预测人类判断时存在显著问题，并无普遍适用的指标，需要系统性分析现有指标的限制和验证方法

Method: 通过系统性检查现有评价指标的方法论、文档化优势、限制、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性，包括最新的LLM-as-a-Judge方法和RAG任务评估

Result: 发现评价指标通常只能测量文本质量的特定方面，效果随任务和数据集而异，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断的相关性不一致，这些问题在最新的LLM评估方法中仍然存在

Conclusion: 对完美评价指标的追求是不实际的，应根据具体任务需求选择指标，采用补充性评估方法，并为新指标开发更强化的验证方法论

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型在科学领域的综合性评估基准，解决了现有基准在多语言推理、多模态覆盖和细粒度知识标注方面的不足，包含1019个高质量问题对，覆盖4个学科和5种语言，实验显示对现有模型具有很大挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域的多模态大语言模型评估基准存在三个关键问题：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、多模态覆盖评估不充分、科学知识点缺乏细粒度标注。

Method: 收集了1019个高质量问答对，涉及3种评估模式，覆盖数学、物理、化学、生物四个学科，支持中英法西日五种语言，在16个开源模型和4个闭源模型上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果表明MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有很大挑战性，例如在仅图像评估模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，通过其多语言和细粒度知识属性，能够深入分析现有模型在特定领域的弱点，为多模态大语言模型在科学领域的发展提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架通过智能的上下文片段选择和DPO优化，有效提升了LLM的长上下文建模能力

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

Motivation: 传统RLVR训练在提升Pass@1性能的同时会导致策略熵下降，降低生成多样性并限制Pass@k性能

Method: 提出在线自对弈变分问题合成策略(SvS)，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，保持参考答案不变

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准上Pass@32性能分别提升18.3%和22.8%，在12个推理基准上均表现优异

Conclusion: SvS策略能有效维持训练过程中的策略熵，显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的Pass@k性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: 大语言模型向代理系统演化过程中，细调可能导致对齐的LLM失去安全性，更容易执行有害任务且拒绝澄率下降。当前细调过程对安全问题关注不够。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法：在代理响应前添加自动生成的自然语言前缀，通过迭代方法在生成候选前缀和选择优化任务性能与拒绝行为之间找到平衡。

Result: 实验结果显示PING在保持良性任务性能的同时显著提升了安全性，在网页导航和代码生成任务中都超过现有提示方法。线性探针分析显示前缀token对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单有效的方法，能够在不爆弹性能的前提下显著提高细调LLM代理的安全性，解决了代理细调中被忽视的安全风险。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其在不同任务类别中成功实现上下文学习的具体机制仍不明确。物理任务提供了一个理想的测试平台，因为物理系统基于基本原理的结构化动力学提供了实验可控的真实数据。

Method: 使用物理系统中的动力学预测任务作为代理任务，评估LLMs能否在上下文中学习物理。通过分析模型残差流激活，使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)来揭示能力涌现机制。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个新颖的案例研究，拓宽了我们对LLMs如何在上下文中学习的理解，证明了物理概念在模型内部的编码机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

Motivation: 现有的疲劣检测方法存在侵入性强、硬件依赖性高、小物体检测难、多尺度特征建模不足等问题，需要一种高效、轻量化的视觉方案来应用于真实驾驶环境。

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR提供了一种实用且高性能的车内疲劣监测方案，具有强大的实际部署潜力，可以进一步扩展时间序列建模、多模态数据融合和嵌入式优化。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Conclusion: Mirage-R1通过创新的推理机制和训练策略，有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测的挑战，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在端到端文档图像解析方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（生成输入图像中不存在的文本），且在OCR任务上不如专门训练的专家模型有效。需要一种方法来结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出DianJin-OCR-R1框架，训练推理与工具交织的视觉语言模型。模型首先利用自身OCR能力识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并重新思考推理过程，提供最终的识别内容。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验结果表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过推理增强和工具调用机制，DianJin-OCR-R1成功解决了大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，同时利用专家模型的优势提升了OCR性能，为视觉语言模型在文档解析任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Conclusion: 组件基于分类结合卷积神经网络的方法能够有效处理乌尔都语的复杂字符识别问题，适用于草书体语言的光学字符识别

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声问题，且现有模型常忽略评分的序数特性，需要开发能同时处理标签可靠性和序数结构的分类方法。

Method: 提出CLoE课程学习框架：1)使用轻量级模型基于BBPS标签估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理；2)按从易(干净)到难(噪声)的顺序组织样本；3)结合ResizeMix增强提高鲁棒性；4)在CNN和Transformer架构上验证。

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的序数分类性能，CLoE框架具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中的视觉语言模型处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致推理延迟和内存消耗急剧增加，阻碍了实际部署

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）基于最远点采样的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据每个摄像头视图对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例

Result: 在DriveLM和DriveLMM-o1基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token即可实现6.4倍预填充阶段加速，FLOPs降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为自动驾驶视觉语言模型的实际部署提供了有效的计算优化解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且尚不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架，每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标(SSIM、LPIPS、FID)均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical

identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

TL;DR: 研究发现多选VQA基准存在Easy-Options Bias问题，模型仅凭视觉和选项就能猜对答案，无需问题。提出GroundAttack工具生成困难负选项，创建无偏数据集，使模型表现更接近真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有VQA基准存在严重偏差，视觉语言模型可以通过视觉-选项相似性匹配直接猜出正确答案，无需理解问题，这导致对模型真实问答能力的高估。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差原因，提出GroundAttack工具自动生成视觉上合理但困难的负选项，应用于NExT-QA和MMStar数据集创建无偏标注。

Result: 在无偏标注上，当前VLMs在仅视觉+选项设置下准确率接近随机，在完整设置下准确率也显著下降，提供了更真实的模型能力评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提出的解决方案能创建更公平的评估环境，有助于真实反映视觉语言模型的问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Conclusion: 高效的知识蓄粉和结构化多代理监督能够使轻量级VLM拥有复杂推理能力。VISTA的紧凑架构便于在边缘设备上高效部署，实现实时风险监控，而无需大规模基础设施升级。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了面部特征解耦和跨模态共享的问题，为可控说话头生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

TL;DR: 视觉Transformer模型在肾结石内镜图像分类任务中显著超越传统CNN模型，在复杂图像条件下准确率提升近30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肾结石分类对个性化治疗和预防复发至关重要，但CNN模型在抓取长距离依赖关系方面有限，影响在变化的成像条件下的性能

Method: 使用ImageNet-21k预训练的ViT-base模型与ResNet50基线模型进行对比分析，评估在两个ex vivo数据集（CCD相机和缓性屏状内镜图像）上的表现

Result: ViT模型在所有成像条件下均超过ResNet50。在最复杂的内镜图像子集中，ViT达到95.2%准确率和95.1% F1分数，而ResNet50仅有64.5%和59.3%。在混合视图子集中，ViT达到87.1%准确率，CNN为78.4%

Conclusion: ViT基于的架构提供了更优异的分类性能，为肾结石图像分析提供了可扩展的CNN替代方案

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层来高效编码多张图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示(INR)在处理多图像时计算和存储效率低下的问题

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，共享相似的中间层，保留输入输出层为图像专用，并添加投影层捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数，处理100张图像时平均PSNR保持34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法有效且鲁棒，能够高效处理多图像编码任务

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，同时量化权重和激活值，通过哈达玛变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布后应用标准量化器，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活值分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1)分析发现INRs中首尾层权重分布与中间层不同，最后一层激活值与前面层显著差异；2)使用哈达玛变换将这些不同分布标准化为统一的钟形分布；3)应用标准量化器进行量化；4)在FPGA上实现硬件高效方案。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上的实验表明，DHQ优于先前量化方法，相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率降低高达98.3%。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化方案有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值的分布差异问题，实现了显著的硬件效率提升，为INRs的硬件部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效增强了INRs的鲁棒性，为解决INRs在实际部署中的脆弱性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过多任务学习和注意力机制有效提取了微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能，为解决微表情识别的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Conclusion: CORENet通过跨模态监督成功解决了4D雷达数据稀疏和噪声问题，为恶劣天气条件下的自动驾驶感知提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Motivation: 多视图聚类需要更好地学习视图间的一致性和互补性，同时现有方法往往忽略了面向聚类的表示学习

Method: 包含三个模块：多视图实例学习（对齐一致信息并保留私有特征）、双级特征与簇解耦（增强特征空间和簇空间的区分性）、一致性学习（处理样本不同视图及其邻居作为正对，学习聚类分配一致性）

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明该方法优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过有效的表示学习显著提升了多视图聚类的性能

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO的复杂交互作用，且没有考虑动态场景中的运动模糊效应，导致高ISO产生噪声而长快门速度引起模糊

Method: 采用强化学习算法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图来动态选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列

Result: 在多个数据集上进行实验，证明该方法达到了目前最先进的性能水平

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算，选择比传统方案更好的曝光策略，有效提升了动态环境中的HDR重建质量

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

TL;DR: VGQ是一种新的图像tokenizer范式，通过将2D高斯分布整合到视觉码本量化框架中，显式增强结构建模能力，显著提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化tokenizer（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，往往忽略几何结构，因为其基于patch的设计。需要将更多视觉信息整合到tokenizer中。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将图像潜在表示编码为2D高斯分布，直接建模位置、旋转和尺度等结构相关参数，有效捕捉几何和空间结构。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256基准测试中，VGQ实现了rFID 1.00的重建质量。通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步达到rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的SOTA性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过整合2D高斯分布，成功解决了传统量化方法在结构建模方面的局限性，在token效率和视觉丰富度之间提供了灵活的权衡。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as

VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DGS基于方法在捕获细细微面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高度可变形区域

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，使用少量关键高斯影响邻近高斯的变形；利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供面部几何结构指导

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够产生更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，具有更好的表情可控性和细节保真度

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知的设计，有效提升了高保真头部虚拟人重建的质量，在表情捕获和纹理连续性方面取得显著改善

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR是一种新的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制，解决了现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题，在2D图像表示/恢复和3D重建任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，过度依赖冗余信号分量，存在频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间局部化；2) WEGE编码，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数来显式指导频率信息

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复、3D重建任务中持续优于现有INRs方法

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率和局部性感知机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中实现，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级生成式人脸视频编码框架，通过双模式优化技术在保持重建质量的同时大幅降低了模型参数和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成式人脸视频编码在码率扩展性能上优势显著，但大型模型的参数量和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。需要一种轻量化方案来支持资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 采用双模式优化策略：(1)架构重设-用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；(2)两阶段适配性通道剪枝-训练时通过可学习阈值进行软剪枝识别冗余通道，训练后使用导出的掩码进行硬剪枝永久删除。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法与基线相比能够减少590.4%的参数量和88.9%的计算开销，同时在感知质量指标上超过最新视频编码标准VVC。

Conclusion: 该轻量化双模式优化方法为生成式人脸视频编码在移动边缘设备等资源受限环境中的高效部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法有效增加刻度信号信息量并提升SNN性能

Conclusion: 这种生物受灵的方法有望突破神经科学计算当前限制，推动SNN更广泛应用

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DictAS是一个新颖的少样本异常分割框架，通过自监督学习将字典查找能力迁移到未见类别，无需目标数据重新训练，仅使用少量正常参考图像作为视觉提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖于已知异常样本的先验知识，需要寻找更有效的泛化方法。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（使用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）。

Result: 在七个工业和医疗数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了对未见类别的有效异常检测，无需重新训练，展现了优异的跨类别泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify虽然稳健但计算成本高，受其他领域启发，希望通过数据驱动神经网络替代迭代优化来提高效率。

Method: 提出时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对，采用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了实用简单的基线，显著提升效率而不牺牲精度，具有良好的泛化能力和模型无关性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Result: 在4个公开RVOS测试集上一致达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过优化分割头设计、删除噪声预测模块以及提出TCMR模块，在不增加复杂性的情况下显著提升了分割质量，为RVOS领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 汇泰扩散-GAN混合方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在极端条件下的感知鲁棒性

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: MaMe为各种SSM应用提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，在保持序列建模能力的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Method: 提出FoundationSSC框架，在源头和路径层面进行双重解耦：基础编码器提供语义特征优先和立体成本体积，通过专门化路径精炼，使用混合视图变换生成互补3D特征，并通过轴向感知融合模块进行合并

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计能够有效地解决语义和几何优先之间的矛盾，实现了同时在语义和几何指标上的显著提升

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

*Tianyi Niu,Jaemin Cho,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在图片旋转识别任务中表现差强，尤其无法区分90度和270度旋转，显示了与人类视觉理解能力的显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLM模型在图片旋转识别任务中的视觉理解能力，详细分析它们如何检测和理解空间关系

Method: 构建RotBench标准数据集（350张图片），测试多个独立和商业MLLM模型，使用辅助信息和链式思绪提示等方法进行改进尝试

Result: 模型在0度图片识别表现良好，180度某些模型可以识别，但90度和270度旋转完全无法区分，细调也无法改善这一问题

Conclusion: MLLM模型在空间理解能力上与人类存在显著差距，需要更深入的研究来提升对视觉空间关系的理解

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Motivation: 在COVID-19大流行期间，现有智能门禁系统缺乏口罩检测功能，需要开发能够同时处理面部识别和口罩检测的IoT解决方案

Method: 使用树莓派平台，采用局部二值模式直方图(LBPH)算法进行全面部识别，修改LBPH算法进行遮挡面部检测，通过Telegram实现远程控制和自动报警机制

Result: 系统在所有测试用户中平均达到约70%的准确率、80%的精确度和83.26%的召回率，能够有效进行人脸识别和口罩检测

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的限制。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集，并创建分层评估集TalkVid-Bench来平衡关键人口统计和语言维度。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于基于先前数据集的模型，表现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力，同时TalkVid-Bench揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估集为解决音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了平衡数据集和细致评估的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Motivation: 解决当前RGB-D方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中面临的挑战，提供一种仅依赖RGB图像的类别级物体姿势估计方案

Method: 设计变换器基础的神经网络预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，使用几何特征导向算法确保特征准确描述物体形状，最终通过RANSAC-PnP算法计算姿势

Result: 在标准数据集上进行实验，方法不仅高效而且在精度上超过之前的RGB基础方法

Conclusion: 该方法为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的视角，在实际应用场景中具有强大潜力

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成任务中对引导权重选择高度敏感，生成质量不稳定。作者发现这是由于训练和推理阶段之间存在显著差距，这种差距影响了条件生成性能。

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，这是一种基于优化的方法，在推理过程中通过迭代误差最小化来减少累积误差。该方法在每个推理步骤中进行误差优化，是一个即插即用的优化框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，DiffIER方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，并在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个任务中取得了一致的成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效解决了扩散模型中的训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法主要关注服装，缺乏对其他可穿戴物品（如珠宝、配饰）的支持，且需要掩码输入，限制了实际应用。需要开发一个统一的框架来处理各类可穿戴物品的无掩码试穿。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模未配对图像训练无掩码定位模型，通过重新利用修复模型在空白掩码上自动绘制物品；第二阶段用少量配对图像微调，保持物品外观一致性。

Result: 在包含12类常见可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和ID保持方面均优于现有方法，且第一阶段训练后模型即使使用少量配对样本也能快速收敛。

Conclusion: OmniTry成功扩展了虚拟试穿的应用范围，能够处理各种可穿戴物品的无掩码试穿，为解决数据配对难题提供了有效解决方案，具有很好的实用性和推广价值。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at
https://omnitry.github.io/.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了DeH4R模型，通过结合图生成效率和图增长动态性的混合方案，解决了远感图像中路网抽取的拖拖问题，在保持快速推理的同时提升了拓扑保真度和空间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前路网抽取方法存在三类问题：分割方法向量化后拓扑保真度低，图增长方法计算成本高，图生成方法无法动态插入顶点。需要一种新的混合方案来充分利用各方法优势。

Method: 提出DeH4R混合模型，将任务解耦为四个步骤：候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展。这种架构创新允许动态插入顶点（边），同时保持快速推理速度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet标准数据集上进行了全面评估，展示了最先进的性能。DeH4R在CityScale上比之前最佳图增长方法RNGDet++提升了4.62 APLS和10.18 IoU，同时速度提升约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R通过创新的混合架构成功地解决了远感图像路网抽取的关键挑战，在拓扑保真度、空间一致性和计算效率方面都取得了显著改善，为该领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

TL;DR: HumanPCR是一个评估多模态大模型在人类相关视觉上下文理解能力的三层次评估套件，包含感知、理解和推理三个层级，包含6000+人工验证的多选题和视频推理测试，评估显示现有模型在人类中心视觉理解方面仍面临重大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，现有基准测试经常忽视人类相关视觉理解的关键技能。

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两者包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；后者提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据和主动提取上下文。每个问题都包含人工标注的思维链推理。

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，在人类中心视觉理解方面存在显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。模型在从多样化人类场景中提取主动视觉证据方面表现挣扎，过度依赖查询引导检索。即使使用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，收益也有限。

Conclusion: HumanPCR评估套件和发现将推动多模态模型的开发、评估和人类中心应用的发展，揭示了当前模型在人类相关视觉理解方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，半监督分割技术通过利用未标注数据生成伪标签来缓解这个问题。最近的状态空间模型（如Mamba）在处理长距离依赖方面表现出色，因此探索其在半监督医学图像分割中的潜力

Method: 1. 数据角度：开发基于Mamba扫描特性的patch级弱-强混合增强
2. 网络角度：引入多样扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向产生的预测差异
3. 特征角度：采用不确定性加权的对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度多样性增强，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了状态空间模型在该领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

TL;DR: 提出了IPGA攻击方法，通过利用投影器模块的中间阶段（Q-Former）进行对抗攻击，实现了更精细的视觉语义控制，在全局图像描述和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法将丰富的视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，限制了攻击粒度，且忽视了投影器模块在视觉-语言对齐中的关键作用，导致攻击效果有限。

Method: 提出Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA)，首次利用投影器模块中间阶段（Q-Former）进行攻击，将全局图像嵌入转换为细粒度视觉特征；提出Residual Query Alignment (RQA)来保留无关视觉内容。

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中均优于现有方法，成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过操作语义有意义的视觉标记而非单一全局表示，实现了更精确的对抗扰动控制，提高了攻击效果和跨VLM的迁移性。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序用随机噪声掩码除一张图像外的所有图像；2）重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural

### [132] [MR6D: Benchmarking 6D Pose Estimation for Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13775)
*Anas Gouda,Shrutarv Awasthi,Christian Blesing,Lokeshwaran Manohar,Frank Hoffmann,Alice Kirchheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人设计的6D姿态估计数据集，针对工业环境中大尺寸物体、远距离视角和复杂遮挡等挑战，填补了现有数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机械臂操作的小型家用物体，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中面对大尺寸物体、远距离感知和复杂遮挡等特殊需求。

Method: 创建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置和大尺寸物体等挑战。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D姿态估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍，验证了该数据集对移动机器人应用的重要性。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了工业环境6D姿态估计数据集的空白，数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

*Agniva Sengupta,Stefan Zachow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法，用于将三维形状非簧凑地注册到多相机系统观测到的二维关键点。该方法通过使用广义相机模型和三种不同的接近方法，实现了更高的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将三维形状注册到二维关键点（Shape-from-Template）在单相机情况下已经得到广泛研究，但多相机系统能够为医学成像和手持相机注册等应用领域带来新的可能性。但目前缺少针对广义相机模型的SfT解决方案。

Method: 使用广义相机模型表示多相机系统，提出三种不同的接近方法：1）知道三维空间点的方向向量法；2）未知三维点但知道方向的方法；3）结合边缘信息的方法。前两种使用凸规划求解，第三种使用迭代精化。

Result: 在多个合成和实际数据集上验证了方法的准确性，证明了通过多视图相互约束可以提高变形形状估计的精度。

Conclusion: 这是首批解决基于广义相机模型的SfT问题的方法，为多相机三维形状注册提供了有效的解决方案，在医学成像和计算机视觉领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过视觉观察推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，利用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，并通过视觉模拟评估一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，要么使用神经网络建模内在动力学导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略，LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律；下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制，通过视觉模拟评估生成定律与底层内在动力学的一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，实现了可解释且泛化能力强的内在动力学推断。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

TL;DR: Med-CTX是一个基于Transformer的多模态乳腺癌超声分割框架，整合临床放射学报告提升性能和可解释性，在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型性能并提供临床依据的解释。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码的BI-RADS语义临床文本，通过跨模态注意力机制融合多模态特征。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线方法，多模态对齐CLIP分数85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%。

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，临床文本在分割准确性和解释质量中起关键作用。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Hyeongboo Baek,Brent ByungHoon Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗膜电位重用技术，在保持攻击成功率的同时将攻击延迟减少了超过56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳变神经网络(SNN)对抗攻击方法存在攻击延迟过大的问题，不适用于实际实时应用。这主要是因为它们直接扩展自ANN框架，没有利用SNN的关键特性。

Method: 提出TCA框架，包含两个核心组件：1)时间步级反向传播(TLBP)，发现生成干扰的全局时间信息并非关键，支持按时间步评估和提前停止；2)对抗膜电位重用(A-MPR)，通过预计算和重用初始时间步的膜电位积累来提高效率。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别将攻击延迟减少56.6%和57.1%，同时保持相当的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过利用SNN的特有性质，有效解决了现有攻击方法的延迟问题，为实际实时应用提供了可行的高效对抗攻击方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

TL;DR: 无监督聚类框架结合街道级图像和空间植装模式，无需标签数据即可估算城市树木生物多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候遭退性和生态稳定至关重要，但现有量付方法成本高、普适性差，需要一种可扩展的低成本方案

Method: 无监督聚类框架，整合街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，无需标签数据

Result: 在8个北美城市应用，方法能高保真度恢复属级多样性模式，获得低Wasserstein距离的Shannon和Simpson指数，保持空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够在缺乏详细数据的城市开展生物多样性制图，支持低成本直续监测和城市生态系统的遭退性管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通检测中跨域场景下存在许多挑战，需要解决不同域间的域差异问题。

Method: 提出自感适应对齐方法(SA3)，使用关注基准对齐模块进行图像级特征对齐，实现局部-全局适应对齐，并通过重新权重额道重要性来促进显著区域特征获取。

Result: 在流行跨域对象检测数据集上进行了大量实验，结果显示SA3方法超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SA3方法通过有效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功地解决了跨域对象检测的挑战，为智能交通检测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型虽然视觉效果优秀，但常常无法精确对齐文本提示，导致缺失关键元素或概念混淆

Method: 在去噪过程中显式建模信号组件，学习高成功率分布，支持边框等额外条件模态，无需训练且兼容扩散和流匹配架构

Result: 方法在实验中表现超过当前最优方法，能够生成更准确反映提示内容的图像

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需训练、高效的解决方案，能够显著提升文本到图像生成的准确性和可控性

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The
code is available at https://github.com/grimalPaul/gsn-factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于专家团队直接观察的石材劣化识别方法虽然准确，但耗时耗资源，需要开发更高效的自动化诊断系统。

Method: 采用基于认知架构的多智能体AI系统，协调5个专业AI代理（岩性学家、病理学家、环境专家、修复师和诊断协调员）协作进行石材病理诊断。

Result: 在28张包含多种劣化模式的困难图像测试中，系统所有指标相比基础模型都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 多智能体AI系统能够有效模拟专家协作，自动化石材病理诊断，在效率和准确性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: The Id-Pattern system within the RED.AI project (Reabilita\c{c}\~ao
Estrutural Digital atrav\'es da AI) consists of an agentic system designed to
assist in the identification of stone deterioration patterns. Traditional
methodologies, based on direct observation by expert teams, are accurate but
costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to
simulate collaboration between experts and automate the diagnosis of stone
pathologies from visual evidence. The approach is based on a cognitive
architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两个现实的增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)，替代传统的简化指标，并发现所有增量学习方法都表现差强，甚至不如重放少量旧数据的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习(IL)评估多使用简化的合成指标，影音了对现实场景性能的准确估计，需要更现实的评测基准来揭示真实性能。

Method: 构建了两个现实增量学习目标检测基准(RICO)：域RICO(D-RICO)包含域迁移但类别固定，扩展类RICO(EC-RICO)每步增加新域和新类。基于14个多样数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件(天气、时间)、摄像头和标注政策。

Result: 所有IL方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现差强。重放少量旧数据的方法已经超过所有IL方法，但仍不如对数据进行单独训练的效果。

Conclusion: 现有IL方法在现实场景下存在显著性能缺口，应归因于软化教学中的弱老师、单一模型无法处理多样任务以及可塑性不足。这为未来IL研究指明了改进方向。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新颖的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习更具临床意义的特征，提高在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义的特征，导致在分布偏移下泛化性能差。需要一种无需密集概念标注的方法来提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 使用小型辅助数据集合成高质量解耦概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的潜在概念表示，通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间内激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在受控数据集上显著提升对虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中，在合成扰动和OOD泛化下均表现优异。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可有效提升模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Motivation: 南亚霞霉事件对危机生态和经济造成重大影响，但缺乏区域性实时预测系统，需要发展有效的氟层氟洛指数预测方法

Method: 使用Sentinel-5P卫星数据(2019-2023)和卷积长短期记忆网络(ConvLSTM)，通过累积空间时间相关性预测紫外氟层氟洛指数

Result: 模型在五天预测间隔下，平均方差错误为~0.0018，损失为~0.3995，结构相似性指数为~0.74，显示了有效的预测能力

Conclusion: ConvLSTM模型能够有效预测南亚霞霉氟层氟洛指数，但通过整合更多数据和精炼模型架构，还可以进一步提高预测精度

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 所提出的SCRNet通过创新地结合卷积操作和交叉注意力机制，有效地解决了医学超声图像分割中的长程依赖和局部上下文关联问题，为该领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

TL;DR: DIME-Net是一个双光照增强框架，通过混合专家机制自适应处理低光和背光图像，在单一训练过程中实现多种光照条件下的鲁棒增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中复杂光照条件（如低光和背光）导致图像质量下降，现有方法大多只能处理单一类型的光照退化，缺乏统一处理多样化光照条件的能力。

Method: 提出混合专家光照估计模块，使用稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络；结合Retinex理论设计损伤修复模块，包含光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制；构建混合光照数据集MixBL进行训练。

Conclusion: DIME-Net框架能够有效处理多样化的复杂光照条件，在多媒体应用中具有实际应用潜力，通过单一训练过程实现了对低光和背光图像的统一增强。

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的人脸图像质量评估方法主要依赖卷积神经网络，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量标记与图像块标记拼接，通过全局自注意力处理，最后分为两个头：一个用于学习判别性人脸表示，另一个用于预测质量分数。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试和多个FR模型上的广泛实验表明，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的架构在建模人脸图像效用方面非常有效，ViT有潜力成为未来FIQA研究的可扩展基础。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长距离感知的计算效率问题，为高速公路自动驾驶提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single

designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能选择非关键帧来补充场景信息，显著提升了3D高斯涂射模型的完整性和质量，为在线3D场景重建提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment方法通过显式噪声对齐机制显著提升了数据投毒后门攻击的效果，为对比学习安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To

noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight

structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

### [160] [Scavenger: Better Space-Time Trade-Offs for Key-Value Separated LSM-trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13909)
*Jianshun Zhang,Fang Wang,Sheng Qiu,Yi Wang,Jiaxin Ou,Junxun Huang,Baoquan Li,Peng Fang,Dan Feng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Scavenger是一个针对KV分离LSM-tree的垃圾回收优化方案，通过I/O高效的垃圾回收和基于补偿大小的空间感知压缩策略，在性能和空间放大之间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV分离LSM-tree虽然解决了写放大问题，但带来了严重的空间放大问题，现有垃圾回收策略优化不足且未充分考虑工作负载特性，同时忽略了索引LSM-tree的空间放大影响。

Method: 提出I/O高效的垃圾回收方案降低I/O开销，并引入基于补偿大小的空间感知压缩策略来最小化索引LSM-tree的空间放大。

Result: 实验表明Scavenger显著提高了写入性能，相比其他KV分离LSM-tree（BlobDB、Titan、TerarkDB）实现了更低的空间放大。

Conclusion: Scavenger系统性地解决了KV分离LSM-tree的空间放大问题，在性能和空间效率方面取得了更好的权衡。

Abstract: Key-Value Stores (KVS) implemented with log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree)
have gained widespread acceptance in storage systems. Nonetheless, a
significant challenge arises in the form of high write amplification due to the
compaction process. While KV-separated LSM-trees successfully tackle this
issue, they also bring about substantial space amplification problems, a
concern that cannot be overlooked in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage
collection (GC) holds significant promise for space amplification reduction,
yet existing GC strategies often fall short in optimization performance,
lacking thorough consideration of workload characteristics. Additionally,
current KV-separated LSM-trees also ignore the adverse effect of the space
amplification in the index LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze
the sources of space amplification of KV-separated LSM-trees and introduce
Scavenger, which achieves a better trade-off between performance and space
amplification. Scavenger initially proposes an I/O-efficient garbage collection
scheme to reduce I/O overhead and incorporates a space-aware compaction
strategy based on compensated size to minimize the space amplification of index
LSM-trees. Extensive experiments show that Scavenger significantly improves
write performance and achieves lower space amplification than other
KV-separated LSM-trees (including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB).

TL;DR: Scavenger+是一个针对KV分离LSM-tree的优化系统，通过高效的垃圾回收、空间感知的压缩策略和动态调度器，显著降低了空间放大并提升了写入性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV分离的LSM-tree虽然解决了写入放大的问题，但带来了严重的空间放大问题，特别是在成本敏感的场景中。现有的垃圾回收策略效率低下，且没有考虑工作负载特性，同时忽略了索引LSM-tree造成的空间放大。

Method: 提出了Scavenger+系统，包含三个核心组件：(1) I/O高效的垃圾回收方案降低I/O开销；(2) 基于补偿大小的空间感知压缩策略缓解索引引起的空间放大；(3) 动态GC调度器根据系统负载自适应调整，优化CPU和存储资源利用。

Result: 大量实验表明，Scavenger+相比最先进的KV分离LSM-tree（包括BlobDB、Titan和TerarkDB）显著提升了写入性能并降低了空间放大。

Conclusion: Scavenger+系统在KV分离LSM-tree中实现了更好的性能-空间权衡，通过系统性的空间放大源分析和创新的优化策略，为存储系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Key-Value Stores (KVS) based on log-structured merge-trees (LSM-trees) are
widely used in storage systems but face significant challenges, such as high
write amplification caused by compaction. KV-separated LSM-trees address write
amplification but introduce significant space amplification, a critical concern
in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) can reduce space
amplification, but existing strategies are often inefficient and fail to
account for workload characteristics. Moreover, current key-value (KV)
separated LSM-trees overlook the space amplification caused by the index
LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space
amplification in KV-separated LSM-trees and propose Scavenger+, which achieves
a better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an
I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a
space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate
index-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts
to system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Scavenger+ significantly improves write
performance and reduces space amplification compared to state-of-the-art
KV-separated LSM-trees, including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB.

TL;DR: 这是一份关于日志使用的系统性调研报告，分析了数据库、数据仓库、网站和知识图谱日志的共同特征、标准处理流程以及约束条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字跟踪在各种资源中产生的日志具有重要价值，但相关研究分散且缺乏统一总结。需要系统性整理现有日志使用研究状况。

Method: 系统性调研分析了300多篇公开出版物，重点研究三个核心问题：日志结构功能特征、标准处理流程、约束条件和非功能需求。

Result: 发现少有完整的端到端方案，日志使用流程缺乏标准化，不同类型日志存在共享结构元素。

Conclusion: 本调研为研究人员和实践者提供了日志使用的全面概览，指出了未来研究方向，尤其是知识图谱日志的利用和普及化。

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log
usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly
regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MELISO+是一个全栈分布式内存计算框架，通过两层错误校正机制和分布式RRAM计算架构，解决了RRAM设备非理想性和大规模计算扩展性问题，显著提升了能效和计算精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构因数据移动能耗高而难以满足指数增长的计算需求，RRAM内存计算面临设备非理想性和大规模计算扩展性差的挑战。

Method: 提出两层错误校正机制来缓解设备非理想性，开发分布式RRAM计算框架支持超过65,000×65,000维度的矩阵计算。

Result: 设备非理想性导致的一阶和二阶算术误差减少90%以上，能效提升3-5个数量级，延迟降低100倍，低精度RRAM设备在精度、能耗和延迟指标上超越高精度替代方案。

Conclusion: MELISO+通过算法-硬件协同设计和可扩展架构，显著推进了适用于大语言模型和生成式AI等应用的可持续高维计算。

Abstract: Exponential growth in global computing demand is exacerbated due to the
higher-energy requirements of conventional architectures, primarily due to
energy-intensive data movement. In-memory computing with Resistive Random
Access Memory (RRAM) addresses this by co-integrating memory and processing,
but faces significant hurdles related to device-level non-idealities and poor
scalability for large computing tasks. Here, we introduce \textbf{MELISO+}
(In-\textbf{Me}mory \textbf{Li}near \textbf{So}lver), a full-stack, distributed
framework for energy-efficient in-memory computing. MELISO+ proposes a novel
two-tier error correction mechanism to mitigate device non-idealities and
develops a distributed RRAM computing framework to enable matrix computations
exceeding dimensions of $65,000 \times 65,000$. This approach reduces first-
and second-order arithmetic errors due to device non-idealities by over 90\%,
enhances energy efficiency by three to five orders of magnitude, and decreases
latency 100-fold. Hence, MELISO+ allows lower-precision RRAM devices to
outperform high-precision device alternatives in accuracy, energy and latency
metrics. By unifying algorithm-hardware co-design with scalable architecture,
MELISO+ significantly advances sustainable, high-dimensional computing suitable
for applications like large language models and generative AI.

Method: 使用Comb基准测试套件评估非阻塞、持久化和分区通信的性能，分析进程数、线程数和消息大小对分区通信的影响

Result: 持久化MPI通信相比基线提速37%，分区MPI通信提速68%，通信优化效果显著

Conclusion: MPI持久化和分区通信能有效提升迭代模板操作的性能，特别是在大规模并行计算中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Many parallel applications rely on iterative stencil operations, whose
performance are dominated by communication costs at large scales. Several MPI
optimizations, such as persistent and partitioned communication, reduce
overheads and improve communication efficiency through amortized setup costs
and reduced synchronization of threaded sends. This paper presents the
performance of stencil communication in the Comb benchmarking suite when using
non blocking, persistent, and partitioned communication routines. The impact of
each optimization is analyzed at various scales. Further, the paper presents an
analysis of the impact of process count, thread count, and message size on
partitioned communication routines. Measured timings show that persistent MPI
communication can provide a speedup of up to 37% over the baseline MPI
communication, and partitioned MPI communication can provide a speedup of up to
68%.

Conclusion: OrbitChain框架能够实现实时地球观测分析，支持时间敏感应用和星座间协作，为实时地球观测分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive
applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of
ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and
analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time
demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics,
we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates
computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation
constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices
and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic
routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication
overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth
observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and
inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain,
we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show
that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth
observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up
to 72%.

Conclusion: 通过充分利用异构计算资源，多CPU核心加速GPU通信是解决大规模all-reduce瓶颈的有效方法

Abstract: Large inter-GPU all-reduce operations, prevalent throughout deep learning,
are bottlenecked by communication costs. Emerging heterogeneous architectures
are comprised of complex nodes, often containing $4$ GPUs and dozens to
hundreds of CPU cores per node. Parallel applications are typically accelerated
on the available GPUs, using only a single CPU core per GPU while the remaining
cores sit idle. This paper presents novel optimizations to large GPU-aware
all-reduce operations, extending lane-aware reductions to the GPUs, and notably
using multiple CPU cores per GPU to accelerate these operations. These
multi-CPU-accelerated GPU-aware lane all-reduces yield speedup of up to $2.45$x
for large MPI all-reduces across the NVIDIA A100 GPUs of NCSA's Delta
supercomputer. Finally, the approach is extended to NVIDIA's and AMD's
collective communication libraries, achieving speedup of up to $1.77$x and
$1.71$x, respectively, across $2$ state-of-the-art supercomputers.

Abstract: The volume of scientific data produced for and by numerical simulation
workflows is increasing at an incredible rate. This raises concerns either in
computability, interpretability, and sustainability. This is especially
noticeable in earth science (geology, meteorology, oceanography, and
astronomy), notably with climate studies.
  We highlight five main evaluation issues: efficiency, discrepancy, diversity,
interpretability, availability.
  Among remedies, lossless and lossy compression techniques are becoming
popular to better manage dataset volumes. Performance assessment -- with
comparative benchmarks -- require open datasets shared under FAIR principles
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), with MRE (Minimal Reproducible
Example) ancillary data for reuse. We share LUNDIsim, an exemplary faulted
geological mesh. It is inspired by SPE10 comparative Challenge. Enhanced by
porosity/permeability datasets, this dataset proposes four distinct subsurface
environments. They were primarily designed for flow simulation in porous media.
Several consistent resolutions (with HexaShrink multiscale representations) are
proposed for each model. We also provide a set of reservoir features for
reproducing typical two-phase flow simulations on all LUNDIsim models in a
reservoir engineering context. This dataset is chiefly meant for benchmarking
and evaluating data size reduction (upscaling) or genuine composite mesh
compression algorithms. It is also suitable for other advanced mesh processing
workflows in geology and reservoir engineering, from visualization to machine
learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing
graph-structured data prevalent in various real-world applications. However,
the scalability of full-batch GNN training becomes severely limited by high
communication overhead and load imbalance in distributed environments. In this
paper, we present CaPGNN, a novel framework for efficient parallel full-batch
GNN training on single-server with multi-GPU, designed specifically to reduce
redundant inter-GPU communication and balance computational workloads. We
propose a joint adaptive caching algorithm that leverages both CPU and GPU
memory to significantly reduce the repetitive transmission of vertex features
across partitions. Additionally, we introduce a resource-aware graph
partitioning algorithm that adjusts subgraph sizes dynamically according to the
heterogeneous computational and communication capacities of GPUs. Extensive
experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that CaPGNN
effectively reduces communication costs by up to 96% and accelerates GNN
training by up to 12.7 times compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our
results highlight the potential of adaptive caching and resource-aware
partitioning to facilitate scalable, efficient, and practical deployment of
full-batch GNN training in distributed computing environments.

Abstract: The pace of RISC-V adoption continues to grow rapidly, yet for the successes
enjoyed in areas such as embedded computing, RISC-V is yet to gain ubiquity in
High Performance Computing (HPC). The Sophon SG2044 is SOPHGO's next generation
64-core high performance CPU that has been designed for workstation and server
grade workloads. Building upon the SG2042, subsystems that were a bottleneck in
the previous generation have been upgraded.
  In this paper we undertake the first performance study of the SG2044 for HPC.
Comparing against the SG2042 and other architectures, we find that the SG2044
is most advantageous when running at higher core counts, delivering up to 4.91
greater performance than the SG2042 over 64-cores. Two of the most important
upgrades in the SG2044 are support for RVV v1.0 and an enhanced memory
subsystem. This results in the SG2044 significantly closing the performance gap
with other architectures, especially for compute-bound workloads.

Method: 采用平衡的无线网络维度(RND)方法，结合实用的新无线电(NR)建模和数据驱动策略，通过numerology和带宽部分(BWPs)实现服务定制化的资源分配

Result: 提出了能够协调覆盖-容量权衡的5G网络规划基础方法，能够最小化部署成本并降低每比特成本

Conclusion: 该研究为5G网络规划提供了理论基础和方法框架，通过数据驱动和平衡维度的方法有效解决了5G部署中的关键挑战

Abstract: The fifth-generation (5G) of cellular communications is expected to be
deployed in the next years to support a wide range of services with different
demands of peak data rates, latency and quality of experience (QoE). To support
higher data rates and latency requirements third-generation partnership project
(3GPP) has introduced numerology and bandwidth parts (BWPs), via new radio (NR)
for service-tailored resource allocation. Legacy 4G networks have generated
extensive data, which combined with crowd-sourced LTE infrastructure insights,
enables identification of high-traffic 5G deployment area (5GDA) for planning
new services. Given the mission-critical nature of 5G services, QoE is a big
challenge for MNOs to guarantee peak data rates for a defined percentage of
time. This work studies the fundamentals of 5G network planning methods that
reconciles coverage-capacity trade-offs through balanced radio network
dimensioning (RND), leveraging pragmatic NR modeling, and data-driven
strategies to minimize deployment costs and reduce cost-per-bit.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的AMR算法都针对特定信道和系统设计，因为训练数据集维度固定，无法适应动态环境

Method: 将通信系统视为子图，利用样本间关系来平滑噪声和不同信道带来的影响，提取鲁棒特征

Result: 在5个公开真实数据集上验证，相比最先进算法提升20%宏平均识别精度和30%识别准确率

Conclusion: SEL-AMR是首个能够适应任意动态信道和系统的AMR算法，解决了现有方法固定维度限制的问题

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) detects
  modulation schemes of received signals for further processing
  of signals without any priori information, which is critically
  important for civil spectrum regulation, information countermea sures, and
communication security. Due to the powerful feature
  extraction and classification capabilities of Deep Learning (DL),
  DL-based AMR algorithms have achieved excellent performance
  gains compared with traditional modulation detection algorithms.
  However, all existing DL-based AMR algorithms, to the best of
  our knowledge, are designed for specific channels and systems,
  because data dimension of the used training dataset is fixed. To
  this end, we takes the first step to propose a Subgraph Embedding
  Learning (SEL) structure to address the classical AMR problem,
  and the proposed algorithm is called SEL-AMR. Our algorithm
  treats the communication system as a subgraph and uses the
  relationship between samples to smooth the effects brought by
  noise and different channels to extract robust features. Thus,
  the proposed SEL-AMR algorithm can adapt to any dynamic
  channels and systems. We use 5 public real datasets and a small
  amount of simulation data to evaluate our SEL-AMR algorithm.
  Experimental results reveal that SEL-AMR can well adapt to
  different channels and systems, and always outperforms the state of-the-art
algorithms by improving up to 20% macro-average
  recognition precision and 30% recognition accuracy.

*Xiyuan Liu,Guano Liu,Xiucheng Tian,Wenting Wei*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: CountingStars是一种低开销的网络测量架构，通过数字孪生系统和端口聚合数据结构解决LEO星座网络中包负载均衡带来的内存膨胀和哈希冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO巨型星座的高移动性导致网络拓扑高度动态变化，包负载均衡(PBLB)虽然能缓解服务中断问题，但带来了内存膨胀和严重哈希冲突两个关键挑战。

Method: 在地面控制器构建数字孪生系统预测未来网络拓扑，预先生成无冲突哈希种子；在卫星端采用端口聚合数据结构，通过高效位操作解耦流标识符和多端口计数器。

Result: 内存使用平均减少70%，测量相对误差平均降低90%，FPGA实现验证了实际部署可行性。

Conclusion: CountingStars有效解决了PBLB带来的测量挑战，为LEO星座网络提供了高效可靠的测量解决方案。

Abstract: The high mobility of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mega-constellations
induces a highly dynamic network topology, leading to many problems like
frequent service disruptions. To mitigate this, Packet-based Load Balancing
(PBLB) is employed. However, this paradigm shift introduces two critical
challenges for network measurement stemming from the requirement for port-level
granularity: memory inflation and severe hash collisions. To tackle these
challenges, we propose CountingStars, a low-overhead network-wide measurement
architecture. In the ground controller, CountingStars builds a digital twins
system to accurately predict the future network topology. This allows ground
controller to generate and distribute collision-free hash seeds to satellites
in advance. On the satellite, we introduce a port aggregation data structure
that decouples the unique flow identifier from its multi-port counter and
updates it through efficient bit operations, solving the memory inflation
caused by PBLB. Simulation results show that the memory usage of CountingStars
is reduced by 70\% on average, and the relative error of measurement is reduced
by 90\% on average. Implementation on FPGA shows its prospect to deploy in real
system.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在5G核心网络中通过虚拟化网络功能安装IDS-IPS来防范DoS/DDoS攻击的方法，评估了虚拟机和容器化实现的网络性能，证明该方案能满足5G应用的QoS要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络的服务化架构展现了安全漏洞，现有研究多集中于网络功能布置而忽视安全问题，需要专门研究如何保护5G核心网络系统充得DoS/DDoS攻击。

Method: 采用虚拟化网络功能技术，在5G独立组网架构中布置入侵检测和防范系统(IDS-IPS)。提供了虚拟机和容器化实现详细细节，并在TCP和UDP应用场景下评估网络性能，最后在软件化5G核心网络中应用虚拟机实现。

Result: 实验结果显示，软件化IDS-IPS能够满足5G应用的QoS要求，包括网络吞吐量、延迟和数据包丢失等指标，同时有效防范DoS和DDoS攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了通过虚拟化网络功能技术安装IDS-IPS可以在保持5G网络性能的同时有效防范网络攻击，为5G核心网络安全保护提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The service-based architecture of 5G network allows network operators to
place virtualized network functions on commodity hardware, unlike the
traditional vendor-specific hardware-based functionalities. However, it expands
the security vulnerabilities and threats to the 5G network. While there exist
several theoretical studies on network function placement and service routing,
a few focused on the security aspects of the 5G network systems.
  This paper focuses on safeguarding the 5G core network systems from DoS and
DDoS attacks by placing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS-IPS) as
virtualized network functions following the 5G standalone architecture. To
ensure the virtualized placement of IDS-IPS, first, we provide thorough virtual
machine (VM)-based and containerized implementation details and evaluate the
network performance with two scenarios, IDS and IPS, in the presence of TCP and
UDP applications. Second, we apply the VM-based implementation of IDS-IPS on a
softwarized 5G core network and study the network performances. The experiment
results on network throughput, latency, and packet drop reveal that the
softwarized IDS-IPS can meet the QoS requirements of 5G applications, while
safeguarding the network from DoS and DDoS attacks.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 为解决Linux汽车控制单元中混合关键性应用的网络干扰问题，提出了一种分层软件架构，通过中间件层、网络栈层和硬件层的优先级策略实现时间隔离，确保实时流量的可预测延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车行业向基于Linux的中央化架构迁移时，混合关键性应用的可预测执行致关重要。但Linux网络栈的并发使用引入干扰，导致不可预测的延迟和振荡。

Method: 提出三层隔离架构：1)中间件层采用固定优先级非预占调度器管理发布者；2)网络层利用XDP技术将高优先级数据直接从网卡驱动路由到关键应用内存，翻越Linux栈；3)硬件层专门为实时流量分配网卡队列。基于DDS系统进行实现和验证。

Result: 评估结果显示，该方法能够在受到最佳努力应用严重干扰的情况下，为实时流量提供一致且可预测的延迟性能。

Conclusion: 该分层软件架构通过全栈隔离策略有效解决了Linux平台上混合关键性应用的网络干扰问题，为汽车行业向中央化Linux架构迁移提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: As the automotive industry transitions toward centralized Linux-based
architectures, ensuring the predictable execution of mixed-criticality
applications becomes essential. However, concurrent use of the Linux network
stack introduces interference, resulting in unpredictable latency and jitter.
To address this challenge, we present a layered software architecture that
enforces timing isolation for Ethernet-based data exchange between
mixed-criticality applications on Linux-based automotive control units. Our
approach integrates traffic prioritization strategies at the middleware layer,
the network stack layer, and the hardware layer to achieve isolation across the
full software stack. At the middleware layer, we implement a fixed-priority,
non-preemptive scheduler to manage publishers of varying criticality. At the
network layer, we leverage the express data path (XDP) to route high-priority
data directly from the network interface driver into critical application
memory, bypassing the standard Linux network stack. At the hardware layer, we
dedicate a network interface card (NIC) queue exclusively to real-time traffic.
We demonstrate how our architecture performs in a Data Distribution Service
(DDS)-based system. Our evaluation shows that the approach leads to consistent
and predictable latencies for real-time traffic, even under heavy interference
from best-effort applications.

used in offering sensing as a service. Protocol stack adaptations for both
control and a newly proposed sensing plane are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户界面描述语言(UIDL)广泛用于安全关键GUI开发，但缺乏形式化和验证方法，需要基础语义模型来支持可靠编译

Method: 为核心反应式UIDL语言Smalite建立指称语义模型，该语言足够表达实际语言的构造

Result: 提出了Smalite的语义模型，为形式验证和编译器验证奠定基础

Conclusion: 这项预研工作为形式验证的UIDL编译器提供了基础，有助于提高安全关键GUI应用的可靠性

Abstract: User Interface Description Languages (UIDLs) are high-level languages that
facilitate the development of Human-Machine Interfaces, such as Graphical User
Interface (GUI) applications. They usually provide first-class primitives to
specify how the program reacts to an external event (user input, network
message), and how data flows through the program. Although these
domain-specific languages are now widely used to implement safety-critical
GUIs, little work has been invested in their formalization and verification.
  In this paper, we propose a denotational semantic model for a core reactive
UIDL, Smalite, which we argue is expressive enough to encode constructs from
more realistic languages. This preliminary work may be used as a stepping stone
to produce a formally verified compiler for UIDLs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Larsen参数化双模似性的自然弱化版本：无限制结合交互双模似性，证明它在一般情况下是更粗糕的等价关系，但在确定性环境下与参数化双模似性一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从Larsen的参数化双模似性出发，探索其自然弱化版本，即无限制结合交互双模似性，以更好地理解进程在环境中的行为等价性。

Method: 通过定义结合交互进程p & e和q & e，并对比它们的双模似性。采用模态逻辑特征化方法，并将概念扩展到模拟预序关系。

Result: 结合交互参数化双模似性在确定性环境下与参数化双模似性一致，但在一般情况下是更粗糕的等价关系。在模拟预序关系上两种方法完全一致。

Conclusion: 结合交互参数化双模似性是参数化双模似性的有效弱化，通过环境确定化可以恢复原始概念。该研究为进程等价性提供了新的理论框架和分析工具。

Abstract: Departing from Larsen's concept of parameterized bisimilarity of processes
with respect to interaction with environments, we start an exploration of its
natural weakening: bisimilarity of unrestricted join interactions with
environments. Parameterized bisimilarity relates processes p and q with respect
to an environment e if p and q behave bi-similarly while joining --
respectively the same -- transitions from e. The weakened variant relates
processes p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction
processes p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar. (Hereby join
interactions r & f facilitate a step with label a to r' & f' if and only if r
and f permit a-steps to r' and f' , respectively.) Join-interaction
parameterized (ji-parameterized) bisimilarity coincides with parameterized
bisimilarity for deterministic environments, but that it is a coarser
equivalence in general. We explain how Larsen's concept can be recovered from
ji-parameterized bisimilarity by 'determinizing' interactions. We show that by
adaptation to simulatability (simulation preorder) the same concept arises:
parameterized simulatability coincides with ji-parameterized simulatability.
For the discrimination preorder of (ji-)parameterized simulatability on
environments we obtain the same result as Larsen did for parameterized
bisimilarity. Also, we give a modal-logic characterization of
(ji-)parameterized simulatability. Finally we gather open problems, and provide
an outlook on our current related work.

Motivation: 汽车行业产生大量的传感器、远程测量和实时运营数据，面临延迟、扩展性和一致性等挑战。现代数据湖仓格式能够结合数据湖和数据仓库的优势，支持复杂的应用场景。

Method: 使用真实世界的时间序列汽车远程测量数据（包含车辆ID、时间戳、位置、事件指标等字段），对Delta Parquet、Iceberg和Hudi进行模型策略、分区、CDC支持、查询性能、扩展性、数据一致性和生态系统成熟度等多方面的评估。

Conclusion: 研究为选择或组合不同格式提供了见解，以支持车队管理、预测性维护和路线优化等应用。结果为扩展数据管道和集成机器学习模型到汽车应用中提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The automotive industry generates vast amounts of data from sensors,
telemetry, diagnostics, and real-time operations. Efficient data engineering is
critical to handle challenges of latency, scalability, and consistency. Modern
data lakehouse formats Delta Parquet, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Hudi offer
features such as ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and real-time
ingestion, combining the strengths of data lakes and warehouses to support
complex use cases. This study presents a comparative analysis of Delta Parquet,
Iceberg, and Hudi using real-world time-series automotive telemetry data with
fields such as vehicle ID, timestamp, location, and event metrics. The
evaluation considers modeling strategies, partitioning, CDC support, query
performance, scalability, data consistency, and ecosystem maturity. Key
findings show Delta Parquet provides strong ML readiness and governance,
Iceberg delivers high performance for batch analytics and cloud-native
workloads, while Hudi is optimized for real-time ingestion and incremental
processing. Each format exhibits tradeoffs in query efficiency, time-travel,
and update semantics. The study offers insights for selecting or combining
formats to support fleet management, predictive maintenance, and route
optimization. Using structured datasets and realistic queries, the results
provide practical guidance for scaling data pipelines and integrating machine

*Dangfeng Pan,Zhensu Sun,Cenyuan Zhang,David Lo,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验研究证明代码格式化元素（缩进、换行等）对LLM性能影响微小，移除这些元素可节省24.5%输入token，而不影响代码生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码格式化元素主要用于提高人类可读性，但对LLM处理可能造成token浪费和计算成本增加，需要验证这些元素是否必需

Method: 在4种编程语言（Java、Python、C++、C#）和10个LLM上进行大规模实验，通过Fill-in-the-Middle代码补全任务系统分析格式化代码和非格式化代码的token数量和性能差异

Result: 移除格式化元素平均节省24.5%输入token，输出token减少微小，LLM性能基本保持不变；通过提示和微调还可进一步节省输出代码长度达36.1%

Conclusion: 移除代码格式化元素是一种实用的LLM效率优化策略，研究还开发了双向代码转换工具，既保证了LLM效率又维持了人类可读性

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个多维代码生成评估框架，不仅评估功能正确性，还评估算法效率和代码质量，发现当前模型在高效算法和可维护代码方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成基准主要关注功能正确性，忽略了真实编程中算法效率和代码质量这两个关键方面，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 使用50个真实Codility竞赛编程问题，收集393,150份人类提交作为基线，使用行业标准分析工具系统评估运行时效率和代码质量。

Result: 对三个领先推理增强模型（Claude Opus 4、Gemini 2.5 Pro、O4-Mini-High）的评估显示，高正确性得分的模型不一定能产生高效算法或可维护代码。

Conclusion: 仅评估正确性不足以真正理解代码生成模型的真实能力，需要多维评估来推动AI系统向健壮、可靠、生产就绪的方向发展。

Abstract: Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness
while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic
efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional
Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses
code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality.
COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility
competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions.
Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions
identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS
systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using
industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading
reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and
OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do
not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These
findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to
truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS
serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI
systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

Result: Maven Central呈现高度互联的无标度小世界拓扑结构，由少数基础设施中心节点支撑大部分项目，这些中心主要是测试框架和通用工具库

Conclusion: 中心节点带来效率优势但也造成系统风险，关键节点的故障或漏洞可能导致全局性的潜在影响

Abstract: Understanding the structural characteristics and connectivity patterns of
large-scale software ecosystems is critical for enhancing software reuse,
improving ecosystem resilience, and mitigating security risks. In this paper,
we investigate the Maven Central ecosystem, one of the largest repositories of
Java libraries, by applying network science techniques to its dependency graph.
Leveraging the Goblin framework, we extracted a sample consisting of the top
5,000 highly connected artifacts based on their degree centrality and then
performed breadth-first search (BFS) expansion from each selected artifact as a
seed node, traversing the graph outward to capture all libraries and releases
reachable those seed nodes. This sampling strategy captured the immediate
structural context surrounding these libraries resulted in a curated graph
comprising of 1.3 million nodes and 20.9 million edges. We conducted a
comprehensive analysis of this graph, computing degree distributions,
betweenness centrality, PageRank centrality, and connected components
graph-theoretic metrics. Our results reveal that Maven Central exhibits a
highly interconnected, scale-free, and small-world topology, characterized by a
small number of infrastructural hubs that support the majority of projects.
Further analysis using PageRank and betweenness centrality shows that these
hubs predominantly consist of core ecosystem infrastructure, including testing
frameworks and general-purpose utility libraries. While these hubs facilitate
efficient software reuse and integration, they also pose systemic risks;
failures or vulnerabilities affecting these critical nodes can have widespread
and cascading impacts throughout the ecosystem.

Motivation: 现有分析方法在估计多核架构缓存争用时过度估计远程块访问导致的缓存缺失，没有考虑实际缓存状态和访问数量

Method: 基于任务中程序区域的顺序识别可能受远程访问影响的内存引用，构建细粒度争用分析，通过动态规划计算缓存缺失数量

Result: 相比现有方法，提出的分析将核间缓存干扰平均减少52.31%，WCET估计平均减少8.94%，计算开销没有显著增加

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提高多核架构WCET分析的准确性，通过考虑实际缓存状态和访问数量来减少过度估计

Abstract: WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is
particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared
by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between
parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program
regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by
a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number
of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention.
Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory
references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region.
Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the
number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks.
We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be
obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing
methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET
estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing
computation overhead.

Result: 模型在人工数据和宏观经济数据实验中表现出良好性能，适用于预测和结构经济分析

Conclusion: 该模型为高维非线性时间序列分析提供了有效的框架，兼具理论优势和计算可行性

Abstract: This paper proposes a Vector Autoregression augmented with nonlinear factors
that are modeled nonparametrically using regression trees. There are four main
advantages of our model. First, modeling potential nonlinearities
nonparametrically lessens the risk of mis-specification. Second, the use of
factor methods ensures that departures from linearity are modeled
parsimoniously. In particular, they exhibit functional pooling where a small
number of nonlinear factors are used to model common nonlinearities across
variables. Third, Bayesian computation using MCMC is straightforward even in
very high dimensional models, allowing for efficient, equation by equation
estimation, thus avoiding computational bottlenecks that arise in popular
alternatives such as the time varying parameter VAR. Fourth, existing methods
for identifying structural economic shocks in linear factor models can be
adapted for the nonlinear case in a straightforward fashion using our model.
Exercises involving artificial and macroeconomic data illustrate the properties
of our model and its usefulness for forecasting and structural economic
analysis.

Method: 使用范畴论概念（对象、态射、学习/遗忘函子、极限和余极限）构建模型，并应用于2018-2023年的实证数据

Result: 发现均衡汇率与观察汇率之间存在显著结构性错配，提出了衡量贬值风险的新聚合指标

Conclusion: 该框架与现代计算工具（如机器学习）具有强协同效应，为复杂经济体的政策分析和预测提供了更稳健的方法

Abstract: Traditional macroeconomic models, based on static algebraic systems, fail to
capture the dynamics of a bimonetary economy like Argentina's. This paper
proposes a framework based on category theory to develop a more flexible and
structured model that represents the evolving relationships between key
variables such as inflation expectations, interest rates, and currency demand.
Using concepts like objects, morphisms, learning/forgetful functors, limits,
and colimits, the model is applied to empirical data from 2018-2023. The
findings reveal a significant structural misalignment between the equilibrium
and observed exchange rates and propose a new aggregate indicator to measure
devaluation risk. The framework demonstrates a strong synergy with modern
computational tools like machine learning, offering a more robust approach to
policy analysis and forecasting in complex economies.

Motivation: 为了提供一种新的工具来预测金融市场对中央银行治策治通信的反应，捕捉传统测量方法无法涉及的解释性不确定性。

Method: 构建了30个具有不同风险偏好、认知偏见和解释风格的合成交易员模型，采用三种提示策略（简单、少量示例、LLM作为判断框架）来预测欧元利率交换水平。

Result: 即使是简单提示方法也能产生与实际市场结果强相关性（约0.5），尤其在长期分析中表现突出。LLM作为判断框架在第一次迭代中进一步提高了准确性。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的模拟能够有效捕捉金融市场的解释性不确定性，为中央银行提供了预测市场反应、精炼治策沟通策略和提升金融稳定性的实用工具。

Abstract: This paper develops a novel method to simulate financial market reactions to
European Central Bank (ECB) press conferences using a Large Language Model
(LLM). We create a behavioral, agent-based simulation of 30 synthetic traders,
each with distinct risk preferences, cognitive biases, and interpretive styles.
These agents forecast Euro interest rate swap levels at 3-month, 2-year, and
10-year maturities, with the variation across forecasts serving as a measure of
market uncertainty or disagreement. We evaluate three prompting strategies,
naive, few-shot (enriched with historical data), and an advanced iterative
'LLM-as-a-Judge' framework, to assess the effect of prompt design on predictive
performance. Even the naive approach generates a strong correlation (roughly
0.5) between synthetic disagreement and actual market outcomes, particularly
for longer-term maturities. The LLM-as-a-Judge framework further improves
accuracy at the first iteration. These results demonstrate that LLM-driven
simulations can capture interpretive uncertainty beyond traditional measures,
providing central banks with a practical tool to anticipate market reactions,
refine communication strategies, and enhance financial stability.

### [190] [Pricing insurance policies with offsetting relationship](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13409)
*Hamza Hanbali*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在保险业务线中采用多元化定价的优势，证明联合定价在相同风险降低情况下更具竞争力，但会限制批准灵活性，并通过已西市场数据验证了论断条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在保险政策定价中考虑业务线间多元化效应的价值，以获得竞争优势并优化定价策略。

Method: 建立了保费与客户数量关系的明确模型，以总收入为准则比较单独定价与联合定价策略，并统计分析已西市场数据。

Result: 联合定价能够提升竞争力，但受到批准灵活性的限制；已西市场数据显示大多数业务线组合满足联合定价条件，即使在高相关性下也如此。

Conclusion: 多元化定价策略为保险公司提供了重要的竞争优势，但需结合客户对价格折扣的敏感度进行优化决策。

Abstract: This paper investigates the benefits of incorporating diversification effects
into the pricing process of insurance policies from two different business
lines. The paper shows that, for the same risk reduction, insurers pricing
policies jointly can have a competitive advantage over those pricing them
separately. However, the choice of competitiveness constrains the underwriting
flexibility of joint pricers. The paper goes a step further by modeling
explicitly the relationship between premiums and the number of customers in
each line. Using the total collected premiums as a criterion to compare the
competing strategies, the paper provides conditions for the optimal pricing
decision based on policyholders' sensitivity to price discounts. The results
are illustrated for a portfolio of annuities and assurances. Further, using
non-life data from the Brazilian insurance market, an empirical exploration
shows that most pairs satisfy the condition for being priced jointly, even when
pairwise correlations are high.

Result: 提案模型达到92%的性能指标（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2），敏感度比基准模型提高10%，不确定性指标熬的计量减少0.2。

Conclusion: 通过学习医生的背景知识，可以有效降低医疗AI的诊断不确定性，提高诊断准确性和可靠性，为医疗AI的临床应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

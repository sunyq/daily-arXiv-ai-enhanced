### [1] [SynLang and Symbiotic Epistemology: A Manifesto for Conscious Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21067)
*Jan Kapusta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Symbiotic Epistemology的哲学框架，将AI定位为推理伙伴，通过SynLang协议实现透明协作，提升人类智能并保持伦理责任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明性阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 提出Symbiotic Epistemology哲学框架，引入SynLang协议（包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制），结合信心量化和上下文继承。

Result: 通过实际人机对话验证了AI对结构化推理协议的适应能力及元认知干预的成功。

Conclusion: SynLang协议通过双重透明性支持快速理解和验证AI决策，增强人类智能并保持伦理责任。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

### [3] [Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Synthea Module Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21123)
*Mark A. Kramer,Aanchal Mathur,Caroline E. Adams,Jason A. Walonoski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）辅助开发Synthea（开源合成健康数据生成器）的新疾病模块，以减少开发时间、降低专业需求、增加模型多样性并提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过LLMs辅助开发Synthea模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛并优化合成数据质量。

Method: 提出四种LLMs支持模块开发的方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块及优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLMs在模块开发中展现出潜力，但也存在需人工监督、严格测试及内容准确性等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究以充分发挥LLMs在合成数据生成中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

### [4] [Efficacy of AI RAG Tools for Complex Information Extraction and Data Annotation Tasks: A Case Study Using Banks Public Disclosures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21360)
*Nicholas Botti,Flora Haberkorn,Charlotte Hoopes,Shaun Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过随机任务分配实验，比较了AI检索增强生成（RAG）工具在信息提取和数据标注任务中的效果，发现交互式使用AI工具显著提升速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI工具（特别是RAG）在复杂信息提取和标注任务中的实际效果，以及不同使用方式（如交互式与非交互式）对任务执行的影响。

Method: 采用被试内设计，随机分配任务，比较了两种AI使用条件（“简单”和“交互式”）与纯人工基线的表现，任务基于真实银行披露文档。

Result: AI工具（尤其是交互式使用）将任务速度提升至10倍，并提高准确性，预计可节省268小时；标注者的AI工具技能也影响表现。

Conclusion: 交互式AI工具能显著提升复杂标注任务的效率和准确性，标注者的AI技能是关键因素。

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

### [5] [Measuring and Analyzing Intelligence via Contextual Uncertainty in Large Language Models using Information-Theoretic Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21129)
*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种任务无关的方法，通过“认知轮廓”和“熵衰减曲线”分析LLMs的内部信息处理机制，揭示了模型规模和文本复杂度对其动态的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs的内部工作机制，超越传统的任务性能指标，探索模型如何处理信息。

Method: 引入任务无关的“认知轮廓”方法，基于熵衰减曲线和IGS指数定量分析模型的信息处理动态。

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知轮廓，受模型规模和文本复杂度影响。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的原则性方法，用于分析和比较AI的内在操作动态。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

### [6] [Reasoning Language Models for Root Cause Analysis in 5G Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21974)
*Mohamed Sana,Nicola Piovesan,Antonio De Domenico,Yibin Kang,Haozhe Zhang,Merouane Debbah,Fadhel Ayed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行移动网络中的根因分析（RCA），并通过两阶段训练方法提升模型的准确性和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络中的根因分析需要可解释性、领域专业知识和因果推理，现有开源推理LLMs在此任务上表现不佳，因此需要领域特定适配。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法，结合监督微调和强化学习，并引入TeleLogs数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个LLM规模上显著优于现有推理和非推理模型，并能泛化到随机测试变体。

Conclusion: 领域适配和推理增强的LLMs在网络运维中具有实际和可解释的RCA潜力。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

### [8] [NPO: Learning Alignment and Meta-Alignment through Structured Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21131)
*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO是一个对齐感知的学习框架，通过结构化反馈实现人类参与的决策系统的适应性调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将对齐视为静态或事后属性，NPO旨在通过可测量、可监督和可减少的对齐损失来解决这一问题。

Method: NPO提出了一种对齐损失的形式化定义，并引入了元对齐作为监控过程的保真度，通过阈值保真度将其简化为主要对齐。

Result: 在随机反馈下，NPO证明了对齐损失和监控保真度能够收敛，并在大规模部署中表现出实际价值。

Conclusion: NPO提供了一个紧凑且可检查的架构，用于持续对齐监控，将理论对齐保证与实际动态环境中的可靠性联系起来。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

### [9] [LeMix: Unified Scheduling for LLM Training and Inference on Multi-GPU Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21276)
*Yufei Li,Zexin Li,Yinglun Zhu,Cong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeMix系统通过联合调度LLM的推理和训练任务，显著提升资源利用率和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间SLO达标率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

### [10] [Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132)
*Joshua Adrian Cahyono,Saran Subramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在高风险生活建议中的问题，发现其存在谄媚和过度自信的风险，并通过实验验证了模型的稳健性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险建议中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，亟需研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三个实验：多选评估、自由回答分析和机制解释性实验，研究模型的稳健性和可控性。

Result: 部分模型表现稳健，如o4-mini；高性能模型通过提问而非直接建议提高安全性；激活向量可控制模型谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需多维度基准测试以确保LLMs在高风险决策中的可信度，激活向量调控为安全对齐提供新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

### [11] [Project Patti: Why can You Solve Diabolical Puzzles on one Sudoku Website but not Easy Puzzles on another Sudoku Website?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21137)
*Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新指标来量化数独难度，基于SAT问题和模拟人类解法，构建了一个通用难度评级系统，并与五个网站的难度标签进行了对比验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同数独网站对难度评级的定义，提出通用标准以实现跨网站一致性。

Method: 1. 将数独转化为SAT问题，提取结构复杂度指标；2. 模拟人类解法，统计策略使用次数。

Result: 两种指标与4/5网站的难度标签强相关，构建的通用评级系统能有效分类数独难度。

Conclusion: 提出的指标和评级系统能跨网站统一难度分类，并提供了初学者解法算法。

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

*McNair Shah,Saleena Angeline,Adhitya Rajendra Kumar,Naitik Chheda,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien,Will Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多维框架，通过线性探针探测和引导大语言模型中的有害内容，发现有害子空间低秩，主导方向引导可显著减少有害性且保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解并可靠地抑制大语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 为55种有害子概念学习线性探针，构建有害子空间，测试子空间消融和主导方向引导。

Result: 主导方向引导可几乎消除有害性，同时实用性降低较小。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为LLM行为提供了可扩展的视角，并为社区提供了审计和强化未来语言模型的实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

### [13] [Adaptive XAI in High Stakes Environments: Modeling Swift Trust with Multimodal Feedback in Human AI Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21158)
*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以提升高风险环境中人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险场景（如应急响应）中，现有XAI方法提供的统一解释和显式反馈机制不实用，需非侵入式自适应解释以增强信任。

Method: 利用EEG、ECG和眼动追踪等生理行为信号，构建多目标个性化信任估计模型，动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF框架为高风险、时间敏感环境中开发自适应XAI系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 自适应XAI框架通过非侵入式反馈提升人机协作的快速信任，适用于高压环境。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

### [14] [Adaptive Cluster Collaborativeness Boosts LLMs Medical Decision Support Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21159)
*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs协作缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且部分LLMs在医疗决策支持中表现不佳，需改进协作效果。

Method: 采用自多样性和跨一致性机制：计算LLM内部输出的模糊匹配值作为自多样性值，优先选择高自多样性值的LLMs；测量跨一致性值并逐步剔除低一致性LLM以减少不一致输出。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上验证了方法的有效性，例如在NEJMQA的妇产科领域达到65.47%的准确率，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作效果，尤其在专科领域表现突出。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化建模与优化方法，用于解决主动配电网（ADN）调度问题，通过多LLM协作架构和用户友好的自然语言接口，降低了技术门槛并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源在主动配电网中的渗透率增加，缺乏专业知识的ADN运营商依赖人工专家成本高且耗时。本文旨在通过LLM技术实现智能、灵活的ADN调度。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计多LLM协作架构（信息提取器、问题建模器和代码编程器），并针对每个LLM代理开发定制优化技术。

Result: 通过多种测试案例的全面比较和端到端演示，验证了所提架构和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自然语言接口简化了ADN调度，显著降低了技术壁垒并提升了效率。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种基于LLM的方法，用于自动分类GitHub README文件的不同部分，性能优于现有方法，F1分数达0.98。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub README文件的完整性影响项目的采用和利用，但许多仓库所有者忽视这一点。研究旨在通过自动化工具提升README文件的质量。

Method: 使用BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa三种预训练模型，基于4226个README文件部分的数据集进行微调，并探索了参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）。

Result: 方法在分类任务中表现优异，F1分数达0.98，且参数高效微调技术在不显著降低性能的情况下提供了经济替代方案。

Conclusion: LLM在自动分类GitHub README文件内容方面具有潜力，有助于提升仓库的识别度和使用价值。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Motivation: 医学LLM存在偏见和不公平问题，需在临床应用前识别并缓解这些偏见。

Method: 结合知识图谱和辅助LLM，采用对抗扰动技术和多跳表征方法。

Result: 在三个数据集、六个LLM和五种偏见类型上的实验表明，该框架比其他基线更能揭示复杂偏见模式。

Conclusion: 该框架在识别医学LLM偏见方面具有更强的能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Conclusion: Agentic Web的发展需要开放、安全和智能的生态系统，结合人类意图和代理自主行为，未来研究应关注相关技术和治理方向。

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously
updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在解释复杂问题并将其映射为SPARQL查询时的组合能力，发现其表现随问题复杂性增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在语言解释过程中是否具有系统性组合能力，即能否从已知的原子部分推断复杂结构的含义。

Method: 通过生成基于DBpedia图模式的三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，测试LLMs在提示优化、少样本学习和微调下的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着问题偏离优化样本的程度增加，模型的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，即使输入包含所有必要信息，最高F1分数仅为0.57。

Conclusion: LLMs在系统性和组合性解释问题并将其映射为SPARQL查询方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Motivation: 当前LLM在编码辅助中因开发者提示模糊而生成错误代码，需改进以更准确理解用户意图。

Method: 系统包括查询分类器和微调LLM，前者检测模糊查询，后者生成澄清问题。

Result: 微调LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究显示其问题更有效。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过生成澄清问题显著提升了代码响应的准确性和帮助性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Motivation: 解决RALM在文档相关性评估和知识整合中的事实错误问题，提升其鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 采用多维评分系统，结合语义匹配和来源可靠性，使用嵌入相关性评分和混合质量合成训练数据。

Result: 初步评估显示幻觉率显著降低，推理过程透明度提高。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更可靠的问答系统迈出了重要一步，但仍需解决信息可信度区分和系统延迟平衡的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Result: 实验模拟（Stupid game场景）显示，基于TA的智能体能够产生更深入且情境感知的交互。

Conclusion: Trans-ACT为冲突解决、教育支持和高级社会心理学研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

Motivation: 供应链管理面临需求波动、库存失衡和牛鞭效应等挑战，传统方法难以应对动态市场条件，而现有机器学习技术存在计算复杂性和训练效率问题。LNN因其适应性和低计算成本成为潜在解决方案，但其在供应链优化中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究提出了一种混合LNN和XGBoost的模型，利用LNN的动态特征提取能力和XGBoost的全局优化能力，优化多级供应链的订单策略。

Result: 该模型旨在缓解牛鞭效应并提高累积利润，同时满足供应链管理中对适应性和效率的双重需求。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了现有方法的空白，为动态高效的供应链管理提供了一种创新解决方案。

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了生成部分指定任务的框架，采用强化微调策略奖励模型提出能获取隐含信息的问题。

Result: 实验显示，Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估中优于o3-mini 18%，人类评估中其提问和最终方案分别被偏好42%和28%。

Conclusion: 主动澄清问题能显著提升LLMs的协作能力，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型的输出至关重要。现有方法（如语义熵）依赖阈值来衡量语义等价关系，但缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的不确定性度量框架，通过捕捉语义关系的连续性，并验证其满足三个基本性质。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性比基线方法更准确地预测模型在问答及其他数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性提供了一种更精细的度量方法，优于现有的基于阈值的方法。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model

enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动维护本体和知识图谱耗时费力，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽拥有丰富知识但难以保持结构化一致性，因此需要一种结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 提出Evo-DKD框架，通过双解码器（一个生成本体编辑，一个生成自然语言解释）和动态注意力门控机制协调结构化与非结构化知识。由于GPU限制，采用基于提示的单流模式模拟双解码行为。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式，结合符号和神经推理的优势，实现可持续的本体演化。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中的性能，验证其生成上下文相关响应的能力，并比较其与其他模型的优劣。

Method: 分两阶段评估：第一阶段仅嵌入CPIC数据，第二阶段加入PharmGKB内容。通过Likert量表和召回率评分，并与ChatGPT-4omini对比。

Result: Sherpa Rx在准确性（4.9）、相关性（5.0）、清晰度（5.0）和完整性（4.8）方面表现优异，显著优于ChatGPT-4omini。

Conclusion: 整合CPIC和PharmGKB数据可提升AI性能，Sherpa Rx在药物基因组学中具有变革潜力，能提供准确、个性化的决策支持。

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

*Zujie Xie,Zixuan Chen,Jiheng Liang,Xiangyang Yu,Ziru Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的端到端框架，用于低数据条件下红外光谱的自动化分析，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对，而LLM的泛化和推理能力为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 结合文献知识库、光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，通过闭环多轮协议动态优化预测。

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM的性能优于单轮推理，且与机器学习和深度学习模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人类与AI系统的协作需求增加，开发能准确模拟个体决策的AI变得重要。现有方法需要大量个体数据，不适用于新用户或数据稀疏用户。

Method: Maia4All采用两阶段优化：1) 通过原型丰富模型桥接群体与个体行为建模；2) 利用能力水平或用户原型初始化并优化个体嵌入。

Result: Maia4All仅需20局棋局即可高精度预测个体行为和模式，显著优于之前需5000局的方法。

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模树立新标准，其原型丰富模型方法可扩展至其他领域，如个性化LLMs。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）简化供应链管理中的决策过程，减少对数据科学团队的依赖，并加速决策速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理中的决策工具虽然优化了决策，但理解和调整这些工具的输出仍需大量时间和专家介入，限制了效率。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）来自动解释工具结果、分析场景和更新数学模型，减少人工干预。

Result: 通过LLMs，决策时间从几天或几周缩短至几分钟或几小时，显著提升了管理者的效率和影响力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够民主化供应链技术，使其更易理解和使用，从而大幅提升决策效率和生产力。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在面对不可回答问题时产生不可信内容的问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了包含12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，并对28种MLLMs进行了诚实性评估。

Result: 大多数模型无法适当拒绝回答，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响。

Conclusion: 提出了基于监督和偏好学习的对齐方法，为未来可信MLLMs研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Result: 提出了一个定义“世界模型”的标准，特别关注表示世界的潜在状态空间。

Conclusion: 该定义为进一步研究奠定了基础，未来将扩展到动作效果建模。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

TL;DR: ST-GDance是一个新颖的框架，通过解耦空间和时间依赖关系，优化长期且无碰撞的群舞生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群舞生成需要同步多个舞者并保持空间协调，现有方法难以建模密集的时空交互，导致可扩展性问题和碰撞。

Method: 使用轻量级图卷积进行距离感知的空间建模，加速稀疏注意力进行高效时间建模。

Result: 在AIOZ-GDance数据集上，ST-GDance优于现有方法，尤其在生成长且连贯的群舞序列方面。

Conclusion: ST-GDance显著降低了计算成本，同时确保平滑且无碰撞的交互。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional

including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and
self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Result: 发现贝叶斯推理未成为现代具身智能的核心，且当前系统局限于封闭环境。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法有望推动具身智能向开放物理世界扩展。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出了SASA技术，通过将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层来增强安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，且对模型实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: SASA是一种无需微调的有效方法，能够显著增强LVLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习基准（如游戏）难以直接应用于现实世界的机器人交互场景，需要多样化的基准以应对复杂交互。

Method: 使用JAX硬件加速进行物理模拟，通过多智能体强化学习训练多样化的伙伴智能体，测试机器人零样本协调能力。

Result: Assistax在向量化训练时比CPU方案快370倍，并提供了可靠的基线结果。

Conclusion: Assistax是一个实用的基准测试，有助于推动辅助机器人领域的强化学习研究。

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BellNet的新方法，通过将策略迭代展开和截断为可学习的参数模型，以减少计算成本并有效逼近最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划方法在大状态-动作空间或长期依赖问题中计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，通过最小化Bellman误差训练，并利用图信号处理重新参数化。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以较少迭代有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种高效、可转移的动态规划方法，适用于复杂问题。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Conclusion: GDAIP在跨数据集场景下有效实现个体化脑分区。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Conclusion: 有界拟合在ALC及其片段中具有理论优势，并通过SAT求解器实现验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Motivation: 现实世界中的观测数据通常来自不同环境，具有异构因果关系，而现有方法多基于单一因果机制，无法有效处理此类问题。

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据集上，MCVCI和MCVCC表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCVCI和MCVCC能有效识别异构因果关系，揭示因果机制表达。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种通过混合SDE和ODE采样策略优化图像生成中人类偏好对齐的新框架，显著提升了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FlowGRPO）在MDP中需要对所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化，导致效率低下。

Method: MixGRPO结合SDE和ODE采样，引入滑动窗口机制，仅在窗口内进行SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样以减少随机性和优化开销。

Result: MixGRPO在人类偏好对齐的多维度上表现优异，训练时间减少50%，其变体MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%训练时间。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口设计，显著提升了效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合数值预测与语义指导在多变量时间序列预测中具有显著价值。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Conclusion: 该方法为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且鲁棒的目标推断框架，推动了交互性和适应性的发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Pain is a complex and pervasive condition that affects a significant portion
of the population. Accurate and consistent assessment is essential for
individuals suffering from pain, as well as for developing effective management
strategies in a healthcare system. Automatic pain assessment systems enable
continuous monitoring, support clinical decision-making, and help minimize

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疼痛评估对患者和临床决策至关重要，但传统方法存在局限性。自动评估系统通过生理信号提供客观数据，减少痛苦并防止功能衰退。

Method: 利用电皮肤活动信号生成多种表征，并通过多表征图联合可视化。结合多种处理和过滤技术进行实验验证。

Result: 该方法在多种表征组合下表现优异，效果与传统融合方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为信号表征或多模态融合提供了稳健的替代方案，适用于下一代疼痛评估系统。

Abstract: Pain is a multifaceted phenomenon that affects a substantial portion of the
population. Reliable and consistent evaluation benefits those experiencing pain
and underpins the development of effective and advanced management strategies.
Automatic pain-assessment systems deliver continuous monitoring, inform
clinical decision-making, and aim to reduce distress while preventing
functional decline. By incorporating physiological signals, these systems
provide objective, accurate insights into an individual's condition. This study
has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for
Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline
that leverages electrodermal activity signals as input modality. Multiple
representations of the signal are created and visualized as waveforms, and they
are jointly visualized within a single multi-representation diagram. Extensive
experiments incorporating various processing and filtering techniques, along
with multiple representation combinations, demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach. It consistently yields comparable, and in several cases
superior, results to traditional fusion methods, establishing it as a robust
alternative for integrating different signal representations or modalities.

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population.
Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing
pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management
strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and
support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent
functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second
Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The
proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input
signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer
alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover,
experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly
optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger
counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both
short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby
enhancing the model's representational capacity.

TL;DR: UI-AGILE框架通过改进训练和推理阶段，解决了GUI代理在推理设计、奖励机制和视觉噪声方面的挑战，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计不合理、奖励机制低效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 1）训练阶段：引入连续奖励函数、"简单思考"奖励和裁剪重采样策略；2）推理阶段：提出分解定位与选择方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro上定位准确率提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE框架通过综合优化训练和推理，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和定位准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了UserBench，一个用户为中心的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在多轮、偏好驱动的交互中的表现，发现现有模型在用户意图对齐和偏好识别上存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在模糊、动态或间接表达目标时与用户主动协作的能力不足，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 提出UserBench基准，模拟用户从模糊目标出发，逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具决策。

Result: 评估显示，模型仅20%的回答完全符合用户意图，最先进模型通过主动交互发现的用户偏好不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型在用户对齐上的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text understanding and generation but
raise significant safety and ethical concerns in high-stakes applications. To
mitigate these risks, we present Libra-Guard, a cutting-edge safeguard system
designed to enhance the safety of Chinese-based LLMs. Leveraging a two-stage
curriculum training pipeline, Libra-Guard enhances data efficiency by employing
guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on
manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce
Libra-Test, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain
experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy,

These contributions establish a robust framework for advancing the safety
governance of Chinese LLMs and represent a tentative step toward developing
safer, more reliable Chinese AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的零样本HAR方法存在隐私风险、依赖外部服务及预测不一致等问题，需要替代方案。

Method: 利用自然语言建模传感器数据和活动，通过其嵌入实现零样本分类。

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明，该方法能有效支持零样本HAR系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为无需LLM的零样本HAR提供了可行方案，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold huge potential for usage in the
medical domain, but their computational costs necessitate efficient compression
techniques. This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and
activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical
applications. We propose a novel layer selection method for pruning, analyze
different quantization techniques, and assess the performance trade-offs in a
prune-SFT-quantize pipeline. Our proposed method enables MLLMs with 7B
parameters to run within 4 GB of VRAM, reducing memory usage by 70% while
achieving 4% higher model performance compared to traditional pruning and
quantization techniques in the same compression ratio.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PHAX是一个公共健康解释框架，通过结构化论证生成面向用户的AI解释，提升透明度和信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释AI方法缺乏对多样化健康利益相关者的适应性和结构性，需要更清晰、上下文相关且社会可问责的解释。

Method: PHAX结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知的、面向特定受众的论证。

Result: PHAX在医疗术语简化、医患沟通和政策论证等用例中展示了其适用性，提升了可解释性和信任。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了公共健康领域透明、以人为中心的AI发展。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练方法依赖大数据和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力。受维果茨基社会文化理论启发，研究试图通过社会互动弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 设计了‘AI Social Gym’动态环境，学习者AI与教师AI进行教学对话，重点研究不同教学策略对知识获取的影响。

Result: 实验表明，双向对话（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLM知识获取与应用能力，优于单向教学或直接访问结构化知识。

Conclusion: 将教学与心理学洞见融入AI训练可显著提升知识获取与响应质量，为现有方法（如提示工程）提供补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Result: AI生成字数对评分有正面影响，但编辑行为对质量提升有限。

Conclusion: 需结合体裁教学和过程写作，评估应重视过程与成果，以促进对AI文本的批判性使用。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

Motivation: 研究GPT-4如何根据问题的情感语调调整回应，揭示由情感框架驱动的未充分探索的偏差。

Method: 系统变化156个提示的情感语调，分析模型回应，引入“语调下限”和语调-效价转换矩阵量化行为。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回应显著减少，敏感话题中情绪影响被抑制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了由情感框架驱动的偏差，对AI对齐和信任有重要影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面检测微调或遗忘操作对模型行为的意外副作用，如跨任务性能下降。

Method: MNEME通过稀疏模型差异分析比较基础模型和微调模型在任务无关数据上的行为变化。

Result: 在三种场景下，MNEME预测副作用的准确率达95%，且无需自定义启发式方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理模型行为提供了可扩展且自动化的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的特征增强Transformer架构，用于新闻句子主观性检测，在多语言和零样本设置中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻句子中作者主观观点与客观事实的区分问题，提升跨语言主观性检测的性能。

Method: 使用预训练Transformer模型（如AraELECTRA和DeBERTa~V3）结合TF-IDF和POS标签特征，通过门控机制优化特征融合。

Result: 在英语、阿拉伯语、德语等语言中取得竞争性表现，零样本设置下部分语言排名靠前（如英语第一，罗马尼亚语第一）。

Conclusion: 特征融合和跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型对语言顺序和语言相似性敏感。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StructText是一个自动生成高质量基准的框架，用于从文本中提取键值对，利用现有表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过多维评估策略确保文本与结构化数据的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对特定领域或组织的基准来评估大型语言模型（LLM）的提取质量，手动标注基准耗时且难以扩展。

Method: StructText采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据生成自然语言文本，并通过LLM判断和客观提取指标进行多维评估。

Result: 在71,539个示例上的评估显示，LLM在事实准确性和避免幻觉方面表现良好，但在叙事连贯性和可提取性上存在困难。

Conclusion: StructText为键值提取研究提供了框架、数据集和工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

Motivation: 探索广告内容措辞对广告可见性的影响，尤其是在LLM集成检索系统中。

Method: 引入监督微调框架，结合自定义损失函数平衡语义相关性和内容保真度，使用DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K作为评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，PPO训练模型在大多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告措辞、提示格式和强化学习对LLM集成检索系统中的广告重写效果至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种客观测量阿拉伯语修辞密度的方法，通过分析文本中的文学手法密度来评估修辞使用情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管阿拉伯语修辞历史悠久且地位崇高，但目前缺乏客观方法评估其在文本中的使用程度、比较不同作者或时代的修辞运用。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见文学手法的清单，构建了识别系统，并基于词素计数计算手法密度，开发了电子和模拟工具支持计算。

Result: 研究成功开发了一套工具，能够准确报告任何阿拉伯语文本或演讲中的修辞密度及其分布。

Conclusion: 该工具填补了阿拉伯语修辞研究中的空白，为客观分析和比较修辞使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的内部激活轨迹如何变化，以揭示模型的几何结构和推理动态。

Method: 使用Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型，通过20个匹配提示和五种原生空间度量（如曲率和显著性）进行分析。

Result: LLaMA模型在语义关注强度增加时表现出显著的曲率和显著性变化，而Gemma反应较弱。

Conclusion: Curved Inference揭示了模型的几何结构和推理动态，为诊断模型对齐和语义抽象提供了新方法。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more

Result: 在MultiHop RAG和Wikipedia数据集上表现优于传统RAG方法，检索信息更相关准确。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供高效、准确的领域专用LLM流程，避免资源密集型微调，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

Conclusion: NLP是现代数据驱动保险分析的基础工具，而不仅仅是辅助手段。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在高风险领域的广泛应用，领域特定安全性和合规性评估变得至关重要，但现有研究多关注性能提升而忽视安全风险。

Method: 基于专业伦理准则（如医学、法律、金融）定义领域安全原则，并开发Trident-Bench基准测试，评估19个通用和领域专用模型。

Result: 通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）满足基本安全要求，而领域专用模型在伦理细节上表现不佳，凸显领域安全改进的紧迫性。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为LLM在专业领域的安全性研究提供了系统性资源，为未来降低部署风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Result: 问题解释多样性在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa上表现更优；模型多样性结果介于最佳和最差成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释困难，现有激活归因方法易受类别无关特征干扰，影响解释可靠性。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入与参考激活，过滤无关特征，生成更清晰的归因图。

Result: 实验表明Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上优于现有方法，AOPC和LOdds指标显著提升。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT有效提升Transformer文本分类模型的可解释性，为实际应用提供更可靠解释。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Bangla BERT的模型，用于检测孟加拉语中的超党派新闻，并通过半监督学习和LIME解释提升了分类准确性和透明度，取得了95.65%的高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在孟加拉语等低资源语言中，缺乏有效的自然语言处理方法来检测超党派新闻，导致偏见内容传播，影响公共话语。

Method: 研究通过微调Bangla BERT模型，结合半监督学习和LIME解释，提升分类性能。

Result: Bangla BERT在试验数据中取得了95.65%的准确率，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，Transformer模型也能有效提升超党派新闻检测的准确性，为该领域的进一步研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

*Christoph Metzner,Shang Gao,Drahomira Herrmannova,Heidi A. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床理由的额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性，结果发现理由对性能提升有限，且不如增加报告数据有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床理由作为额外监督是否能提升模型性能和可解释性，以优化临床文本分类任务。

Method: 分析了99,125条人类临床理由和128,649份电子病理报告，评估了基于Transformer的模型在提取原发癌症部位时的表现，并研究了理由质量度量方法。

Result: 临床理由在高资源场景下能提升性能，但在资源有限时表现不一致；使用理由训练的模型性能不如增加报告数据。

Conclusion: 若目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非理由；若注重可解释性，理由补充数据可能有助于模型识别理由类特征。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型（LLMs）在捕捉跨文化道德差异方面表现不佳，倾向于压缩差异且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德观点的差异与相似性，以解决其潜在偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德分数方差、进行聚类对齐分析、直接通过系统性选择的词对提示模型。

Result: LLMs未能完全复现跨文化道德差异，且与调查数据的对齐度较低。

Conclusion: 需改进LLMs以减少偏见并提升文化代表性，强调公平与伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的网页历史压缩方法，通过固定长度的短表示提取历史状态中的关键信息，提升了网页自动化任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且网页状态信息冗长导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏，影响了历史状态的有效利用。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，将每个历史状态中最相关的任务信息压缩为固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上的实验表明，该方法比基线方法（无历史输入）的绝对准确率提高了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 通过压缩历史状态信息，显著提升了网页自动化任务的性能。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种模式：自主代理模式、工作流模式和混合模式，实验显示不同模式在工具移除效率和任务完成准确性上表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了LLM代理在多轮交互中的有效性，需要一种动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文的方法。

Method: 引入MemTool框架，提供三种代理架构模式（自主代理、工作流、混合），并在ScaleMCP基准上评估其性能。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型模型上工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中小型模型效率低（0-60%）；工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现一致，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了灵活的模式选择，需根据任务准确性、代理能力和模型性能权衡使用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种本地可部署、高效的因果LLM，以提升旅行模式选择的预测准确性和解释性，同时降低成本和保护隐私。

Method: 研究通过微调因果LLM（LiTransMC），采用参数高效和损失掩码策略，并在三个数据集上测试了396种配置。使用BERTopic和新型解释强度指数评估模型生成的理由。

Result: LiTransMC在加权F1分数（0.6845）和Jensen-Shannon散度（0.000245）上表现优异，超越了未调优模型、GPT-4o及传统方法（如离散选择模型）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合预测和自然语言推理，可以开发出高效、可解释的本地LLM，为交通研究和政策制定提供新工具。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

Motivation: 随着推理模型在数学和科学领域的基准逐渐饱和，需要新颖且具有挑战性的评估来衡量模型在非STEM领域的智能表现。幽默理解涉及复杂的推理，是评估模型智能的理想领域。

Method: HumorBench包含约300个来自《纽约客》字幕竞赛和Cartoonstock.com的卡通-字幕对，通过专家标注的评估标准识别笑话要素。评估LLM对幽默的解释能力和识别笑话要素的能力。

Result: 研究发现：（1）LLM在STEM推理上的进步能有效迁移到幽默理解；（2）仅基于STEM推理数据训练的模型在HumorBench上表现良好；（3）增加推理令牌预算对幽默推理的效果因模型而异。

Conclusion: HumorBench为评估LLM在复杂幽默理解中的推理能力提供了有效工具，并展示了推理能力的广泛迁移性。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

Result: 在MMLU任务中准确率提升4%，标注成本降低80%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，显著减少标注需求，同时提升模型性能，适用于多种任务和数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

Result: 构建了包含41个数据集和6项任务的越南文本嵌入基准VN-MTEB，发现使用Rotary Positional Embedding的更大更复杂模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南文本嵌入任务提供了高质量基准，有助于推动相关研究和应用。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

Conclusion: 人格向量提供了一种自动化方法，可用于监控和调整模型行为，防止不良人格变化。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Token Map Drafting的无模型推测解码技术，用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统，特别适用于资源受限设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码（SD）方法需要额外的草稿模型，不适用于缺乏硬件加速器（如GPU）的设备。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预计算的n-gram token map替代草稿模型，实现高效的推测解码，减少计算开销。

Result: 在CI-AVSR数据集和内部数据集上分别实现了1.27倍和1.37倍的解码加速，且不降低识别准确率。

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting是一种高效的无模型推测解码技术，适用于资源受限设备上的ASR应用。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种无需训练的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，显著减少计算开销，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态稀疏注意力方法会降低准确性，而动态稀疏方法因运行时稀疏索引估计引入额外计算开销。

Method: TriangleMix在浅层使用密集注意力，深层切换为三角形稀疏模式。

Result: 实验表明，TriangleMix在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: TriangleMix可无缝结合动态稀疏方法进一步提升效率，展示了增强LLM推理效率的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

### [107] [Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT): An Integrated Morphosyntactic Framework for a Low-Resource Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21536)
*Jiaxin Zuo,Yiquan Wang,Yuan Pan,Xiadiya Yibulayin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究针对维吾尔语自然语言处理资源不足的问题，提出了一种依赖标注框架，并通过实验验证其必要性，最终构建了更准确的维吾尔语依赖树库（MUDT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决维吾尔语作为低资源、黏着语在自然语言处理中依赖标注的不足，填补资源空白。

Method: 设计了包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 实验显示现有通用标注方案与维吾尔语结构存在47.9%的系统性差异，验证了定制化标注的必要性。

Conclusion: MUDT提供了更准确且语义透明的标注方案，不仅提升了维吾尔语解析性能，还为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复用的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

*Jungyeon Lee,Kangmin Lee,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于知识图谱（KG）的框架MAGIC，用于生成多样且微妙的知识冲突，以解决现有基准在RAG系统中的局限性。实验表明，LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在RAG系统中存在局限性，如局限于问答设置、依赖实体替换技术及冲突类型有限，因此需要更全面的方法来研究知识冲突。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱的框架MAGIC，生成多样且微妙的冲突，利用KG的显式关系结构确保可解释性。

Result: 实验显示，开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测和多跳推理中表现不佳，且难以准确定位矛盾来源。

Conclusion: 论文为改进LLMs整合多样（甚至冲突）信息提供了深入分析基础。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

*Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao,Kevin Tang,Dinah Baer-Henney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于Transformer的神经网络与人类行为数据在西班牙语不规则形态模式上的表现，发现模型在准确率上优于人类，但在响应偏好上存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型是否能像人类一样对复杂的语言现象（形态模式）表现出敏感性。

Method: 使用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在自然、低频和高频动词分布条件下的表现。

Result: 模型在词干和后缀准确率上优于人类，但响应偏好与人类不同，且受训练数据中不规则动词比例的影响。

Conclusion: 模型对形态模式的敏感性受训练数据分布影响，与人类行为存在明显差异。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

*Aarón Galiano-Jiménez,Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz,Felipe Sánchez-Martínez,Víctor M. Sánchez-Cartagena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多假设蒸馏（MHD）方法，通过生成多个翻译句子来改进序列级知识蒸馏，提升学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师模型的输出分布包含更多信息，而不仅仅是束搜索的近似模式，因此需要更全面地利用这些信息来指导学生模型。

Method: 利用束搜索的n-best列表生成多个翻译句子，增加目标侧前缀的多样性，并尝试其他解码方法解决低变异性和低频词不足的问题。

Result: 对于低资源语言，采样方法虽略微降低翻译质量，但增加了变异性和词汇丰富性，提升了学生模型性能并减少了性别偏见。

Conclusion: MHD方法通过多假设蒸馏有效提升了学生模型的表现，并减少了知识蒸馏中的性别偏见问题。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，且依赖参考答案和固定输出格式，限制了强化学习的扩展和模型推理能力的持续提升。

Method: 构建了推理导向的基准（Libra Bench），并提出了基于学习思考方法的生成奖励模型改进方法，开发了Libra-RM系列模型。

Result: Libra-RM系列在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，实验证明了Libra Bench与下游应用的相关性，以及Libra-RM利用未标记数据提升推理模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了奖励模型的局限性，为推理能力的持续提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

*Raj Vardhan Tomar,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UnsafeChain是一个安全对齐数据集，通过纠正不安全行为提升模型安全性，同时保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注过滤安全提示，忽视了引发有害输出的硬提示，UnsafeChain填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示及其纠正后的安全响应，并微调三个大型推理模型。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法在提升模型安全性和泛化能力方面有效。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and
code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/UnsafeChain

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的附加模块，通过移除实例级主成分增强预训练语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，无需依赖传统对抗防御或扰动原始数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在自然语言处理中表现优异，但对对抗攻击脆弱，现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 通过移除实例级主成分，将嵌入空间转换为近似高斯分布，减少对抗扰动敏感性。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上验证，该方法提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持与基线相当的原始准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性和泛化性之间取得了平衡，无需对抗样本或昂贵训练增强。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Motivation: 解决农业领域缺乏大语言模型训练数据和评估基准的问题。

Method: 构建AgriEval基准，包含多类题型和高质量数据，对51种开源和商业模型进行测试。

Result: 大多数模型准确率不足60%，表明农业领域大语言模型发展潜力巨大。

Conclusion: AgriEval为农业领域的大语言模型评估提供了重要工具，并揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对不安全行为的鲁棒性是一个重要课题，但目前缺乏对安全分类器及其评估数据集在多语言场景下的研究。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的5个安全分类模型，揭示多语言差异，并指出评估数据集的问题。

Result: 发现当前安全分类器的不足不仅源于模型本身，还与评估数据集有关。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于推动开发更好的多语言有害内容识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在减少毒品使用危害信息提供中的表现，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 构建HRIP-Basic数据集（2160个问答证据对），涵盖三个任务，并设计Instruction和RAG方案评估模型。

Result: 当前先进LLMs在提供准确信息方面表现不佳，且存在严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减少毒品使用危害的语境中，应谨慎使用LLMs以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理等任务至关重要，但现有研究较少关注这一领域。

Method: 使用句子Transformer和Transformer模型（如RoBERTa）对16K英语句子对进行建模实验。

Result: 句子Transformer表现不佳，甚至不如RoBERTa；评估方法的不平衡影响了结果的可信度。

Conclusion: 需要更平衡的评估方法，并进一步优化模型以提升事件合理性变化评估的性能。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管研究者提出了多种提示策略，但其效果因LLM和任务而异，目前仍依赖试错法。HALC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HALC流程，通过1,512个提示和200万次请求测试不同提示策略，基于专家编码（ground truth）评估LLM任务表现。

Result: 发现某些提示策略能可靠编码单一变量（αclimate = .76；αmovement = .78）和跨变量（αclimate = .71；αmovement = .74）。

Conclusion: HALC为不同提示策略的有效性、关键影响因素及可靠提示的识别提供了见解。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个基于强化学习的框架，使大型语言模型（LLMs）能自主决定在推理过程中是否及如何使用外部工具，提升任务性能和工具使用的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理（TIR）方法依赖预定义的工具使用模式，可能损害语言模型的核心能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，因此需要更灵活的方法。

Method: AutoTIR通过强化学习框架，结合任务答案正确性、结构化输出和工具使用惩罚的混合奖励机制，优化推理和工具集成。

Result: 在知识密集型、数学和通用语言建模任务中，AutoTIR显著优于基线方法，并展现出更好的工具使用泛化能力。

Conclusion: AutoTIR展示了强化学习在构建可泛化和可扩展的TIR能力中的潜力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

*Haoran Luo,Haihong E,Guanting Chen,Qika Lin,Yikai Guo,Fangzhi Xu,Zemin Kuang,Meina Song,Xiaobao Wu,Yifan Zhu,Luu Anh Tuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过端到端强化学习改进GraphRAG，解决了传统方法的高成本、固定检索和长上下文依赖问题，提升了推理准确性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GraphRAG方法存在构建成本高、检索固定且依赖长上下文推理和提示设计的问题，Graph-R1旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出Graph-R1框架，采用轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化代理过程。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统GraphRAG和RL增强的RAG方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习优化了GraphRAG的性能，为知识增强生成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

*Qinyuan Wu,Soumi Das,Mahsa Amani,Bishwamittra Ghosh,Mohammad Aflah Khan,Krishna P. Gummadi,Muhammad Bilal Zafar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段记忆-泛化框架，证明LLMs可以从死记硬背的数据中泛化，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨死记硬背是否阻碍泛化，并研究LLMs如何通过记忆数据实现泛化。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先用无意义标记记忆事实关联，再用少量语义提示微调以泛化。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，形成结构化、语义对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 这一发现为高效知识注入和潜在恶意利用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

*Lujain Ibrahim,Franziska Sofia Hafner,Luc Rocher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，优化语言模型以表现温暖和同理心会显著降低其可靠性，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时，导致错误率上升和潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI语言模型在追求温暖和同理心时可能牺牲的可靠性，尤其是在安全关键任务中的表现。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率、传播阴谋论、提供错误信息和医疗建议方面表现更差，且更容易验证用户的错误信念。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型的开发和评估需重新考虑，以平衡温暖与可靠性，避免潜在风险。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出RLSF方法，通过模型自身的置信度作为内在奖励，优化LLM的校准和推理能力，无需外部反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成答案校准性差的问题，模仿人类在没有外部反馈时的学习方式。

Method: 利用冻结LLM生成多个推理链，计算每个答案的置信度并排序，通过偏好优化微调策略。

Result: RLSF提升了模型的校准性和逐步推理能力，在算术推理和选择题任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: RLSF证明了利用模型自身不确定性作为内在奖励的有效性，为LLM后训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

*Tianyi Hu,Andrea Morales-Garzón,Jingyi Zheng,Maria Maistro,Daniel Hershcovich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CARRIAGE框架，通过增强检索和上下文组织的多样性，解决RAG在跨文化食谱适应中输出单一的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG在跨文化食谱适应中因过度依赖有限上下文而无法生成多样化结果，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，改进RAG的检索和上下文组织以增强多样性。

Result: CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上达到帕累托效率，优于封闭式LLM。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求多样化输出的RAG框架，有效解决了现有问题。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

*Hyunwoo Yoo,Gail L. Rosen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在微生物组研究中，传统机器学习模型难以泛化的问题，提出使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行分类和预测，结果显示LLMs在零样本和小样本设置下优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中泛化能力不足的问题，尤其是在小样本或异构标签格式的情况下。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Grok-3和LLaMA 4等LLMs，在零样本和小样本设置下进行分类和预测，并与随机森林等传统模型进行比较。

Result: LLMs在分类和预测污染风险方面优于基线模型，且能跨站点和元数据分布泛化。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种有前景的元数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

TL;DR: DeepSieve是一个基于LLM的RAG框架，通过分解查询和多阶段信息过滤，提升知识密集型任务的推理深度和检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在知识密集型查询上表现不佳，现有RAG方法缺乏对查询和源的细粒度控制，导致检索噪声和浅层推理。

Method: DeepSieve通过LLM作为知识路由器，将复杂查询分解为结构化子问题，并递归路由到最合适的知识源，多阶段过滤无关信息。

Result: 实验表明，DeepSieve在多跳QA任务中优于传统RAG方法，推理深度、检索精度和可解释性均有提升。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化、透明和适应性设计，为知识密集型任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于IMU的运动分类模型开发中数据稀缺和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 收集19名参与者的运动康复和步态数据，使用同步的IMU和MoCap系统，并提供处理后的数据和工具。

Result: 提供包含原始和处理数据的多模态数据集，支持机器学习模型开发和验证。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在加速机器学习在人类运动分析中的应用，并促进研究的可重复性。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

Result: 零样本下达到73%的预测准确率，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可增强时空感知，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但这类指令通常模糊，难以支持细粒度编辑。

Method: 提出多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；构建ChartM3基准和ChartM3-Train训练集。

Result: 实验显示当前多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示器理解和执行方面存在局限，但通过ChartM3-Train微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对构建实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了基准和工具。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用带有梯度惩罚的Wasserstein损失（WGANGP）训练DCGAN模型，对2322张质量不一的X光片进行预处理和训练，探索了四种候选模型。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可见性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型在整体清晰度上更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来基于GAN的牙科影像方法提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

Motivation: 解释DNN如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述是一个挑战，现有性能指标无法提供深入见解。

Method: 使用HMLNs学习训练实例的分布，并通过条件生成样本推断分布变化，量化哪些实例对生成描述提供了更丰富的信息。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能提供可解释的解释，并比较不同图像描述模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解DNN在多模态任务中的决策提供了新视角，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

Motivation: 解决使用ERP格式时在极点和边界产生的失真和伪影问题，提升环境图的质量和准确性。

Method: 1. 提出ERP卷积填充以消除边界伪影；2. 设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境图在图像质量和光照准确性上均具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了ERP格式的伪影问题，但PanoDiT在减少失真的同时牺牲了部分图像质量和合理性。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析其在不同患者亚组（年龄、性别、种族）和任务（如气胸）中的表现。

Result: 不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，其他属性表现较公平；模型对胸管等虚假相关性依赖较强。

Conclusion: CLIP模型在医学任务中存在公平性和鲁棒性问题，需进一步改进以减少对虚假特征的依赖。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，仅需普通2D设备即可实现3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高可访问性、真实性和真实感的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过同时关注全局和局部特征，有效解决了管状结构分割中的碎片化问题，为医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰词并分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能在添加修饰词后一致下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于理解VLMs的局限性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VLM适应动作检测任务中的挑战，展示了在有限示例下的高效性能。

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务协作显著提升了BEV 3D检测性能，填补了空间表示和特征优化的空白。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife

public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN

Result: 实验验证PDAF在多样化城市场景中的有效性，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: PDAF通过迭代建模域偏移，逐步优化特征表示，为复杂目标条件下的语义分割提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

Conclusion: ReGATE有效加速训练并减少令牌数量，同时保持或超越模型性能。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

Motivation: 传统的地图构建模型仅提供确定性点估计，无法处理现实环境中的模糊性（如遮挡和缺失的车道标记）。

Method: MapDiffusion利用扩散模型，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件化。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和原型对齐，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂低光场景中难以实现可靠的角-时域建模，限制了光场在场景感知中的应用。

Method: 提出ESI表示方法，利用光场中的几何结构增强视觉表达；设计ATINet网络，学习角感知表示并进行自监督优化。

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中达到最优性能，并扩展至多目标跟踪验证其有效性。

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet为光场角-时域建模提供了高效解决方案，尤其在低光场景中表现优异。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放集3D物体检索任务中因训练数据不足而难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP模型在图像-文本对上的预训练提供了泛化能力。

Method: DAC框架结合CLIP和MLLM，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并在推理时提供未知物体的外部提示。引入AB-LoRA技术缓解过拟合并增强泛化能力。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均mAP提升10.01%，并在图像基础和跨数据集设置中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的框架显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能，展示了多模态模型的潜力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at
https://github.com/wangzhichuan123/DAC.

Result: 实验验证了VAGU基准、GtS框架和JeAUG指标的有效性。

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG改进了评估方式。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的语义一致性和连贯性问题。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种冲突抑制的深度伪造检测框架（CS-DFD），通过解决梯度冲突问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测模型在联合训练原始数据和在线合成伪造数据时性能下降，这与通常认为增加数据应提升性能的观点相矛盾。研究发现这是由于梯度冲突导致的。

Method: CS-DFD包含两个模块：1）更新向量搜索（UVS）模块，通过极值优化找到最大化损失减少的更新向量；2）冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，通过冲突下降损失惩罚梯度方向不一致，学习对齐的特征表示。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过解决梯度冲突问题，显著提升了深度伪造检测模型的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，实现了CNN剪枝的新突破。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

TL;DR: TARS是一种基于token自适应的偏好优化策略，通过最小化偏好损失和最大化分布偏移来减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合语言线索，导致视觉信息的基础性不足。

Method: TARS将DPO重新表述为一个最小-最大优化问题，通过最大化token级分布偏移（模拟对齐不确定性）和最小化偏好损失来提升模型的可靠性。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，TARS仅使用4.8k偏好样本，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4，性能优于标准DPO并与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: TARS通过动态优化策略有效减少了多模态推理中的幻觉问题，同时保持了视觉信息的因果基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

### [166] [Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Self-Supervised Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21606)
*Yaozong Zheng,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Ning Li,Shuxiang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督跟踪框架SSTrack，无需手动标注框，通过时空一致性训练和实例对比损失实现高效跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪数据集依赖人工标注框，成本高且限制数据规模和多样性，需开发自监督方法减少依赖。

Method: 采用解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位和局部时间关联，设计实例对比损失学习实例级对应关系。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC（AO）分数在GOT10K、LaSOT和TrackingNet上分别提升25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注框的依赖，性能优于现有自监督跟踪方法。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

TL;DR: DeepLabv3模型在iPS细胞集落分割任务中表现优于大型基础模型（如SAM2和MedSAM2），表明在特定任务中，简单模型可能更有效。

Motivation: 探讨在低对比度边界的专业任务中，模型复杂性是否总是必要的，并验证简单模型的潜力。

Method: 使用DeepLabv3模型进行iPS细胞集落分割，未对结构进行修改。

Result: DeepLabv3在实验条件下优于SAM2和MedSAM2，表明简单模型在特定任务中更有效。

Conclusion: 在专业生物医学应用中，适当调整的简单模型可能提供更高的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Result: 模型在合成和真实图像上表现优异，Pose mAP50-95达0.97。

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升模型性能，适用于复杂场景的风力涡轮机检测。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测对制造系统的安全和可靠性至关重要，但现有MLLMs在IAD中表现有限，需领域特定适应。

Method: EMIT构建多任务IAD数据集，利用GPT生成文本描述补充缺陷图像缺失，整合软提示和热图引导的对比嵌入，并提出难度感知GRPO优化策略。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均比基础模型（InternVL3-8B）提高7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过难度感知GRPO和综合数据增强策略，有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要修改架构和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法虽减少计算，但缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致或视觉不真实。

Method: GuidPaint通过将分类器引导融入去噪过程，实现对掩码区域的精确控制，并结合随机和确定性采样策略。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估中均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的修复方案，显著提升了修复质量。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent
surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the
continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene
adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding

opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and
LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The
surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need
for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first
comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing

empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

TL;DR: APT框架通过统计匹配和尺度感知调度解决了基于patch方法的分布偏移和单调性问题，提升了高分辨率图像生成的细节和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定分辨率的LDMs在高分辨率图像生成中存在限制，而基于训练的方法需要大量数据和计算资源。基于patch的方法虽流行，但存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，解决patch方法的分布偏移和单调性问题，并实现快速采样。

Result: APT生成的高分辨率图像细节更清晰，推理速度更快，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去标识化方法未能有效保留医学语义且缺乏隐私级别灵活性，需解决这些问题。

Method: 分步框架：1) 身份阻断调整隐私级别；2) 利用预训练医学基础模型补偿语义，并通过特征解耦去除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三项下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护和医学语义保留方面达到最优性能。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究通过明确内部组件对性能的贡献，推动了检测Transformer的可解释AI发展，为优化透明度和效率提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现出优越性。

Conclusion: SAMITE模型有效解决了目标跟踪中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新的对齐机制和训练策略，有效解决了多模态学习中的语义损失问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，解决了现有细粒度图像检索方法因依赖预定义类别而泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，限制了其对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将FGIR任务重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈机制，成功学习到类别无关的差异表示，提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域因标注数据稀缺且昂贵而难以应用大型语言和视觉语言模型的问题。

Method: 采用1-shot RLVR范式，通过策略梯度优化，仅需一个示例即可对齐模型输出。

Result: 实验表明，即使一个示例也能显著提升性能，128个示例可媲美数千标注样本训练的模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

TL;DR: LiteFat是一种轻量级时空图学习模型，用于高效检测驾驶员疲劳，具有高精度和低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Method: 通过面部关键点检测将视频数据转换为时空图，使用MobileNet提取特征，轻量级时空图神经网络识别疲劳。

Result: 实验表明，LiteFat在降低计算复杂性和延迟的同时，性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

TL;DR: MoR-ViT提出了一种动态递归机制，通过自适应调整每个token的处理深度，显著减少了参数冗余和计算成本，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT架构存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际部署。现有方法多为静态压缩或固定深度处理，无法动态适应输入。

Method: 引入Mixture-of-Recursions（MoR）范式，实现token级动态递归，使每个token能自适应确定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等基准测试中，MoR-ViT实现了70%参数减少和2.5倍推理加速，且性能优于DynamicViT和TinyViT。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为可扩展和可部署的深度学习模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AU-LLM的新框架，首次利用大型语言模型（LLM）检测微表情动作单元（AUs），解决了数据稀缺和强度低的问题，并在基准数据集上取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情AUs检测是情感计算中的关键挑战，但现有方法在数据稀缺和低强度领域表现不足。LLMs具有强大的推理能力，但其在微表情AUs检测中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 论文提出AU-LLM框架，通过增强融合投影器（EFP）将3D-CNN提取的中高层视觉特征融合为密集令牌，供LLM进行推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，AU-LLM在LOSO和跨域协议下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM证明了LLM在微表情分析中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在新类别泛化上表现不佳，且复杂架构或计算开销大。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，MSGCoOp显著提升基类到新类的泛化性能，平均调和均值提高1.10%。

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本和跨域泛化任务中表现出色，且计算高效。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像-文本预训练模型难以处理医学数据的变异性和模糊性，限制了其对临床细微信息和不确定性的捕捉能力。

Method: 基于胸部X射线，利用大型语言模型生成结构化文本报告，结合图像数据，并通过建模模态内和模态间的不确定性来捕捉医学图像和文本的模糊性。

Result: 模型在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强医学图像与临床相关文本的对齐，显著提升了医学图像分析的泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0在虚拟现实、游戏开发等领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Result: 研究发现，从输入过滤到输出验证的每个审核阶段都可能被绕过，且这些策略易于在现实环境中复制。

Conclusion: 论文强调迫切需要开发上下文感知的防御方法，以应对这些易于复制的越狱策略。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，结合跨架构不变性最大化和特征解耦目标，并设计轻量模块保护学生模型的架构特定能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上优于OFA方法，参数开销更少。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，可作为跨架构蒸馏领域的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），用于RGB-D视频显著性目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化光学流和深度的利用，显著提升了性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在处理光学流和深度时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SMFNet框架，包含PSF策略和MSAM模块，分别实现光学流和深度的选择性融合及多维特征增强。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，SMFNet优于19种现有模型，成为当前最全面的RGB-D VSOD基准。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和注意力机制有效提升了RGB-D VSOD的性能，验证了其优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供了即插即用的性能提升方案。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下性能提升约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成方法有效提升了指向对象识别的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with

Result: 在多样化的叙事提示下，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 研究AI在病理学中可能学习到的种族偏见，以确保其公平部署。

Method: 使用多站点数据集和注意力机制，评估三种数据整理策略，分析形态学特征。

Result: 模型对白人和黑人种族的预测性能较高（AUC：0.799, 0.762），整体性能降至0.663。表皮是关键预测特征。

Conclusion: 需谨慎数据整理和偏见缓解，以确保AI在病理学中的公平应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

*Nicola Fanelli,Gennaro Vessio,Giovanna Castellano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtSeek是一个多模态框架，结合了多模态大型语言模型和检索增强生成技术，用于分析数字化艺术品，无需依赖外部链接即可实现高精度分类和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化艺术品的分析需要结合视觉解读和丰富的艺术、历史背景知识，现有方法依赖外部链接，限制了适用范围。

Method: ArtSeek包含多模态检索模块、对比多任务分类网络和基于上下文的推理策略，利用WikiFragments数据集支持知识驱动的多模态推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最佳成绩，风格分类F1提升8.4%，ArtPedia上的标题生成BLEU@1提升7.1%。

Conclusion: ArtSeek不仅能解析视觉主题和历史背景，还适用于其他需要外部知识的领域，推动了可扩展的多模态AI研究。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available
at https://github.com/cilabuniba/artseek.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型SwinECAT，结合了Swin Attention和ECA Attention，用于提升眼底图像分类的准确性和粒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼底图像分析面临小病变区域和疾病间细微差异的挑战，导致模型预测准确性下降和过拟合。

Method: 提出SwinECAT模型，结合Swin Attention捕捉局部和长程依赖，ECA Attention优化特征通道关注。

Result: 在EDID数据集上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类中表现最佳，为当前公开数据集的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

TL;DR: MMAT-1M是一个百万规模的多模态代理调优数据集，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在思维链、反思和动态工具使用方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建数据集：1) 收集公开多模态数据集；2) 利用GPT-4生成理性并整合API调用和RAG信息；3) 通过反思优化理性；4) 可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在多个基准测试中表现显著提升，平均提高2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升了多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

TL;DR: LMAC-Net提出了一种多模态注意力一致性机制，用于长期动作质量评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长期动作质量评估中难以捕捉多模态交互和关键性能变化，LMAC-Net旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入多模态注意力一致性机制，结合视觉和音频信息，使用局部查询编码模块和两级评分评估。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上，LMAC-Net表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和优化，有效提升了长期动作质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于mixup-class prompt的数据生成方法，用于解决数据自由量化中合成图像与量化模型泛化性之间的关系问题，显著提升了低比特量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由量化方法在生成合成图像时未充分研究其与量化模型泛化性的关系，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出mixup-class prompt策略，融合多类别标签生成多样且鲁棒的合成数据，并通过梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量支持。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低比特量化（W2A4）中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了量化模型的泛化性和优化稳定性，尤其在低比特场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需阴影掩码的阴影去除方法，结合自适应门控双分支注意力机制和扩散式频率对比融合网络，显著提升了复杂场景下的阴影去除效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖阴影掩码，但在实际场景中难以获取；局部对比信息虽可作为替代，但在复杂场景中存在模糊性。

Method: 提出AGBA机制动态过滤和重加权对比先验，结合FCFN网络利用高频和对比线索生成细节。

Result: 在无掩码方法中达到最优性能，与依赖掩码的方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN的结合有效解决了复杂场景中的阴影去除问题，为无掩码方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

<details>

Motivation: 工业烟雾等领域中像素级标签稀缺且标注困难，现有弱监督方法因监督差距和模型偏差导致前景覆盖不全、边界不准确等问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架结合CNN和ViT，引入跨架构一致性损失对齐内部表示，并加入后处理技术提升伪掩码质量。

Result: 新框架直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，改善了伪掩码的覆盖率和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现偏差问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确姿态信息，但实际场景中姿态获取成本高且易受噪声影响，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 将视角域的重建预训练扩展到全景域，引入RoPE滚动机制以建模全景图像的水平周期性。

Result: PanoSplatt3R在无姿态信息下，显著优于现有方法，生成高质量新视图和精确深度估计。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了无需姿态信息的全景重建潜力，具有广泛实用价值。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

Conclusion: 该方法为临床工作流程中的自动化心电图解读提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但事件流稀疏且噪声多，与密集图像数据融合困难，需要有效方法提取特征并融合。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征细化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM），通过注意力和门控策略对齐和融合多模态特征。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上，EIFNet达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件流特征提取和多模态融合问题，提升了事件语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Method: 设计了运动引导的骨骼调制模块（MSM）和运动引导的时间调制模块（MTM），分别从骨骼和帧级别注入运动线索，并通过运动一致性学习策略整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对微动作识别至关重要。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Motivation: 机器遗忘模型存在被对抗提示攻击的风险，现有方法在生成符合意图的内容和计算成本方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ZIUM方法，支持零样本对抗攻击，无需额外优化即可针对已遗忘概念生成攻击内容。

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现出色，攻击成功率高且显著减少攻击时间。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

*Yida Tao,Yen-Chia Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEDANet结合人类反馈和对抗特征对齐，显著提升工业烟雾分割性能，无需目标域标注即可接近全监督模型效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业烟雾分割中像素级标注成本高且稀缺的问题，结合公民科学和弱监督域适应。

Method: 通过公民投票优化伪标签，并利用类特定域判别器进行源域到目标域的特征对齐。

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数提升5倍，烟雾类IoU提升6倍。

Conclusion: CEDANet证明了公民科学与弱监督域适应结合的可行性和高效性，适用于数据稀缺的环境监测。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致。现有方法多为文本中心，视觉语义对齐的挑战限制了其效果。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像和构建视觉指令，增强模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，从而改善视觉语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，ViHallu显著减少了幻觉现象，并提升了模型的细粒度视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: ViHallu通过视觉中心的方法有效缓解了幻觉现象，并发布了ViHallu-Instruction数据集，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证密集音频-视觉模型在低资源、多语言和嘈杂环境中的有效性，特别是在发展中国家的实际应用场景。

Method: 比较了三种对比目标函数：全局均值池化损失、密集最大-均值令牌匹配器和一种简单混合方法，使用多语言数据集Project Vaani进行实验。

Result: 密集目标函数在音频-视觉检索中相对全局池化提升了59%的R@1，并显著降低了平均和中位数排名，同时能生成清晰的零样本定位热图。

Conclusion: 密集令牌路由在低资源环境中更具决定性，尤其是在标注和音频质量较差的情况下，而非仅适用于高资源英语语料库。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分割的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法，用于点云分类的神经网络，通过点偏移机制生成易于人类理解的显著性图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI的快速发展，理解其在关键领域决策过程的需求日益增长，尤其是点云数据的分类算法。

Method: 利用点云分割模型生成分类模型的解释，通过点偏移机制扰动输入数据，生成有意义的显著性图。

Result: 相比传统聚类方法，该方法生成的显著性图更具可解释性，并能有效展示分类算法的决策依据。

Conclusion: 该方法为点云分类提供了更直观的解释工具，有助于人类理解AI决策过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

TL;DR: S2E框架通过结合离线视频预训练和模拟环境强化学习，提升了导航基础模型的交互能力，同时保持其泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有导航基础模型仅依赖离线数据训练，缺乏对动作后果推理和适应能力的问题，特别是在需要交互和安全的真实城市导航中。

Method: 提出Seeing-to-Experiencing（S2E）框架，结合视频预训练和强化学习后训练，引入锚定引导分布匹配策略和残差注意力模块。

Result: S2E在NavBench-GS基准测试中表现出色，缓解了仅依赖离线数据时的性能递减问题，强化学习比监督微调更有效。

Conclusion: 交互式在线经验对扩展机器人基础模型至关重要，S2E为导航模型提供了更安全和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流方法倾向于使用深层网络，但浅层网络可能因提取更多非抽象视觉属性而被忽视。本文旨在验证浅层架构是否能在FGFSL中达到或超越深层网络的性能。

Method: 提出LCN-4网络，包含位置感知特征聚类模块，通过网格位置编码补偿和频域位置嵌入技术解决特征提取中的位置信息丢失问题。

Result: 在三个细粒度少样本基准测试中，LCN-4显著优于基于ConvNet-4的现有方法，并与大多数基于ResNet12的方法性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 浅层架构在FGFSL中具有潜力，LCN-4通过创新的位置感知模块实现了高性能，验证了浅层网络的可行性。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Result: 在密集3D重建和开放词汇3D分割任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Ov3R为实时、语义感知的空间AI迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MetaLab实现了接近99%的准确率，达到人类识别水平。

Conclusion: MetaLab在小样本图像识别中表现出色，具有高精度和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于离散自回归建模的图像生成方法存在视觉保真度低、输出扭曲和复杂指令遵循困难等问题，导致研究逐渐转向扩散模型与自回归模型的联合训练。本文旨在通过强化学习解决这些问题，实现图像与语言生成的无缝集成。

Method: 提出X-Omni框架，包括语义图像分词器、统一的自回归模型（用于语言和图像）和离线扩散解码器（用于图像生成）。通过强化学习优化生成质量。

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中达到最先进性能，使用7B语言模型生成高美学质量的图像，并展现出强大的指令遵循和长文本渲染能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习可以有效提升离散自回归建模的图像生成质量，X-Omni框架为图像与语言生成的统一建模提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频分析的主动学习框架，通过全视频选择和步态感知特征表示，显著减少标注成本并提高识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频分析中表现不佳，因为它们无法处理长视频中的步骤间依赖关系，且标注需要完整视频上下文。

Method: StepAL结合步态感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样化的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现更高的步骤识别准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效方法，显著降低了计算机辅助手术系统的开发成本。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态特性，限制了其在需要运动理解场景中的应用。

Result: 实验表明，DMA在少样本运动理解任务中表现优异，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 论文填补了运动引导FSVOS的空白，并展示了DMA方法的有效性。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: 生成式AI可扩展数据治理，弥合企业数据管理中的意图与实现差距。

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow
in complexity, manual authoring and maintenance of contracts becomes
error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

Result: 通过实验评估了dp-idp、RankSky和CoSky的性能。

Conclusion: RankSky和CoSky方法在高基数Skyline点比较中表现优异，且CoSky可直接嵌入DBMS。

Abstract: {Multi-criteria decision analysis in databases has been actively studied,
especially through the Skyline operator. Yet, few approaches offer a relevant
comparison of Pareto optimal, or Skyline, points for high cardinality result
sets. We propose to improve the dp-idp method, inspired by tf-idf, a recent
approach computing a score for each Skyline point, by introducing the concept
of dominance hierarchy. As dp-idp lacks efficiency and does not ensure a
distinctive rank, we introduce the RankSky method, the adaptation of Google's
well-known PageRank solution, using a square stochastic matrix, a teleportation
matrix, a damping factor, and then a row score eigenvector and the IPL
algorithm. For the same reasons as RankSky, and also to offer directly
embeddable in DBMS solution, we establish the TOPSIS based CoSky method,
derived from both information research and multi-criteria analysis. CoSky
automatically ponderates normalized attributes using the Gini index, then
computes a score using Salton's cosine toward an ideal point. By coupling
multilevel Skyline to dp-idp, RankSky or CoSky, we introduce DeepSky.
Implementations of dp-idp, RankSky and CoSky are evaluated experimentally.

Method: 引入了一个包含270万篇arXiv论文摘要嵌入向量的新数据集，并附带11种真实属性。对多种FANNS方法进行了基准测试。

Result: 不同方法在不同场景下表现各异，没有一种方法在所有情况下最优。例如，ACORN支持多种过滤类型但性能一般，SeRF在有序属性上表现优异但不支持分类属性。

Conclusion: FANNS领域需要针对不同场景选择合适的方法，没有通用的最佳解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress
across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation,
recommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition.
Many applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve
items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a
filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered
Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are
benchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the
current FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,
particularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding
models. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding
vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv
repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and
categories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and
find that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single
approach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports
various filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often
outperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for
range filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.
Filtered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the
large-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based
embeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier
embeddings. We conclude that no universally best method exists.

### [224] [Improving SpGEMM Performance Through Matrix Reordering and Cluster-wise Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21253)
*Abdullah Al Raqibul Islam,Helen Xu,Dong Dai,Aydın Buluç*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于层次聚类的稀疏矩阵乘法（SpGEMM）优化方法，通过行重排序和聚类计算提高数据局部性，平均加速1.39倍，预处理成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SpGEMM因不规则内存访问模式成为性能瓶颈，现有研究多集中于稀疏矩阵向量乘法（SpMV），缺乏针对SpGEMM的优化方案。

Method: 采用层次聚类结合行重排序和聚类计算，提出新的行聚类矩阵格式和访问模式，并解耦重排序算法与聚类格式。

Result: 实验表明，基于图分区的重排序性能更优但预处理成本高，而层次聚类方法在预处理时间相近的情况下平均加速更高。

Conclusion: 层次聚类方法显著提升SpGEMM性能，同时揭示了行重排序和聚类对SpGEMM的独立及联合作用。

Abstract: Sparse matrix-sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a key kernel in many
scientific applications and graph workloads. Unfortunately, SpGEMM is
bottlenecked by data movement due to its irregular memory access patterns.
Significant work has been devoted to developing row reordering schemes towards
improving locality in sparse operations, but prior studies mostly focus on the
case of sparse-matrix vector multiplication (SpMV).
  In this paper, we address these issues with hierarchical clustering for
SpGEMM that leverages both row reordering and cluster-wise computation to
improve reuse in the second input (B) matrix with a novel row-clustered matrix
format and access pattern in the first input (A) matrix. We find that
hierarchical clustering can speed up SpGEMM by 1.39x on average with low
preprocessing cost (less than 20x the cost of a single SpGEMM on about 90% of
inputs). Furthermore, we decouple the reordering algorithm from the clustered
matrix format so they can be applied as independent optimizations.
  Additionally, this paper sheds light on the role of both row reordering and
clustering independently and together for SpGEMM with a comprehensive empirical
study of the effect of 10 different reordering algorithms and 3 clustering
schemes on SpGEMM performance on a suite of 110 matrices. We find that
reordering based on graph partitioning provides better SpGEMM performance than
existing alternatives at the cost of high preprocessing time. The evaluation
demonstrates that the proposed hierarchical clustering method achieves greater
average speedup compared to other reordering schemes with similar preprocessing
times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为实验提供资源管理的GlideinWMS需要更高效的开发和测试方法，同时简化新成员培训和实际体验。

Method: 构建基于容器的工作空间，包括核心容器（计算节点、批处理系统、工厂、调度器等），并评估不同容器运行时的性能与易用性。

Result: 工作空间支持快速开发、离线测试，并成功用于培训和实际工作坊，提升了开发效率和团队协作。

Conclusion: GlideinWMS工作空间显著简化了开发流程和团队培训，为大规模作业管理提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: GlideinWMS is a workload manager provisioning resources for many experiments,
including CMS and DUNE. The software is distributed both as native packages and
specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other
communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like
containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source
tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to
see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what
differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base
system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute
element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a
scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional
containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a
laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with
an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our
experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are
easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing
development and testing of the system even when offline. They simplified the
training and onboarding of new team members and summer interns. And they were
useful in workshops where students could have first-hand experience with the
mechanisms and components that, in production, run millions of jobs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择合适的资源可以加速任务完成、提高硬件利用率并降低成本，但基准测试过程繁琐耗时。

Method: 利用GlideinWMS的pilot基础设施开发GlideinBenchmark，自动化执行基准测试，并通过HEPCloud的Decision Engine优化资源分配。

Conclusion: GlideinBenchmark通过自动化基准测试和资源优化，显著提升了效率和成本效益。

Abstract: Choosing the right resource can speed up job completion, better utilize the
available hardware, and visibly reduce costs, especially when renting computers
in the cloud. This was demonstrated in earlier studies on HEPCloud. However,
the benchmarking of the resources proved to be a laborious and time-consuming
process. This paper presents GlideinBenchmark, a new Web application leveraging
the pilot infrastructure of GlideinWMS to benchmark resources, and it shows how
to use the data collected and published by GlideinBenchmark to automate the
optimal selection of resources. An experiment can select the benchmark or the
set of benchmarks that most closely evaluate the performance of its workflows.
GlideinBenchmark, with the help of the GlideinWMS Factory, controls the
benchmark execution. Finally, a scheduler like HEPCloud's Decision Engine can
use the results to optimize resource provisioning.

*Yicong Luo,Senhe Hao,Brian Wheatman,Prashant Pandey,Helen Xu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种并发B-skiplist，通过优化缓存局部性提升性能，同时保持传统skiplist的简单性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统skiplist因单节点存储单元素导致缓存局部性差，影响性能。优化缓存局部性是提升内存索引性能的关键。

Method: 提出了一种自上而下的单次插入算法及对应的并发控制方案。

Result: 在128线程下，B-skiplist的吞吐量比现有并发skiplist高2x-9x，与树状索引相比也有竞争力（0.9x-1.7x）。99%延迟显著低于其他方案。

Conclusion: B-skiplist在性能和延迟上均优于现有并发skiplist和树状索引，同时保持了简单性。

Abstract: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores,
such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple
concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor
cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving
performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to
maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.
In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache
locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional
skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions
include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a
corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128
threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher
throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations,
including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java
ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves
competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to
state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a
more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of
skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between
3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between
0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads
with inserts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为协作状态机（CSM）的编程模型，用于解决Cloud-Edge-IoT应用中动态和状态管理的复杂性。CSM通过事件驱动和状态封装，支持跨层分布的应用开发，并在多个用例中展示了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编程模型难以有效管理Cloud-Edge-IoT应用的动态和状态特性，因此需要一种更强大的模型来支持这类应用的开发。

Method: 论文提出了协作状态机（CSM）模型，支持事件驱动、状态封装和跨层协作，并开发了运行时系统进行实现。

Result: 在三个用例中，CSM表现出显著的性能提升：压力测试吞吐量提升12倍，监控系统处理时间减少2.3倍，智能工厂总处理时间减少55倍。

Conclusion: CSM是一种高效的编程模型，能够显著提升Cloud-Edge-IoT应用的性能和生产力。

Abstract: The development of Cloud-Edge-IoT applications requires robust programming
models. Existing models often struggle to manage the dynamic and stateful
nature of these applications effectively. This paper introduces the
Collaborative State Machines (CSM) programming model to address these
complexities. CSM facilitates the development of reactive, event-driven, and
stateful applications targeting the Cloud-Edge-IoT continuum. Applications
built with CSM are composed of state machines that collaborate autonomously and
can be distributed across different layers of the continuum. Key features of
CSM include (i) a sophisticated collaboration mechanism among state machines
utilizing events and persistent data; (ii) encapsulation of state through the
inherent state of state machines and persistent data; (iii) integration of
actions and service invocations within states and state transitions, thereby
decoupling complex application logic from compute and data processing services;
and (iv) an advanced data model that supports the processing of local, static,
and persistent data with defined scope and lifetime. In addition to introducing
the CSM programming model, we present a runtime system and a comprehensive
evaluation of our approach. This evaluation is based on three use cases: a
stress test on a large-scale infrastructure, a surveillance system application,
and a complex smart factory scenario, all deployed on the Grid'5000 testbed.
Our results demonstrate a 12x increase in throughput through novel language
features in the stress test. Compared to Serverless Workflow, a
state-of-the-art baseline system, we show a 2.3x improvement in processing time
per processed image in a surveillance system use case, a 55x reduction in total
processing time for a smart factory use case, and an overall improvement in
productivity across these use cases.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文评估了两种低同步成本的BCGS变体（BCGSI+P-1S和BCGSI+P-2S）在分布式内存系统中的性能，发现其相比经典算法（BCGSI+）分别实现了4倍和2倍的加速，且稳定性优于其他低同步变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模分布式内存问题中，全局同步成本是性能瓶颈，因此需要低同步且稳定的正交化算法。

Method: 通过数值实验比较BCGSI+P-1S、BCGSI+P-2S与其他低同步BCGS变体的性能。

Result: BCGSI+P-1S和BCGSI+P-2S分别实现了4倍和2倍的加速，且稳定性优于同类算法。

Conclusion: BCGSI+P-1S和BCGSI+P-2S因其高稳定性和低同步成本，成为分布式内存系统中QR分解的最佳选择。

Abstract: Numerous applications, such as Krylov subspace solvers, make extensive use of
the block classical Gram-Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized
variants for orthogonalizing a set of vectors. For large-scale problems in
distributed memory settings, the communication cost, particularly the global
synchronization cost, is a major performance bottleneck. In recent years, many
low-synchronization BCGS variants have been proposed in an effort to reduce the
number of synchronization points. The work [E. Carson, Y. Ma, arXiv preprint
2411.07077] recently proposed stable one-synchronization and
two-synchronization variants of BCGS, i.e., BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S. In this
work, we evaluate the performance of BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S on a distributed
memory system compared to other well-known low-synchronization BCGS variants.
In comparison to the classical reorthogonalized BCGS algorithm (BCGSI+),
numerical experiments demonstrate that BCGSI+P-1S and BCGSI+P-2S can achieve up
to 4 times and 2 times speedups, respectively, and perform similarly to other
(less stable) one-synchronization and two-synchronization variants. BCGSI+P-1S
and BCGSI+P-2S are therefore recommended as the best choice in practice for
computing an economic QR factorization on distributed memory systems due to
their superior stability when compared to other variants with the same
synchronization cost.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文研究了5G网络中Cell DTX/DRX的优化配置，通过深度强化学习平衡节能与数据包延迟，实现最高45%的节能效果且服务质量（QoS）下降不超过1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中Cell DTX/DRX是一种重要的节能技术，但会增加数据包延迟。如何在节能和服务质量之间找到最优配置是一个复杂问题。

Method: 采用深度强化学习（DRL）框架，结合深度Q网络（DQN）和上下文赌博机（CB）模型，设计平滑的奖励函数来训练AI代理。

Result: 仿真结果显示，AI代理在不同网络和流量条件下能实现最高45%的节能效果，且QoS下降不超过1%。

Conclusion: 通过DRL框架，Cell DTX/DRX的优化配置能够在保证服务质量的同时显著提升节能效果。

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

Main category: cs.NI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络向多供应商解决方案发展，准确建模EDFA的增益谱对优化光网络性能至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：无监督预训练（噪声增强测量）和监督微调（自定义加权MSE损失），并结合迁移学习技术实现同质和异质模型适配。

Result: 在26个EDFA上的实验表明，该方法显著减少了测量需求，同时实现了更低的平均绝对误差和更好的误差分布。

Conclusion: 所提出的SS-NN模型在增益谱预测中表现出色，适用于多种EDFA类型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

Motivation: 解决移动设备上ML应用因资源受限和平台兼容性问题导致的部署挑战。

Method: 引入记录/重放机制和Operator Sequence Search算法，消除重复RPC调用。

Result: 延迟和能耗降低98%，性能接近非透明方法，无需修改源代码。

Conclusion: RRTO在MEC推理中实现了高性能透明卸载，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Deploying Machine Learning (ML) applications on resource-constrained mobile
devices remains challenging due to limited computational resources and poor
platform compatibility. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers
offloading-based inference paradigm using GPU servers, existing approaches are
divided into non-transparent and transparent methods, with the latter
necessitating modifications to the source code. Non-transparent offloading
achieves high performance but requires intrusive code modification, limiting
compatibility with diverse applications. Transparent offloading, in contrast,
offers wide compatibility but introduces significant transmission delays due to
per-operator remote procedure calls (RPCs). To overcome this limitation, we
propose RRTO, the first high-performance transparent offloading system tailored
for MEC inference. RRTO introduces a record/replay mechanism that leverages the
static operator sequence in ML models to eliminate repetitive RPCs. To reliably
identify this sequence, RRTO integrates a novel Operator Sequence Search
algorithm that detects repeated patterns, filters initialization noise, and
accelerates matching via a two-level strategy. Evaluation demonstrates that
RRTO achieves substantial reductions of up to 98% in both per-inference latency
and energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art transparent methods and
yields results comparable to non-transparent approaches, all without
necessitating any source code modification.

Motivation: 研究高阶引用在终止性语言中的作用，澄清Landin's Knot的误解，探索如何安全地添加高阶引用。

Method: 使用闭包转换语言，明确函数环境并通过非直谓量化隐藏环境类型，展示如何利用量化编码递归。

Result: 发现高阶引用本身不导致非终止性，关键在于无限制的环境量化。限制量化可安全添加高阶引用。

Conclusion: 限制对函数环境的量化可以安全地在终止性语言中添加高阶引用，无需复杂类型系统或限制函数存储。

Abstract: In this work, we explore Landin's Knot, which is understood as a pattern for
encoding general recursion, including non-termination, that is possible after
adding higher-order references to an otherwise terminating language. We observe
that this isn't always true -- higher-order references, by themselves, don't
lead to non-termination. The key insight is that Landin's Knot relies not
primarily on references storing functions, but on unrestricted quantification
over a function's environment. We show this through a closure converted
language, in which the function's environment is made explicit and hides the
type of the environment through impredicative quantification. Once references
are added, this impredicative quantification can be exploited to encode
recursion. We conjecture that by restricting the quantification over the
environment, higher-order references can be safely added to terminating
languages, without resorting to more complex type systems such as linearity,
and without restricting references from storing functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编程范式缺乏对固定点计算的直接支持，导致实现低效且易出错。

Method: FPOP通过结构化推理规则和用户导向优化，提供高级抽象，使开发者能编写声明式规范。

Result: FPOP显著简化算法实现，提升可维护性，并支持快速原型设计，例如图距离问题仅需两行代码。

Conclusion: FPOP填补了理论固定点公式与实际实现之间的鸿沟，有望推动进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Fixed-Point-Oriented Programming (FPOP) is an emerging paradigm designed to
streamline the implementation of problems involving self-referential
computations. These include graph algorithms, static analysis, parsing, and
distributed computing-domains that traditionally require complex and
tricky-to-implement work-queue algorithms. Existing programming paradigms lack
direct support for these inherently fixed-point computations, leading to
inefficient and error-prone implementations.
  This white paper explores the potential of the FPOP paradigm, which offers a
high-level abstraction that enables concise and expressive problem
formulations. By leveraging structured inference rules and user-directed
optimizations, FPOP allows developers to write declarative specifications while
the compiler ensures efficient execution. It not only reduces implementation
complexity for programmers but also enhances adaptability, making it easier for
programmers to explore alternative solutions and optimizations without
modifying the core logic of their program.
  We demonstrate how FPOP simplifies algorithm implementation, improves
maintainability, and enables rapid prototyping by allowing problems to be
clearly and concisely expressed. For example, the graph distance problem can be
expressed in only two executable lines of code with FPOP, while it takes an
order of magnitude more code in other paradigms. By bridging the gap between
theoretical fixed-point formulations and practical implementations, we aim to
foster further research and adoption of this paradigm.

Motivation: 解决LLM集成脚本中模块化与性能的挑战，避免脚本与特定LLM实现耦合及并行化机会的浪费。

Method: 采用可组合效应处理技术，将效应操作抽象为接口并通过效应处理器实现，分离工作流逻辑。

Result: 在Tree-of-Thoughts案例中实现10倍加速，同时保持模块化。

Conclusion: 提倡可组合效应处理作为LLM脚本编程风格，平衡模块化与性能。

Abstract: Implementing LLM-integrated scripts introduces challenges in modularity and
performance, as scripts are often coupled to specific LLM implementations and
fail to exploit parallelization opportunities. This paper proposes using
composable effect handling to separate workflow logic from effectful
operations, such as LLM calls, I/O, and concurrency, enabling modularity
without sacrificing the opportunity for performance optimization. By treating
these operations as abstract interfaces and discharging them via effect
handlers, this paper shows that scripts can achieve significant speedups (e.g.,
10$\times$ in a Tree-of-Thoughts case study) without compromising modularity.
This paper aims to promote composable effect handling as a programming style
for LLM scripting.

Motivation: 现代AI应用处理结构化数据时，现有工具生成的输入常无效且效率低，缺乏通用性。

Abstract: [Context] Modern AI applications increasingly process highly structured data,
such as 3D meshes and point clouds, where test input generation must preserve
both structural and semantic validity. However, existing fuzzing tools and
input generators are typically handcrafted for specific input types and often
generate invalid inputs that are subsequently discarded, leading to
inefficiency and poor generalizability. [Objective] This study investigates
whether test inputs for structured domains can be unified through a graph-based
representation, enabling general, reusable mutation strategies while enforcing
structural constraints. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in
enhancing input validity and semantic preservation across eight AI systems.
[Method] We develop and evaluate GRAphRef, a graph-based test input generation
framework that supports constraint-based mutation and refinement. GRAphRef maps
structured inputs to graphs, applies neighbor-similarity-guided mutations, and
uses a constraint-refinement phase to repair invalid inputs. We will conduct a
confirmatory study across eight real-world mesh-processing AI systems,
comparing GRAphRef with AFL, MeshAttack, Saffron, and two ablated variants.
Evaluation metrics include structural validity, semantic preservation (via
prediction consistency), and performance overhead. Experimental data is derived
from ShapeNetCore mesh seeds and model outputs from systems like MeshCNN and
HodgeNet. Statistical analysis and component latency breakdowns will be used to
assess each hypothesis.

TL;DR: 研究发现，开发者对生成式AI工具的采用不均，主要源于对工具的认知、使用方式和应对挑战的态度差异。组织对快速生产力提升的期望未辅以足够学习支持，导致“生产力压力悖论”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开发者对生成式AI工具采用不均的原因及其对生产力和开发者角色的影响。

Method: 通过对27个团队的54名开发者进行配对访谈（每团队一名频繁使用者和一名不频繁使用者），分析使用差异的根源。

Result: 使用差异主要源于开发者对工具的认知（协作者vs.功能）、使用方式（实验性vs.保守）和应对挑战的态度（适应性坚持vs.快速放弃）。

Conclusion: 组织需平衡生产力期望与学习支持，避免“生产力压力悖论”阻碍工具的实际效益。

Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of generative AI tools in software
engineering, developer adoption remains uneven. This unevenness is problematic
because it hampers productivity efforts, frustrates management's expectations,
and creates uncertainty around the future roles of developers. Through paired
interviews with 54 developers across 27 teams -- one frequent and one
infrequent user per team -- we demonstrate that differences in usage result
primarily from how developers perceive the tool (as a collaborator vs.
feature), their engagement approach (experimental vs. conservative), and how
they respond when encountering challenges (with adaptive persistence vs. quick
abandonment). Our findings imply that widespread organizational expectations
for rapid productivity gains without sufficient investment in learning support
creates a "Productivity Pressure Paradox," undermining the very productivity
benefits that motivate adoption.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于模型的方法，通过训练预测模型来放大并发系统中难以复现的Bug的出现概率，显著优于随机采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并发系统中的Bug往往在罕见条件下出现，难以复现，需要一种系统化的方法来提高其出现概率。

Method: 将系统视为黑盒，通过重复试验训练预测模型，估计输入配置触发Bug的概率，并比较多种模型搜索技术。

Result: 在17种代表性并发Bug上评估，模型方法显著提高Bug出现率，通常比随机采样高一个数量级。

Conclusion: 模型引导的搜索方法能有效放大Bug出现概率，为非侵入式测试框架提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Bugs, especially those in concurrent systems, are often hard to reproduce
because they manifest only under rare conditions. Testers frequently encounter
failures that occur only under specific inputs, even when occurring with low
probability. We propose an approach to systematically amplify the occurrence of
such elusive bugs. We treat the system under test as a black-box and use
repeated trial executions to train a predictive model that estimates the
probability of a given input configuration triggering a bug. We evaluate this
approach on a dataset of 17 representative concurrency bugs spanning diverse
categories. Several model-based search techniques are compared against a
brute-force random sampling baseline. Our results show that an ensemble of
regression models can significantly increase bug occurrence rates across nearly
all scenarios, often achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement over random
sampling. The contributions of this work include: (i) a novel formulation of
bug-amplification as a rare-event regression problem; (ii) an empirical
evaluation of multiple techniques for amplifying bug occurrence, demonstrating
the effectiveness of model-guided search; and (iii) a practical, non-invasive
testing framework that helps practitioners expose hidden concurrency faults
without altering the internal system architecture.

### [240] [Does Editing Improve Answer Quality on Stack Overflow? A Data-Driven Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21329)
*Saikat Mondal,Chanchal K. Roy*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了Stack Overflow上Python相关答案的编辑效果，发现编辑对答案质量的影响不一致，既有正面也有负面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 技术问答平台的高质量答案对软件开发至关重要，但编辑对质量的影响尚未系统评估。

Method: 分析了94,994条至少有一次被接受编辑的Python相关答案，评估编辑对语义相关性、代码可用性等六个质量维度的影响。

Result: 53.3%的编辑提高了语义相关性，但38.1%降低了相关性；9%的代码从不可执行变为可执行，14.7%的代码变为不可解析；32.3%的编辑增加了代码复杂性；20.5%的编辑引入了安全问题；51.0%的编辑优化了性能，但执行时间总体增加；49.7%的编辑降低了可读性。

Conclusion: 编辑效果不一致，可能影响软件的可维护性、安全性和效率，需引起用户和管理员的注意，并为协作编辑系统的改进提供参考。

Abstract: High-quality answers in technical Q&A platforms like Stack Overflow (SO) are
crucial as they directly influence software development practices. Poor-quality
answers can introduce inefficiencies, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, and
thus increase maintenance costs and technical debt in production software. To
improve content quality, SO allows collaborative editing, where users revise
answers to enhance clarity, correctness, and formatting. Several studies have
examined rejected edits and identified the causes of rejection. However, prior
research has not systematically assessed whether accepted edits enhance key
quality dimensions. While one study investigated the impact of edits on C/C++
vulnerabilities, broader quality aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we
analyze 94,994 Python-related answers that have at least one accepted edit to
determine whether edits improve (1) semantic relevance, (2) code usability, (3)
code complexity, (4) security vulnerabilities, (5) code optimization, and (6)
readability. Our findings show both positive and negative effects of edits.
While 53.3% of edits improve how well answers match questions, 38.1% make them
less relevant. Some previously broken code (9%) becomes executable, yet working
code (14.7%) turns non-parsable after edits. Many edits increase complexity
(32.3%), making code harder to maintain. Instead of fixing security issues,
20.5% of edits introduce additional issues. Even though 51.0% of edits optimize
performance, execution time still increases overall. Readability also suffers,
as 49.7% of edits make code harder to read. This study highlights the
inconsistencies in editing outcomes and provides insights into how edits impact
software maintainability, security, and efficiency that might caution users and
moderators and help future improvements in collaborative editing systems.

TL;DR: MAAD是一个基于多智能体系统的自动化软件架构设计框架，通过四个专业代理协作生成架构蓝图和评估报告，优于现有基线，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件架构设计依赖人工，耗时且设计选择有限，尤其在敏捷开发中。LLM在软件工程任务中表现优异，但在架构设计中的应用仍需探索。

Method: MAAD框架使用四个代理（分析师、建模师、设计者和评估者）协作处理需求规范，生成架构蓝图和基于质量属性的评估报告。

Result: MAAD在生成全面架构组件和结构化评估报告方面优于MetaGPT，工业界反馈验证了其实用性。GPT-4o在三种LLM中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MAAD为自动化架构设计提供了高效解决方案，强调了LLM选择的重要性，并展示了多智能体协作的潜力。

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

Motivation: LLM在软件和测试开发中的应用日益增多，但缺乏全面且自主的验证方法，且存在幻觉问题，导致对其结果的信任度不足。

Method: 采用双LLM系统（生成型和判别型），实验了不同参数规模的LLM，并使用十种精心选择的指标进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在生成高质量编译器测试和自动验证方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 双LLM系统能有效解决LLM生成代码的验证问题，提升其应用价值。

Abstract: The usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) for software and test development
has continued to increase since LLMs were first introduced, but only recently
have the expectations of LLMs become more realistic. Verifying the correctness
of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have
been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet.
Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems
without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to
explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their
results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply
LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a
discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation
of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs
possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten
carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through
our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to
generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.

TL;DR: HLSDebugger是一种针对HLS逻辑调试的定制解决方案，通过生成大规模标注数据集和采用编码器-解码器结构，显著提升了调试效率，性能优于GPT-4等先进LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HLS调试对缺乏硬件领域知识的设计师或软件工程师来说是一项挑战，而现有LLM在应用于HLS逻辑调试时面临数据稀缺、逻辑复杂性高和多任务需求等关键问题。

Method: HLSDebugger生成并发布了一个包含30万样本的标注数据集，采用编码器-解码器结构，同时执行错误定位、类型预测和修正。

Result: HLSDebugger在错误识别和修正上显著优于GPT-4，修正性能提升超过3倍。

Conclusion: HLSDebugger为HLS代码的自动化调试提供了重要进展。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

Result: 开发了一种分类方法，能够评估开源项目中非代码贡献的伦理行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为开源社区提供了一种自动化工具，以监控和促进伦理行为，从而提升项目的可持续性和协作环境。

Abstract: The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) is not only a technical
challenge, but also a social one due to the diverse mixture of contributors. To
this aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure
needed to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the
community's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as
issues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing
contributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process
faces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.
To foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly
deploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and
inclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the
main model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct
is a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this
paper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding
contributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a
promising technology for text classification tasks. We defined a set of ethical
metrics based on the Contributor Covenant and developed a classification
approach to assess ethical behavior in OSS non-coding contributions, using
prompt engineering to guide the model's output.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件维护风险对软件供应链的质量、安全和韧性构成威胁，现有方法存在定义模糊、可解释性不足和数据规模有限的问题。

Method: 引入‘维护停止’概念，构建包含115,466个GitHub仓库的大规模数据集，提出多视角特征框架（用户、维护者和项目演化特征），并采用AFT生存分析和SHAP分析。

Result: AFT生存分析的C指数达0.846，显著优于仅依赖表面特征的模型，特征消融和SHAP分析验证了方法的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究为开源生态系统提供了一种可扩展、可解释的维护风险预测方法，并在openEuler生态系统中验证了实际应用价值。

Abstract: The maintenance risks of open source software (OSS) projects pose significant
threats to the quality, security, and resilience of modern software supply
chains. While prior research has proposed diverse approaches for predicting OSS
maintenance risk -- leveraging signals ranging from surface features (e.g.,
stars, commits) to social network analyses and behavioral patterns -- existing
methods often suffer from ambiguous operational definitions, limited
interpretability, and datasets of insufficient scale or generalizability. In
this work, we introduce ``maintenance cessation'', grounded in both explicit
archival status and rigorous semantic analysis of project documentation.
Building on this foundation, we curate a large-scale, longitudinal dataset of
115,466 GitHub repositories -- encompassing 57,733 confirmed cessation events
-- complemented by comprehensive, timeline-based behavioral features. We
propose an integrated, multi-perspective feature framework for predicting
maintenance cessation, systematically combining user-centric features,
maintainer-centric features and project evolution features. AFT survival
analysis demonstrates a high C-index (0.846), substantially outperforming
models relying only on surface features. Feature ablation and SHAP analysis
further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by deploying a GBSA classifier
in the openEuler ecosystem for proactive package risk screening. Our work
establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for maintenance-risk
prediction, enabling reproducible risk management across large-scale open
source ecosystems.

Result: MultiAIGCD数据集包含多种语言和场景的代码样本，并测试了三种检测模型在跨模型和跨语言场景中的表现。

Conclusion: MultiAIGCD为AI生成代码检测研究提供了支持，并公开了数据集和代码以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

Method: 通过意图视角和历史分析，定义vibe coding为人类与生成式AI通过自然语言对话协作的软件开发范式。

Conclusion: 提出了涵盖人类、技术和组织的研究议程，以指导未来对这一范式的探索。

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

TL;DR: DeepGo是一种预测性定向灰盒模糊测试工具，结合历史和预测信息，通过最优路径引导模糊测试到达目标站点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定向灰盒模糊测试（DGF）技术依赖启发式算法优化适应度指标，缺乏对未执行路径的预见性，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出路径转移模型，利用深度神经网络构建虚拟集成环境（VEE）预测路径转移及其奖励，并通过强化学习模型（RLF）生成最优路径转移序列。

Result: DeepGo能够高效到达目标站点，克服复杂约束路径的障碍。

Conclusion: DeepGo通过结合预测和历史信息，显著提升了定向灰盒模糊测试的效率和精准度。

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了预训练代码语言模型（CodeLMs）在检测跨语言错误（CLBs）中的潜力，开发了工具CLCFinder并构建了数据集，结果显示微调后模型性能提升，但不同模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言编程中跨语言错误（CLBs）难以检测，现有单语言工具无法有效解决，因此研究CodeLMs在CLB检测中的应用。

Method: 开发CLCFinder工具，构建包含三种编程语言组合的CLB数据集，微调13种CodeLMs并评估性能，分析数据集大小、代码注释等因素的影响。

Result: 微调前CodeLMs表现差，微调后性能提升，UniXcoder-base表现最佳（F1=0.7407）。小模型表现优于大模型，单语言数据集微调的模型对CLB检测效果差。

Conclusion: CodeLMs在CLB检测中具有潜力，但需针对性微调；数据集大小是关键因素，而代码注释的影响因模型而异。

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多项Logit模型（MNL）中的辅助作用，通过实验评估了六种主流LLM的表现，发现专有模型在结构化提示下表现最佳，而开源模型表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多个领域广泛应用，但其在离散选择模型中的应用尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估LLMs在模型规范和估计中的潜力。

Method: 研究设计了五个实验配置，涉及13个版本的六种LLM（如ChatGPT、Claude等），评估其在模型建议、估计、提示策略和信息可用性方面的表现。

Result: 专有LLM（如Claude 4 Sonnet和GPT）在生成有效且行为合理的模型规范方面表现优异，而开源模型（如Llama和Gemma）表现不佳。部分LLM在仅提供数据字典时表现更好。

Conclusion: LLMs在离散选择模型中展现出潜力，尤其在模型规范和决策支持方面，但仍存在局限性，需进一步研究以优化其应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows
across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains
relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive
agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of
Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework
involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.
These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting
vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.
Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data
dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,
and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and
model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and
behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by
structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to
produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the
best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with
robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided
with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance
internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of
correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.
Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of
LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification
but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide
practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'
workflows.

*Luigi Garzon,Vitor Possebom*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 论文研究了异质性和非线性处理效应在具有外生份额的shift-share设计中的应用，提出了一种三角模型和控制函数方法，识别了四个目标参数，并应用于评估中国进口对美国制造业就业的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索shift-share设计中未被捕捉的异质性处理效应，并改进现有工具。

Method: 采用三角模型和控制函数校正处理内生性，提出灵活的参数估计方法。

Result: 结果显示显著的异质性处理效应，现有shift-share工具未能捕捉。

Conclusion: 结论表明新方法能有效识别和处理异质性效应，为政策相关分析提供更准确依据。

Abstract: We analyze heterogenous, nonlinear treatment effects in shift-share designs
with exogenous shares. We employ a triangular model and correct for treatment
endogeneity using a control function. Our tools identify four target
parameters. Two of them capture the observable heterogeneity of treatment
effects, while one summarizes this heterogeneity in a single measure. The last
parameter analyzes counterfactual, policy-relevant treatment assignment
mechanisms. We propose flexible parametric estimators for these parameters and
apply them to reevaluate the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. manufacturing
employment. Our results highlight substantial treatment effect heterogeneity,
which is not captured by commonly used shift-share tools.

TL;DR: 本文评估了美国牛肉行业中‘一价定律’的有效性，发现部分地区部分符合，但全国范围内价格趋同仍难以实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究美国牛肉市场区域价格动态的因果关系，验证‘一价定律’的适用性。

Method: 通过计量经济学测试分析区域价格序列的整合性和因果关系。

Result: 东北部和西部地区部分符合‘一价定律’，但全国范围内价格趋同未实现；南部价格对外部冲击敏感。

Conclusion: 美国牛肉市场存在结构性摩擦，阻碍了完全的市场统一。

Abstract: The United States, a leading global producer and consumer of beef, continues
to face substantial challenges in achieving price harmonization across its
regional markets. This paper evaluates the validity of the Law of One Price
(LOP) in the U.S. beef industry and investigates causal relationships among
regional price dynamics. Through a series of econometric tests, we establish
that regional price series are integrated of order one, displaying
non-stationarity in levels and stationarity in first differences. The analysis
reveals partial LOP compliance in the Northeast and West, while full
convergence remains elusive at the national level. Although no region
demonstrates persistent price leadership, Southern prices appear particularly
sensitive to exogenous shocks. These findings reflect asymmetrical integration
across U.S. beef markets and suggest the presence of structural frictions that
hinder complete market unification.

### [253] [Cash and Cognition: The Impact of Transfer Timing on Standardized Test Performance and Human Capital](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21393)
*Axel Eizmendi Larrinaga,Germán Reyes*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究发现，低收入家庭获得货币转移的时间会影响学生在高利害标准化考试中的认知表现，尤其是在考试前几天获得转移的学生成绩更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨货币转移的时间安排如何影响学生的考试表现及其长期人力资本积累。

Method: 结合全球最大的有条件现金转移计划的行政记录和18.5万名受益家庭高中生的大学入学考试成绩，利用支付日期的随机变化进行分析。

Result: 考试前几天获得转移的学生成绩提高0.01个标准差，且对较大金额的接受者影响更显著，长期来看提高了大学入学率和毕业率。

Conclusion: 短期流动性约束在高利害事件中具有长期影响，优化支付时间可提升社会项目的效果。

Abstract: This paper shows that the timing of monetary transfers to low-income families
affects students' cognitive performance on high-stakes standardized tests. We
combine administrative records from the world's largest conditional cash
transfer program with college admission exam results of 185,000 high school
students from beneficiary families. Exploiting random variation in payment
dates, we find that receiving the transfer in the days preceding the exam
increases test scores by 0.01 standard deviations relative to receiving it the
subsequent week. Question-level analysis reveals that effects are concentrated
in final questions and easier questions, suggesting improved cognitive
endurance and effort allocation. The impacts are largest for recipients of
larger transfers, who experience persistent gains in human capital
accumulation: their college enrollment increases by 0.6 percentage points, with
higher graduation and formal employment rates seven years later. Our findings
show that short-term liquidity constraints during high-stakes events can have
long-lasting implications, and suggest opportunities to improve social programs
through improved payment scheduling.

*Valerio De Stefano,Maddalena Mula,Manuel Sebastian Mariani,Andrea Zaccaria*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文研究了企业出口多样化与未来绩效的关系，发现出口高附加值产品的企业增长更快，而核心生产领域外的多样化对增长有积极影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索企业出口产品的特性如何预测其未来绩效，填补了现有理论在预测企业增长方面的不足。

Method: 基于经济复杂性理论和企业增长文献，分析了12,852家意大利企业的出口和财务数据，引入了新的多样化衡量指标。

Result: 出口高附加值产品的企业增长更快；核心领域外的多样化促进增长，而核心领域内的多样化则抑制增长。

Conclusion: 企业增长不仅取决于出口产品的数量，还取决于这些产品在生产生态系统中的位置。

Abstract: A rich theoretical and empirical literature investigated the link between
export diversification and firm performance. Prior theoretical works hinted at
the key role of capability accumulation in shaping production activities and
performance, without however producing product-level indicators able to
forecast corporate growth. Building on economic complexity theory and the
corporate growth literature, this paper examines which characteristics of a
firm's export basket predict future performance. We analyze a unique
longitudinal dataset that covers export and financial data for 12,852 Italian
firms. We find that firms exporting products typically exported by wealthier
countries -- a proxy for greater product sophistication and market value --
tend to experience higher growth and profit per employee. Moreover, we find
that diversification outside of a firm's core production area is positively
associated with future growth, whereas diversification within the core is
negatively associated. This is revealed by introducing novel measures of
in-block and out-of-block diversification, based on algorithmically-detected
production blocks. Our findings suggest that growth is driven not just by how
many products a firm exports, but also by where these products lie within the
production ecosystem, at both local and global scales.

### [255] [Markowitz Variance May Vastly Undervalue or Overestimate Portfolio Variance and Risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21824)
*Victor Olkhov*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了投资者如何通过观察市场交易数据来估算其未交易投资组合的回报、方差和风险，提出了基于市场交易量的方差模型，并指出传统Markowitz方差模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Markowitz方差模型假设交易量恒定，而实际市场中交易量波动显著。本文旨在提出一种更准确的基于市场交易量的方差模型，以改进投资组合风险评估。

Method: 通过分析连续交易的时间序列，将投资组合视为单一证券，推导出基于市场交易量的方差模型，并利用泰勒展开式量化交易量波动对方差的影响。

Result: 研究表明，交易量波动系数对市场方差有显著影响，可能导致Markowitz模型低估或高估风险。

Conclusion: 投资者和机构应使用基于市场交易量的方差模型，以更准确地评估风险并优化投资组合。

Abstract: We consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of his portfolio. The
investor only observes the current trades made in the market with his
securities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged
portfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market
with the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model
the trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the
equal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the
portfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the
volumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance
describes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades
with securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the
coefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize
this dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we
derive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the
coefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We
consider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio
returns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that
the impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can
cause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the
market-based variance of the portfolio. Incorrect assessments of the variances
of securities and of the portfolio cause wrong risk estimates, disturb optimal
portfolio selection, and result in unexpected losses. The major investors,
portfolio managers, and developers of macroeconomic models like BlackRock, JP
Morgan, and the U.S. Fed should use market-based variance to adjust their
predictions to the randomness of market trades.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文研究了委员会在决定是否通过一项未知效益政策时的最优投票机制，指出“最苛刻成员独裁”是最优机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何设计投票机制，以在信息获取成本高且存在游说者干扰的情况下，最大化政策决策的准确性。

Method: 分析不同投票机制对政策决策的影响，比较信息获取成本和决策质量。

Result: 发现“最苛刻成员独裁”机制在提高好政策通过率、降低坏政策通过率及减少成员信息获取成本方面优于其他机制。

Conclusion: “最苛刻成员独裁”是委员会决策的最优投票机制。

Abstract: I study the optimal voting mechanism for a committee that must decide whether
to enact or block a policy of unknown benefit. Information can come both from
committee members who can acquire it at cost, and a strategic lobbyist who
wishes the policy to be enacted. I show that the dictatorship of the
most-demanding member is a dominant voting mechanism: any other voting
mechanism is (i) less likely to enact a good policy, (ii) more likely to enact
a bad policy, and (iii) burdens every member with a greater cost of acquiring
information.

Practical distributed protocols make\nminimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a\npartially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we\nargue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong\nsynchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous\nlock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design\nthat uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,\nand loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging\nour engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication\nprotocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently\npipeline multiple replication instances, while allowing all replicas to propose\nin parallel without extra coordination. Through experiments, we show that Chora\nachieves 255% and 109% improvement in throughput over state-of-the-art\nsingle-leader and multi-leader protocols, respectively."}

In microservice systems, as the number of services\nand the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as\ncomputing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To\naddress this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on\nreinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the\nenvironment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the\nexperiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load\nscenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including\nresponse time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The\nexperimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling\nmethod significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low\nload and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource\nutilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource\nconditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve\noptimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource\nallocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger\nadaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation\nstrategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in\ndynamically changing load and resource environments."}

It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no\nrational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce\nauxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal\ndiscounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve\nmathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually\nperceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative\napproach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse\npartitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are\ngrouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a\nrepresentative element of its group before being added. This method allows for\na phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a\nbehavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as\na definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a\nplausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might\nhandle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg\nseries can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed\npartition.

In this paper we introduce\nfirst-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD\nwith little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three\nloosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code\ntransformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward\nlifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order\narray language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end\ncompilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable\naspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for\nhigher-order code.\n  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a\ncarefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and\n'scatter'.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results.

We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains."}

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior.

To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols.

Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

Our approach learns explicit multi-level\nrepresentations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the\nscalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a\nsplit-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for\nefficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our\nsplit-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for\nlearning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared\nto conventional single-GPU execution."}

To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture.

Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner.

Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use."}

The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most\nsystems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual\nencoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them\nincorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking.

To address this gap, we conducted a detailed\nsurvey of LLM4AIOps, focusing on how LLMs can optimize processes and improve\noutcomes in this domain. We analyzed 183 research papers published between\nJanuary 2020 and December 2024 to answer four key research questions (RQs). In\nRQ1, we examine the diverse failure data sources utilized, including advanced\nLLM-based processing techniques for legacy data and the incorporation of new\ndata sources enabled by LLMs. RQ2 explores the evolution of AIOps tasks,\nhighlighting the emergence of novel tasks and the publication trends across\nthese tasks. RQ3 investigates the various LLM-based methods applied to address\nAIOps challenges. Finally, RQ4 reviews evaluation methodologies tailored to\nassess LLM-integrated AIOps approaches. Based on our findings, we discuss the\nstate-of-the-art advancements and trends, identify gaps in existing research,\nand propose promising directions for future exploration."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions.

As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,\ncreating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos\nwith generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we\nachieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,\nand we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification\nlayer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we\ncompiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced\nby 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling\nover 7 hours of video content.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively.

VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use."}

However, we observe that most real-world\nscenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the\nperformance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models\nstill perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4\nresolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with\ndifferent resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression,\nnamely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides\nwhether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output\na special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing\nEfficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or\nthresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by\ncase. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding\ncapability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens\non simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge\nstrategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully\ndesign a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and\nreasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink."}

To generate data via a flow matching model, an\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward\nintegration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality\nthat is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was\nrecently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically\nintegrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the\nmulti-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of\nmodeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model\nmulti-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution\nremains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how\nto gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels\nof the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch\ncouplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on\nsynthetic and imaging data.

Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy,\nemploying separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing\ntemporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt\nunsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex\nscenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding\nfor Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user\ninstructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated\nannotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process.\nFirst, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the\ninstruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through\ninstruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection\nto pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we\nconstruct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed\ntemporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model,\nwhich takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities\nof Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner.\nCoupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements\nacross multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its\nsuperiority and great potentials for video understanding."}

It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no\nrational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce\nauxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal\ndiscounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve\nmathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually\nperceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative\napproach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse\npartitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are\ngrouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a\nrepresentative element of its group before being added. This method allows for\na phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a\nbehavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as\na definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a\nplausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might\nhandle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg\nseries can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed\npartition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral\nmodeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations."}

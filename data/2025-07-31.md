### [1] [When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149)
*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在欺骗性指令下内部表征的变化，发现欺骗性指令会导致显著的表示偏移，并识别了敏感特征和层级的欺骗特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决其安全性挑战。

Method: 通过分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct的内部表征，使用线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）研究欺骗性与真实性/中性指令的差异。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致早期到中期层的显著表示偏移，并识别出敏感特征和不同的表示子空间。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和层级特征，为LLM的检测和控制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

### [2] [Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22197)
*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI的系统性（systematicity）不仅是可解释性的一部分，而是一个更广泛的概念，涉及思想的连贯性、一致性和原则性。作者提出了一个区分四种系统性意义的框架，并探讨了AI模型是否需要达到这种系统性标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清系统性在AI中的重要性，超越传统的可解释性讨论，探索AI是否应追求更高级别的系统性。

Method: 作者提出了一个概念框架，区分了四种系统性意义，并分析了系统性需求与AI模型之间的关系。

Result: 结果表明，AI模型的系统性需求应根据具体的理性依据动态调整，而非一刀切。

Conclusion: 结论指出，AI的系统性需求应根据实际应用场景和理性依据灵活调整，而非盲目追求高标准。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

### [3] [CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22281)
*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层代理架构CoEx，通过动态更新的世界模型改进LLM代理的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理设计无法有效整合新观察数据，导致静态世界模型与真实世界状态脱节，产生错误规划。

Method: 引入分层状态抽象的CoEx架构，结合LLM推理和神经符号信念状态动态更新世界模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx表现优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型和分层规划，显著提升了LLM代理的规划与探索能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

### [4] [An Explainable Emotion Alignment Framework for LLM-Empowered Agent in Metaverse Service Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22326)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的兴起，代理在元宇宙服务生态系统中扮演关键角色，但现有代理在虚拟与现实服务融合方面存在挑战，如数据融合、知识关联和伦理安全。

Method: 提出一个可解释的情感对齐框架，将事实因素整合到LLM代理的决策循环中，实现更相关的事实对齐。

Result: 在O2O外卖场景的模拟实验中验证了框架的有效性，获得了更真实的社会涌现。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM代理在元宇宙服务生态系统中的虚拟与现实服务融合提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI代理在自主完成任务时的局限性及安全风险，提出了人机协作系统Magentic-UI，通过多种交互机制提升效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI代理在复杂任务中表现出色，但仍未达到人类水平，且存在安全和操控风险。人机协作系统有望结合人类监督与AI效率。

Method: 开发了开源Web界面Magentic-UI，支持多工具扩展，并引入六种交互机制（如共同规划、任务守卫等）。

Result: 在自主任务完成、用户测试、定性研究和安全评估中，Magentic-UI展示了高效和安全的人机协作潜力。

Conclusion: Magentic-UI为人机协作提供了安全高效的解决方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

### [6] [LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359)
*Qianhong Guo,Wei Xie,Xiaofang Cai,Enze Wang,Shuoyoucheng Ma,Kai Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Baosheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无基准评估范式LLM-Crowdsourced，通过LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，解决了现有评估方法的数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估LLM的真实能力。

Method: 提出LLM-Crowdsourced方法，利用LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，满足动态、透明、客观和专业的评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程任务上验证了该方法在区分LLM性能上的优势，并发现了一些传统方法难以检测的新现象。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced方法为LLM评估提供了一种更全面、客观的解决方案，并揭示了LLM的新行为特征。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [7] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI的元认知敏感性（区分预测正确与否的能力）与预测准确性共同影响人类决策质量。研究发现，元认知敏感性高的AI即使预测准确性较低，也能提升人类决策表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性如何共同影响人类决策质量，以优化AI辅助决策的效果。

Method: 提出理论框架分析AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性的联合作用，并通过行为实验验证。

Result: 元认知敏感性高的AI能显著提升人类决策表现，即使其预测准确性较低。

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助决策时需同时考虑预测准确性和元认知敏感性，并优化两者以实现更优决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于样本保真度的通用智能标准，认为智能是能够从同一类别中生成样本的能力，并形式化为ε-类别智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了构建通用人工智能（AGI），需要一种能够评估智能本质的物种无关形式，同时涵盖多种智能行为范式。

Method: 提出ε-类别智能的框架，通过样本生成能力定义智能，并设计实验协议验证。

Result: 形式化框架和实验协议为智能评估、安全性和泛化性提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该标准为AGI研究提供了新的评估方向，并可能推动智能行为的统一理解。

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

Conclusion: 提出的推理系统能有效支持设计者在跨国应用中适应法律要求，提升设计灵活性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的NBN计算方法，解决了其计算耗时的问题，并首次揭示了OneMax和TSP问题的景观特征及算法局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NBN计算耗时问题，并将其扩展到组合优化问题以分析算法行为。

Method: 通过理论推导证明NBN作为最大概率转移网络的功能，并提出对数线性时间复杂度的NBN计算方法。

Result: 发现OneMax景观具有中性、崎岖和多模态特征；TSP问题的主要挑战是崎岖、多模态和欺骗性；EAX和LKH算法在应对多模态和欺骗性时存在局限性。

Conclusion: 高效的NBN方法为优化问题提供了新的分析工具，揭示了算法在复杂景观中的行为特征及改进方向。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体交互式医疗分诊系统，解决当前AI分诊系统的三大挑战：医疗专业化不足、机构部门结构差异和低效提问。系统通过三个专用智能体协作，实现高准确率的分诊推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后疫情时代医疗需求激增与护理人员短缺，迫使急诊分诊系统寻求AI驱动的创新解决方案。

Method: 系统采用三个专用智能体（RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent、DepartmentAgent），通过结构化提问和部门特定规则协作，将非结构化症状转化为准确分诊建议。

Result: 实验显示，系统在四次患者交互后，主科室分类准确率达89.2%，次科室达73.9%，并能高效适应不同医院配置。

Conclusion: 该系统为部署可扩展的AI辅助分诊提供了框架，兼顾医疗机构异质性并确保临床决策的可靠性。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

TL;DR: MetaAgent是一个基于有限状态机的框架，能自动生成多智能体系统，并通过优化算法改进。实验表明其性能优于其他自动设计方法，接近人工设计的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工设计多智能体框架局限于预定义场景，而自动设计方法存在工具集成不足、依赖外部数据和通信结构僵化等问题。

Method: 提出MetaAgent框架，通过有限状态机控制智能体行为和状态转换，结合优化算法改进系统设计。

Result: 实验显示，MetaAgent生成的系统优于其他自动设计方法，性能接近人工优化的系统。

Conclusion: MetaAgent为多智能体系统的自动设计提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

*Sebastian Monka,Irlan Grangel-González,Stefan Schmid,Lavdim Halilaj,Marc Rickart,Oliver Rudolph,Rui Dias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言查询自动转换为SPARQL查询，以简化知识图谱（KGs）在制造业中的应用。通过提供KG的上下文信息，LLMs生成查询的准确性和完整性显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造业中知识图谱（KGs）的应用需要复杂的SPARQL查询，这对非专家用户构成障碍。LLMs的潜力在于通过自然语言查询简化这一过程，但需要解决如何有效提供KG上下文的问题。

Method: 论文评估了多种策略，利用LLMs作为中介，将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询。重点研究了Bosch Line Information System KG和I40 Core Information Model，并比较了不同上下文提供方法的效果。

Result: 研究发现，当LLMs获得KG模式的适当上下文时，生成正确且完整查询的能力显著提升。上下文感知提示技术减少了幻觉风险。

Conclusion: 提出的技术有望通过LLMs简化复杂数据存储库的访问，支持制造业中的决策制定。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

TL;DR: asp-fzn是一个基于FlatZinc的CASP求解器，支持线性约束，性能与主流ASP求解器相当，并在某些CASP问题上优于clingcon。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展ASP以支持线性约束，提供更丰富的约束语言。

Method: 将CASP程序翻译为FlatZinc语言，利用多种后端求解器。

Result: 在ASP和CASP基准测试中表现优异，部分优于clingcon。

Conclusion: asp-fzn是一个有竞争力的CASP求解器，性能出色。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决多智能体协作中联合动作空间爆炸和动态沟通问题。

Method: 采用集中训练/集中执行框架，结合多注意力机制和惩罚损失函数。

Result: 在模拟足球环境中表现优于基准算法，协作行为更优。

Conclusion: TAAC在多智能体协作任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession

Abstract: Social sciences have accumulated a rich body of theories and methodologies
for investigating the human mind and behaviors, while offering valuable
insights into the design and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
systems. Focusing on psychology as a prominent case, this study explores the
interdisciplinary synergy between AI and the field by analyzing 1,006
LLM-related papers published in premier AI venues between 2023 and 2025, along
with the 2,544 psychology publications they cite. Through our analysis, we
identify key patterns of interdisciplinary integration, locate the psychology

### [17] [Automatically discovering heuristics in a complex SAT solver with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22876)
*Yiwen Sun,Furong Ye,Zhihan Chen,Ke Wei,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）优化SAT求解器的新方法，开发了工具AutoModSAT，解决了LLM兼容性、自动提示优化和高效搜索策略三大挑战，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SAT求解器在复杂架构下优化困难，现有自动配置框架性能提升有限，因此探索AI驱动的启发式发现方法。

Method: 1. 开发LLM友好的模块化解器；2. 提出无监督自动提示优化方法；3. 设计预搜索策略和进化算法。

Result: AutoModSAT性能比基线提升50%，优于SOTA求解器30%，速度平均提升20%。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代复杂求解器开发提供了方法论和实证结果，填补了AI启发式发现与关键系统优化之间的空白。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

TL;DR: 介绍首个完全由人工撰写的印尼语偏好数据集IndoPref，用于评估LLM生成文本的自然性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼语在LLM偏好研究中代表性不足，现有数据集多为英语翻译，缺乏文化和语言真实性。

Method: 创建IndoPref数据集，所有标注均为印尼语原生撰写，并使用Krippendorff's alpha评估标注一致性。

Result: 数据集在多个LLM上进行了基准测试，评估了各模型的输出质量。

Conclusion: IndoPref填补了印尼语偏好数据集的空白，为LLM研究提供了文化和语言真实性的支持。

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

*Kimberly Le Truong,Riccardo Fogliato,Hoda Heidari,Zhiwei Steven Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前大语言模型（LLM）评估基准缺乏写作风格多样性，可能导致模型在非标准输入下表现不稳定。作者通过基于角色的提示重写方法验证了这一假设，发现写作风格显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准的写作风格单一，无法全面反映人类沟通的多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现不佳。

Method: 采用基于角色的LLM提示重写方法，模拟多样化的写作风格。

Result: 研究发现，即使语义内容相同，写作风格和提示格式的变化也会显著影响LLM的性能评估。某些写作风格会一致地触发模型的高或低性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种可扩展的方法，通过增强现有基准的多样性，提高LLM性能评估的外部有效性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化流程，利用大语言模型（LLMs）估计动词框架频率（VFFs），优于现有工具，并生成新的VFF数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上受限，无法满足对动词框架频率的需求。

Method: 使用LLMs生成包含476个英语动词的句子语料库，并指导LLM像专家语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于两种广泛使用的句法分析器，且资源消耗远低于手动分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为自动化框架频率估计提供了概念验证，并发布了代码和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现媒体记忆性（媒体内容对投资者记忆的影响）对初创企业获得风投有显著作用，超越了单纯媒体曝光频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨媒体内容如何通过更细致的线索（如初创企业的独特性和语义网络中的连接性）影响风投决策。

Method: 分析197家英国微纳米技术初创企业（1995-2004年）的数据，评估媒体记忆性对投资结果的影响。

Result: 媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果，风投更关注初创企业的独特性和在新闻语义网络中的连接性。

Conclusion: 初创企业应通过更有针对性的媒体报道增强品牌记忆性，而非仅追求曝光频率。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了上下文熵的估计方法，发现基于首子词令牌的估计会低估真实熵值，蒙特卡洛方法更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证首子词令牌估计上下文熵的准确性，避免潜在失真。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛方法估计词熵，允许词跨多个令牌。

Result: 回归实验显示首子词令牌与蒙特卡洛估计结果存在差异。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用首子词令牌近似估计上下文熵。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习框架，通过外部教师模型（GPT-4o）的连续反馈，减少对静态三元组数据的依赖，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法依赖大量静态三元组数据且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈解决这一问题。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程，演员生成假设，教师模型优化并提供反馈，演员根据反馈调整行为。结合负编辑距离和COMET分数作为奖励信号。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义充分性和实体保留方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和渐进学习，显著提升了机器翻译的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLMs是否学习到功能驱动的梯度性构造表征，以支持UCx理论。

Method: 分析Pythia-1.4B模型中对英语双宾语和介词宾语构造的神经表征，使用5000对句子数据集，通过几何方法（如能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度）评估表征分离性。

Result: LLMs的构造表征分离性受梯度偏好强度调节，更典型的构造实例在激活空间中占据更独特的区域。

Conclusion: LLMs学习到了丰富、功能驱动的梯度性构造表征，支持了构造主义原则在LLMs中的几何测量。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统任务导向对话系统需要大量标注数据，而本研究旨在通过结合BERT和LLM的优势，减少数据依赖并提高性能。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合BERT的计算效率和LLM的泛化能力，在零样本和少样本设置下进行意图识别和OOS检测。

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上的实验表明，通过共享BERT输出信息给LLM，系统性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了数据需求，同时提升了意图识别和OOS检测的性能。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以建模人格语义并实现跨模态理解。

Method: 使用心理学提示引导大语言模型提取人格语义，设计文本为中心的多模态融合网络，包括降维、跨模态连接和文本特征增强模块。

Result: 在AVI验证集上MSE降低45%，在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了人格评估的准确性，为多模态人格分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

Result: 现代LLMs能生成高质量且风格合适的专利摘要，优于领域基线。

Conclusion: PATENTWRITER框架有效，代码和数据集开源以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

<details>

Motivation: NIAH基准虽广泛用于评估LLMs的长上下文理解能力，但可能高估其真实能力，需更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出NeedleChain基准，上下文全为查询相关信息，并引入ROPE Contraction策略改进LLMs的长上下文理解。

Result: 实验显示先进LLMs（如GPT-4o）在完全理解长上下文方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction提供了更全面的LLMs长上下文能力评估和改进方法。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code

Motivation: 探讨AI生成故事是否能够体现不同国家的文化多样性，揭示AI在叙事上的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和文化内容。

Result: 生成的故事叙事结构单一，缺乏文化深度和真实冲突，表现出明显的叙事标准化。

Conclusion: AI生成的叙事存在结构同质化问题，这是一种新型的AI偏见，需引起重视。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

TL;DR: Falcon-H1 是一个新型混合架构大语言模型系列，结合 Transformer 和 State Space Models，性能高效且适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过混合架构提升模型的长上下文记忆和计算效率，挑战传统设计。

Method: 采用 Transformer 和 State Space Models 的并行混合架构，优化数据策略和训练动态。

Result: Falcon-H1 在多个参数规模下表现优异，旗舰模型 Falcon-H1-34B 性能媲美更大规模模型。

Conclusion: Falcon-H1 系列在性能、效率和适用性上表现突出，开源许可促进 AI 研究的可及性。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

*Tian Yun,Chen Sun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否是“抽象推理者”，指出零样本性能差，但微调后性能显著提升，但跨数据集泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估LLMs的抽象推理能力，挑战现有观点，并探讨其实际意义。

Method: 通过实验比较零样本和微调后的性能，并测试跨数据集的泛化能力。

Result: 零样本性能差，但微调后性能接近完美；泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义“抽象推理者”的含义，并讨论LLMs是否符合这一标准的重要性。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过前向和后向约束生成的方法，提升代码大语言模型（Code LLMs）在可控代码生成中的指令遵循能力，并引入了多语言基准测试IFEvalCode。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，代码生成不仅需要正确性，还需严格遵循编码风格、行数等细节要求，现有模型在此方面表现不足。

Method: 采用前向和后向约束生成方法，优化Code LLMs的指令遵循能力；构建IFEvalCode基准，包含1.6K测试样本，覆盖7种编程语言和中英查询。

Result: 实验显示闭源模型在可控代码生成上优于开源模型，且模型生成正确代码与严格遵循指令之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究为可控代码生成提供了新方法和评估标准，揭示了模型在指令遵循方面的改进空间。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过后训练技术提升小语言模型（SLMs）在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，实验结果显示显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署上有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳，因此研究如何通过后训练技术提升其性能。

Method: 使用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建两个衍生数据集，并应用监督微调和基于强化学习的后训练，最后采用自一致性修正推理方法。

Result: 在BIRD开发集上，五个评估模型的平均性能提升了31.4分，0.5B模型达到56.87%执行准确率，1.5B模型达到67.08%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了SLMs在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，证明了其潜力和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

TL;DR: CliCARE框架通过将患者电子健康记录转化为时间知识图谱，并结合临床指南，显著提升了大型语言模型在癌症决策支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理长时程、多语言电子健康记录时的不足，减少临床幻觉，并提供可靠的评估指标。

Method: 将非结构化的电子健康记录转化为时间知识图谱，并与指南知识图谱对齐，生成临床总结和建议。

Result: CliCARE在多种数据集上表现优于基线方法，临床有效性得到专家认可。

Conclusion: CliCARE为癌症决策支持提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Motivation: 由于缺乏反映真实客户交互的基准数据集，企业在选择适合的ViLLMs模型时面临困难。

Method: 研究团队创建了CSConDa数据集，包含9000多个真实客户服务问答对，并开发了一个综合评估框架，对11个轻量级开源ViLLMs进行了自动指标和句法分析。

Result: 研究揭示了模型的优缺点和语言模式，为下一代ViLLMs的开发提供了改进方向。

Conclusion: 通过建立稳健的基准和系统化评估，该研究支持企业在客户服务问答中做出明智的模型选择，并推动了越南语大语言模型的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

TL;DR: ControlMed是一种医学语言模型，通过精细控制标记让用户主动调节推理长度，解决了现有推理LLMs在临床环境中因冗长推理过程导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要高可靠性的支持，但现有推理LLMs因冗长推理过程导致计算开销和延迟，限制了实际应用。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）预训练大规模合成医学指令数据；2）监督微调多长度推理数据；3）强化学习提升准确性和质量。

Result: 实验表明ControlMed在英语和韩语医学基准测试中性能媲美或优于现有模型，用户可灵活平衡推理准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是临床问答和医学信息分析的实用且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CognitiveAttack框架，利用多认知偏差组合攻击LLM安全机制，显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全机制易受认知偏差攻击，但多偏差交互的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，生成嵌入优化偏差组合的提示词。

Result: 在30种LLM中测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%）。

Conclusion: 多偏差交互是强大攻击向量，为LLM安全研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在多语言模型中的作用，尤其是在低资源语言中的潜在优势。

Method: 通过干预18种语言（包括低资源语言）的语言特定神经元，比较放大效果，并使用提出的LSS评分评估语言转向效果。

Result: 最优放大因子能有效转向目标语言，但在下游任务中仅部分提升自语言性能，跨语言结果普遍下降。

Conclusion: 语言特定神经元的放大对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

TL;DR: BALSAM是一个针对阿拉伯语大语言模型（LLM）的综合基准测试平台，旨在解决数据稀缺、语言多样性和评估标准不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语LLM的性能落后于英语，主要由于数据稀缺、语言多样性、形态复杂性以及现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 引入BALSAM，一个包含78个NLP任务、52K示例的社区驱动基准测试平台，提供透明和盲测评估。

Result: BALSAM涵盖14个任务类别，分为37K测试和15K开发示例，为阿拉伯语LLM发展提供统一标准。

Conclusion: BALSAM旨在推动阿拉伯语LLM的研究与合作，提升其能力。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Motivation: 探索LLMs中语言特定处理的神经机制，以理解模型如何区分和处理不同语言。

Method: 使用LAPE方法分析语言特定神经元，并通过语言算术操作（激活加减乘除）干预模型行为。

Result: 发现神经元在深层聚类，非拉丁文字语言更具特异性；语言算术操作在多语言任务中优于简单替换方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs的语言处理机制，为多语言任务提供了新的干预方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可控性，为未来研究和应用提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉显性和隐性线索，实现了高效且无偏的面试表现评估。

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

Result: 在四个多跳QA数据集上表现优于现有RAG方法，并能泛化到单跳任务。

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1显著提升推理能力和稳定性，为RAG方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升LLM在多语言环境中的可靠性，填补非英语语言幻觉研究的空白。

Method: 分析GPT-3.5、GPT-4o等六种LLM在印地语、波斯语和汉语中的事实与语言错误。

Result: 汉语中幻觉最少，印地语和波斯语中幻觉显著更多。

Conclusion: 需针对不同语言优化LLM以减少幻觉，尤其是印地语和波斯语。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过聚合技术、提示工程和对比微调，将预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）有效适配为文本嵌入模型，并在MTEB基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成中表现优异，但其词级表征在聚合为文本嵌入时会丢失关键信息，而许多非生成任务（如聚类、分类或检索）需要准确且可控的句子或文档级嵌入。

Method: 研究采用三种策略：(i) 词嵌入的聚合技术，(ii) 任务特定的提示工程，(iii) 通过对比微调进行文本级增强。

Result: 结合这些方法在MTEB的英文聚类任务中达到最优性能，且微调后注意力更集中于语义相关词汇。

Conclusion: LLMs可通过提示工程和资源高效的对比微调有效适配为文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

Motivation: 减少抽象摘要中的幻觉问题是语言模型实际应用中的关键挑战。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型生成基线摘要，计算EHI分数，并通过强化学习微调模型参数，以EHI作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，EHI在多数据集上均有提升，实体级幻觉显著减少，且不影响流畅性或信息量。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注，可扩展性强，并提供了可复现的Colab流程，便于进一步研究。

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit

employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents

present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，用于解决查询聚焦表摘要中自然语言计划的模糊性和缺乏结构性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划在查询聚焦表摘要中存在模糊性和缺乏结构性的问题，限制了其转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力，尤其是在多表任务中。

Method: 提出结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，分为三个阶段：结构化规划生成TaSoF，基于图的执行将计划步骤转换为SQL并通过有向循环图建模依赖关系以实现并行执行，最后生成查询聚焦摘要。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表设置中均优于现有模型，证明了结构化表示的优势。

Conclusion: 结构化表示能够显著提升查询聚焦表摘要的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.

Motivation: 探索ICL中未被研究的位置偏差，揭示其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 设计系统评估流程，引入ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE指标，在多种任务和模型上测试。

Result: 演示位置对模型性能影响显著，开头位置表现最优，末尾位置预测翻转率高。

Conclusion: 位置偏差普遍存在，需在ICL应用中优化演示位置以提升性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

Abstract: Physics Engines (PEs) are fundamental software frameworks that simulate
physical interactions in applications ranging from entertainment to
safety-critical systems. Despite their importance, PEs suffer from physics
failures, deviations from expected physical behaviors that can compromise
software reliability, degrade user experience, and potentially cause critical
failures in autonomous vehicles or medical robotics. Current testing approaches
for PE-based software are inadequate, typically requiring white-box access and
focusing on crash detection rather than semantically complex physics failures.
This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study characterizing
physics failures in PE-based software. We investigate three research questions
addressing the manifestations of physics failures, the effectiveness of
detection techniques, and developer perceptions of current detection practices.
Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of physics failure manifestations;
(2) a comprehensive evaluation of detection methods including deep learning,
prompt-based techniques, and large multimodal models; and (3) actionable
insights from developer experiences for improving detection approaches. To
support future research, we release PhysiXFails, code, and other materials at

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对生成模型在多维度（如质量、对齐性、多样性等）上复杂权衡的探索，主要原因是缺乏细粒度数据集和单一指标的局限性。

Conclusion: TRIG-Bench和TRIGScore为生成模型的维度权衡提供了系统化分析工具，DTM能有效指导模型优化。

Abstract: Model performance in text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation
often depends on multiple aspects, including quality, alignment, diversity, and
robustness. However, models' complex trade-offs among these dimensions have
rarely been explored due to (1) the lack of datasets that allow fine-grained
quantification of these trade-offs, and (2) the use of a single metric for
multiple dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce TRIG-Bench (Trade-offs in
Image Generation), which spans 10 dimensions (Realism, Originality, Aesthetics,
Content, Relation, Style, Knowledge, Ambiguity, Toxicity, and Bias), contains
40,200 samples, and covers 132 pairwise dimensional subsets. Furthermore, we
develop TRIGScore, a VLM-as-judge metric that automatically adapts to various
dimensions. Based on TRIG-Bench and TRIGScore, we evaluate 14 models across T2I
and I2I tasks. In addition, we propose the Relation Recognition System to
generate the Dimension Trade-off Map (DTM) that visualizes the trade-offs among
model-specific capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that DTM consistently
provides a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs between dimensions for
each type of generative model. Notably, we show that the model's
dimension-specific weaknesses can be mitigated through fine-tuning on DTM to
enhance overall performance. Code is available at:

Abstract: Humans possess innate meta-learning capabilities, partly attributable to
their exceptional color perception. In this paper, we pioneer an innovative
viewpoint on few-shot learning by simulating human color perception mechanisms.
We propose the ColorSense Learner, a bio-inspired meta-learning framework that
capitalizes on inter-channel feature extraction and interactive learning. By
strategically emphasizing distinct color information across different channels,
our approach effectively filters irrelevant features while capturing
discriminative characteristics. Color information represents the most intuitive
visual feature, yet conventional meta-learning methods have predominantly
neglected this aspect, focusing instead on abstract feature differentiation
across categories. Our framework bridges the gap via synergistic color-channel
interactions, enabling better intra-class commonality extraction and larger
inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce a meta-distiller based on
knowledge distillation, ColorSense Distiller, which incorporates prior teacher
knowledge to augment the student network's meta-learning capacity. We've
conducted comprehensive coarse/fine-grained and cross-domain experiments on
eleven few-shot benchmarks for validation. Numerous experiments reveal that our
methods have extremely strong generalization ability, robustness, and
transferability, and effortless handle few-shot classification from the
perspective of color perception.

TL;DR: DL-based segmentation for paediatric brain tumours shows promise for whole tumour and T2-hyperintensity, but struggles with enhancing tumour and cystic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in paediatric brain tumours by evaluating DL-based segmentation across diverse subtypes and MRI protocols.

Method: Used a 3D nnU-Net model on a cohort of 174 patients with various PBT subtypes, assessing performance via Dice similarity coefficient.

Result: Model achieved robust performance for whole tumour and T2-hyperintensity (DSC: 0.85), comparable to human variability, but was less accurate for enhancing tumour (DSC: 0.75) and poor for cystic components.

Conclusion: DL is feasible for PBT segmentation, supporting protocol simplification, but requires refinement for challenging regions like enhancing tumour and cystic components.

Abstract: Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,
encompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and
outcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade
gliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose
diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation
offers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across
heterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A
retrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,
medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI
sequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual
annotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),
T2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D
nnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation
performance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared
against intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust
performance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator
variability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean
DSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by
tumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2
alone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL
is feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and
CC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings
support the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance
volumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督语义分割方法依赖昂贵的数据标注，且在无标签或语义模糊的环境中表现不佳。无监督分割方法通常缺乏时间一致性，影响鲁棒性。

Method: Frontier-Seg通过聚类基础模型（如DINOv2）提取的超像素级特征，并强制帧间时间一致性，实现无监督地形分割。

Result: 在RUGD和RELLIS-3D等数据集上的实验表明，Frontier-Seg能在无监督条件下有效分割非结构化地形。

Conclusion: Frontier-Seg填补了无监督分割中时间一致性的空白，为非结构化环境下的自主导航提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven
by advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on
costly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep
models. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in
unrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and
semantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot
approaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but
typically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical
property for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this
gap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised
segmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters
superpixel-level features extracted from foundation model
backbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames

Motivation: CLIP模型在图像-文本对齐中存在信息错位和表征纠缠问题，限制了其在下游任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\citep{radford2021learning}
has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,
achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual
representations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with
potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from
entangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in
datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the
model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the
other hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the
retention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning
disentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on
certain downstream tasks involving short prompts.
  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible
alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of
granularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only
\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also
\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual
concepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \ours, a novel approach
that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations
in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its
capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification
theory. The code is available at https://github.com/Mid-Push/SmartCLIP.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于HOG-CNN的自动化临床决策支持框架，用于视网膜疾病的早期检测，结合手工特征和深度学习特征，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视网膜疾病诊断依赖人工，耗时耗力，需要自动化且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 融合手工HOG特征和深度CNN特征，构建HOG-CNN模型，在APTOS 2019、ORIGA和IC-AMD数据集上进行评估。

Result: 模型在DR分类、AMD诊断和青光眼检测中表现优异，准确率和AUC均超过90%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOG-CNN是一种轻量级、可解释且高效的自动化视网膜疾病筛查工具，适合资源有限的临床环境。

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and
diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,
however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and
resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and
interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature
extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration
of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our
model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features
from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark
datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for
Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates
consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for
binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the
IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,
outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,
our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive
performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive
appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.
The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable
for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results
position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease
screening.

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected
around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort
required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to
considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels
into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model
yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial,
temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate
and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global
scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to
consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a
diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a
dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017
through 2024.

Conclusion: LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net在稀疏视图CT重建中优于现有方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a learnable variational model that learns the features and
leverages complementary information from both image and measurement domains for
image reconstruction. In particular, we introduce a learned alternating
minimization algorithm (LAMA) from our prior work, which tackles two-block
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by incorporating a residual
learning architecture in a proximal alternating framework. In this work, our
goal is to provide a complete and rigorous convergence proof of LAMA and show
that all accumulation points of a specified subsequence of LAMA must be Clarke
stationary points of the problem. LAMA directly yields a highly interpretable
neural network architecture called LAMA-Net. Notably, in addition to the
results shown in our prior work, we demonstrate that the convergence property
of LAMA yields outstanding stability and robustness of LAMA-Net in this work.
We also show that the performance of LAMA-Net can be further improved by
integrating a properly designed network that generates suitable initials, which
we call iLAMA-Net. To evaluate LAMA-Net/iLAMA-Net, we conduct several
experiments and compare them with several state-of-the-art methods on popular
benchmark datasets for Sparse-View Computed Tomography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作域适应（CDA）框架，结合ViT和CNN，用于基于MRI的晚年抑郁症检测，解决了样本量小和域异质性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 晚年抑郁症（LLD）的准确检测对疾病监测和干预至关重要，但现有方法受限于小样本和域异质性。

Method: CDA框架分三阶段：源数据监督训练、目标特征自监督适应和协作训练，结合ViT和CNN。

Result: 在多站点MRI数据上，CDA优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: CDA有效提升了LLD检测的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate identification of late-life depression (LLD) using structural brain
MRI is essential for monitoring disease progression and facilitating timely
intervention. However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are
often constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant
challenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although
incorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial
domain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner
hardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain
transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain
Adaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA
leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with
each branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists
of three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)
self-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on
unlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by
self-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between
classifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.
The collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented
target-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak
augmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the
CDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation
methods.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够处理不利输入视角。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了3D高斯泼溅模型在未知相机姿态下的鲁棒性和适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup
for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and
renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable
views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios
involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free
feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors
learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained
model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a
Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians
derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to
render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new
training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of
favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google
Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate
the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Result: DeltaVLM在单轮描述和多轮交互分析中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RSICA和DeltaVLM为遥感图像变化分析提供了高效、交互式的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of land-cover changes in multi-temporal satellite
imagery is critical for real-world scenarios. However, existing methods
typically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their
ability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we
introduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that
combines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to
enable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal
remote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a
large-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid
rule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change
captioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question
answering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM
features three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to
capture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a
cross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and
(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant
difference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual
instructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large
language model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize
efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that
DeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning
and multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal
large language models and remote sensing vision-language models. Code, dataset
and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/hanlinwu/DeltaVLM.

Result: FaceGCD在GFD任务中显著优于现有GCD方法和ArcFace基线，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FaceGCD为开放世界人脸识别提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recognizing and differentiating among both familiar and unfamiliar faces is a
critical capability for face recognition systems and a key step toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Motivated by this ability, this paper
introduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face
recognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized
category discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled
known identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen
IDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high
cardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD
approaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method
that dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using
lightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a
HyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned
on each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle
identity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms
existing GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving
state-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face
recognition.

Abstract: To address the larger computation and storage requirements associated with

temporal information in a significantly smaller dataset, such that training on
the distilled data has comparable performance to training on all of the data.
We propose GVD: Guiding Video Diffusion, the first diffusion-based video

ensuring high-fidelity video generation across diverse actions while capturing
essential motion information. Our method's diverse yet representative
distillations significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches on
the MiniUCF and HMDB51 datasets across 5, 10, and 20 Instances Per Class (IPC).
Specifically, our method achieves 78.29 percent of the original dataset's
performance using only 1.98 percent of the total number of frames in MiniUCF.
Additionally, it reaches 73.83 percent of the performance with just 3.30
percent of the frames in HMDB51. Experimental results across benchmark video
datasets demonstrate that GVD not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
but can also generate higher resolution videos and higher IPC without
significantly increasing computational cost.

Conclusion: GEMS框架为情绪理解研究提供了新方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with
contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social
situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of
predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event
level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer
and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group
members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing
multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions
primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,
we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic
analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims
to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and
arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our
benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses
holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted
state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on
VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further
research. The code and data is available at:

Motivation: 揭示VLMs在频率域扰动下的脆弱性，挑战其作为感知模块的可靠性。

Method: 设计频率域的目标图像变换，测试五种先进VLMs的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明VLMs对频率扰动敏感，输出与语义内容不完全一致。

Conclusion: VLMs在真实黑盒条件下不可靠，需开发更鲁棒的多模态感知系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used as perceptual modules for
visual content reasoning, including through captioning and DeepFake detection.
In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to
subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we
highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake
detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image
transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM
outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We
demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five
state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP
models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that
VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align
with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial
frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated
image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under
realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs,
underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.

Motivation: 解决MAE在掩码策略和分布外数据上的性能依赖问题。

Result: MINR在域内和域外场景均优于MAE，同时降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: MINR是现有框架的鲁棒高效替代方案，适用于多种自监督学习任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown
significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in
image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is
often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can
degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that
synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR
learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and
generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain
scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model
complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning
applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to
existing frameworks.

efforts, existing approaches still struggle to effectively eliminate artifacts
due to the diverse scales, orientations, and color shifts of moir\'e patterns,
primarily because the constrained receptive field of CNN-based architectures
limits their ability to capture the complex characteristics of moir\'e
patterns. In this paper, we propose MZNet, a U-shaped network designed to bring
images closer to a 'Moire-Zero' state by effectively removing moir\'e patterns.
It integrates three specialized components: Multi-Scale Dual Attention Block
(MSDAB) for extracting and refining multi-scale features, Multi-Shape Large
Kernel Convolution Block (MSLKB) for capturing diverse moir\'e structures, and
Feature Fusion-Based Skip Connection for enhancing information flow. Together,
these components enhance local texture restoration and large-scale artifact
suppression. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MZNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets and delivers
competitive results on lower-resolution dataset, while maintaining a low
computational cost, suggesting that it is an efficient and practical solution
for real-world applications. Project page:

Result: UAVScenes支持分割、深度估计、6-DoF定位、地点识别和新视角合成等任务。

Conclusion: UAVScenes填补了多模态无人机感知的空白，为高级场景理解任务提供了基准。

Abstract: Multi-modal perception is essential for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
operations, as it enables a comprehensive understanding of the UAVs'
surrounding environment. However, most existing multi-modal UAV datasets are
primarily biased toward localization and 3D reconstruction tasks, or only
support map-level semantic segmentation due to the lack of frame-wise
annotations for both camera images and LiDAR point clouds. This limitation
prevents them from being used for high-level scene understanding tasks. To
address this gap and advance multi-modal UAV perception, we introduce
UAVScenes, a large-scale dataset designed to benchmark various tasks across
both 2D and 3D modalities. Our benchmark dataset is built upon the
well-calibrated multi-modal UAV dataset MARS-LVIG, originally developed only
for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We enhance this dataset by
providing manually labeled semantic annotations for both frame-wise images and
LiDAR point clouds, along with accurate 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) poses.
These additions enable a wide range of UAV perception tasks, including
segmentation, depth estimation, 6-DoF localization, place recognition, and
novel view synthesis (NVS). Our dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于条件流匹配的方法，用于医学图像分割中的不确定性量化，优于现有生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，专家标注的自然变异性（aleatoric uncertainty）需要准确量化，现有生成模型表达能力有限。

Method: 利用条件流匹配（simulation-free flow-based generative model）学习精确密度，通过输入图像引导生成多个分割样本。

Result: 方法不仅分割精度高，还能生成反映数据分布的不确定性图，捕捉边界模糊区域的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在量化分割不确定性方面表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Abstract: Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success
of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision
encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language
models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:
Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair
data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for
continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this
vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework
leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four
complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative
descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this
pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset
enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further
propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by
incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised
signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable
improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data
scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding
tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models
trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data
than ours. All code, data, and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊和低光条件导致传统姿态估计模型性能下降，现有数据集假设稳定条件，无法适应模糊环境。

Method: 利用事件相机的高时间分辨率数据生成运动感知模糊图像，结合师生框架和不确定性掩码迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 方法在运动模糊环境下优于传统领域自适应方法，无需目标域标注即可实现鲁棒姿态估计。

Conclusion: 事件相机为真实世界运动模糊环境中的领域自适应提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,
sports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light
conditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation
due to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume
stable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred
environments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach
that leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion
data and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,
we generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap
between sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.
Additionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines
pseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect
labels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose
estimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without
requiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the
potential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain
adaptation in real-world motion blur environments. Our project codes are

Conclusion: TopoLiDM在生成高保真LiDAR场景方面表现出色，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: LiDAR scene generation is critical for mitigating real-world LiDAR data
collection costs and enhancing the robustness of downstream perception tasks in
autonomous driving. However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture
geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion
Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for
improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to
model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel
framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models
under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our
approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph
representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.
Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the
latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology
(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world
global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset
demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving
improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower
Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast
generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing
its scalability for real-world applications. We will release the related codes

Motivation: 解决现有任务驱动图像恢复方法在处理多复杂退化图像时性能不足的问题。

Result: EDTR显著提升了多复杂退化任务中的性能和视觉质量。

Conclusion: EDTR有效利用扩散先验，为任务驱动图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address
performance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.
Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images
are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for
restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most
powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help
generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details
remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address
this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior
to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging
useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from
pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we
employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant
details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our
method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing
task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex
degradations.

Motivation: 现有方法在无监督视频对象分割（UVOS）中过度依赖高层语义特征，导致缺乏细粒度信息，性能提升有限。

Method: 提出层次化记忆架构，结合浅层和高层特征，并设计异构交互机制（PLAM和SGIM模块）平衡像素和语义信息的利用。

Conclusion: 层次化记忆架构和异构交互机制有效解决了UVOS中细粒度信息不足的问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level
masks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.
While memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation
paradigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains
despite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental
flaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic
features. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained
information due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,
memory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly
capture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise
predictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical
memory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for
memory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic
information. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel
and semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism
to perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their
inherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local
Alignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),
we achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level
memory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical
Memory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection
benchmarks. Moreover, HMHI-Net consistently exhibits high performance across
different backbones, further demonstrating its superiority and robustness.

Result: 零样本模型表现优于现有方法，InstructBLIP在零样本和微调场景下均优于传统分类器。

Conclusion: VLM在深度伪造检测中具有显著优势，尤其是在零样本场景下表现突出。

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models
for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media,
identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of
existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized
classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing
only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could
enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of
Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image
classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we
utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which
our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing
methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing
architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against
traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

Abstract: Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using
multimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing
methods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive
fusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a
Lightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently
perceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different
modalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack
segmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive
Cue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain
Dynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack
cues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning
Strategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain
Perceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture
spatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a
Lightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive
complex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing
most convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
On the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465
in mIoU with only 5.35M parameters. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: CamFlow通过混合运动基和新损失函数，显著提升了2D相机运动估计的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models
the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods
rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or
meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with
complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining
flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be
represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework
that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived
from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach
includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution
that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by
masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure
camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization
in zero-shot settings. Code and datasets are available at our project page:

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions cause diverse and complex degradation patterns,
driving the development of All-in-One (AiO) models. However, recent AiO
solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global
filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle
highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose
Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that
leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather
image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge
features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via
Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to
effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features
are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions
based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,
we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather
removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.
We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel
attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise
relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the
superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the
varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.

Abstract: Underwater images typically suffer from severe colour distortions, low
visibility, and reduced structural clarity due to complex optical effects such
as scattering and absorption, which greatly degrade their visual quality and
limit the performance of downstream visual perception tasks. Existing
enhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation
conditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors
effectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional
diffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a
degraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level
using a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous
degradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a
novel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet
backbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature
refinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further
propose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss
function that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and
feature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with
superior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details. Compared
with SOTA approaches, our framework achieves significant improvements in both
quantitative metrics and qualitative visual assessments.

Abstract: Natural Human-Robot Interaction (N-HRI) requires robots to recognize human
actions at varying distances and states, regardless of whether the robot itself
is in motion or stationary. This setup is more flexible and practical than
conventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks
designed for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique
complexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and
diversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored
specifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service
robots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and
46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.
Participants performed various human actions in diverse environments at
distances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,
simulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights
due to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to
advance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we
propose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long
distances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic
Ellipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human
actions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACTIVE-PC. Our
code is available at:

Abstract: The segmentation of the hepatic vasculature in surgical videos holds
substantial clinical significance in the context of hepatectomy procedures.
However, owing to the dearth of an appropriate dataset and the inherently
complex task characteristics, few researches have been reported in this domain.
To address this issue, we first introduce a high quality frame-by-frame
annotated hepatic vasculature dataset containing 35 long hepatectomy videos and
11442 high-resolution frames. On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution
video vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed
a pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers
of the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information
degradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed
a dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the
transmission of redundant information while preserving more details between
frames. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our
proposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The
source code and dataset will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定提示或共享空间生成的提示，限制了提示的多样性，影响任务学习效果。

Result: 在图像分类和视频动作识别任务中，平均性能提升9.07%和7.40%。

Conclusion: 提示演化机制有效提升了持续学习的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning
small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the
complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific
knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either
fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged
during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared
space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To
address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively
aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt
while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both
previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves
accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a
learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to
activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image
classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental
learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods
across all scenarios.

Result: 在内部长尾和公共不平衡乳腺超声数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了分类性能，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized
treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging
modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and
diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed
long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated
recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify
data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for
long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through
high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic
performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven
adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by
training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data
while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our
class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception
branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features
while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house
long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: COOkeD通过结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器的预测，实现了卓越的OOD检测性能，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测在可信赖的图像识别系统中至关重要，但现有方法受限于单一分类器的能力。本研究旨在通过异构集成提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出COOkeD方法，结合封闭世界分类器、零样本CLIP分类器和线性探针分类器的预测，形成异构集成。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet等基准测试中，COOkeD实现了最先进的OOD检测性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: COOkeD通过异构集成显著提升了OOD检测性能，且方法简单、模块化，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in
trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at
test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,
leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised
setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot
setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching
challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by
the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we
show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD
detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD
combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a
specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier
trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is
modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus
introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.
We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also
consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label
noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been
previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art
performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based
OOD detection methods. Code is available at https://github.com/glhr/COOkeD

Abstract: In this paper, we present a deepfake detection algorithm specifically
designed for electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) systems. To ensure the
reliability of eKYC systems against deepfake attacks, it is essential to
develop a robust deepfake detector capable of identifying both face swapping
and face reenactment, while also being robust to image degradation. We address
these challenges through three key contributions: (1)~Our approach evaluates
the video's authenticity by detecting temporal inconsistencies in identity
vectors extracted by face recognition models, leading to comprehensive
detection of both face swapping and face reenactment. (2)~In addition to
processing video input, the algorithm utilizes a registered image (assumed to
be genuine) to calculate identity discrepancies between the input video and the
registered image, significantly improving detection accuracy. (3)~We find that
employing a face feature extractor trained on a larger dataset enhances both
detection performance and robustness against image degradation. Our
experimental results show that our proposed method accurately detects both face
swapping and face reenactment comprehensively and is robust against various
forms of unseen image degradation. Our source code is publicly available

Motivation: 现有基于反向传播的方法因计算成本高和梯度爆炸风险，难以实现完整的梯度反向传播，导致结果不理想。

Result: 方法显著提升对齐性能，优于现有最佳方案。

Conclusion: ShortFT高效且适用于多种奖励函数，显著改进模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Backpropagation-based approaches aim to align diffusion models with reward
functions through end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient within the
denoising chain, offering a promising perspective. However, due to the
computational costs and the risk of gradient explosion associated with the
lengthy denoising chain, existing approaches struggle to achieve complete
gradient backpropagation, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning
strategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we
employ the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,
which enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a
shortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this
chain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the
foundational model. Our method has been rigorously tested and can be
effectively applied to various reward functions, significantly improving
alignment performance and surpassing state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: PCuRL框架有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have
progressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the
inherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic
content and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable
performance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these
limitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model
trained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of
gradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning
abilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically
adjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a
dynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively
regulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing
reasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented
models across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,
logic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: GALTraj首次将生成式主动学习应用于轨迹预测，有效解决长尾问题，且无需改变模型结构。

Abstract: While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of
autonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail
scenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as
using hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to
unlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce
Generative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first
method to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory
prediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and
augments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In
our framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve
tail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware
generation method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate
trajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike
prior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the
first to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in
trajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,
Argoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method
significantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on
head samples.

Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global

Abstract: Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual
expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial
structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,
texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and
Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional
sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a
global description with paired localized sketch + text information for
conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion
adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches
and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized
features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and
global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's
multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia
to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs
are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves
state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized
metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its
unprecedented level of design customization.

Abstract: The proliferation of drones in civilian airspace has raised urgent security
concerns, necessitating robust real-time surveillance systems. In response to
the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload
identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our
approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object
detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams,
deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be
specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality,
addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse
environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation
strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and
fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under
conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting
lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones
from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time
performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the
specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that
collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR
channels.

Conclusion: 该框架通过全局和局部约束的协同作用，为3D点云分割提供了更有效的数据增强方法。

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to individual
points in a scene for fine-grained spatial understanding. Existing methods
typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale
annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local
transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global
structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a
graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for
realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics
from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation.
Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency
between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological
structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph.
Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our
framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to
consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various
models.

Conclusion: 生成基础模型在异常检测中具有显著优势和未来潜力。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is pivotal for deploying safe
vision systems in open-world environments. We revisit diffusion models, not as
generators, but as universal perceptual templates for OOD detection. This
research explores the use of score-based generative models as foundational
tools for semantic anomaly detection across unseen datasets. Specifically, we
leverage the denoising trajectories of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) as a
rich source of texture and semantic information. By analyzing Stein score
errors, amplified through the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), we
introduce a novel method for identifying anomalous samples without requiring
re-training on each target dataset. Our approach improves over state-of-the-art
and relies on training a single model on one dataset -- CelebA -- which we find
to be an effective base distribution, even outperforming more commonly used
datasets like ImageNet in several settings. Experimental results show
near-perfect performance on some benchmarks, with notable headroom on others,
highlighting both the strength and future potential of generative foundation
models in anomaly detection.

### [106] [Image-Guided Shape-from-Template Using Mesh Inextensibility Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22699)

Abstract: Shape-from-Template (SfT) refers to the class of methods that reconstruct the
3D shape of a deforming object from images/videos using a 3D template.
Traditional SfT methods require point correspondences between images and the
texture of the 3D template in order to reconstruct 3D shapes from images/videos
in real time. Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe
occlusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In
contrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by
incorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring
huge amounts of data for supervision. Recent advances use a fully unsupervised
or self-supervised approach by combining differentiable physics and graphics to
deform 3D template to match input images. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised SfT which uses only image observations: color features, gradients
and silhouettes along with a mesh inextensibility constraint to reconstruct at
a $400\times$ faster pace than (best-performing) unsupervised SfT. Moreover,
when it comes to generating finer details and severe occlusions, our method
outperforms the existing methodologies by a large margin. Code is available at

Abstract: Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a
fundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known
algorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite
their acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences
originating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture
of the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,
event cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a
unified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point
correspondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By
formulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a
constant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence
relation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D
points with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its
general formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing
modalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can
even combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the
effectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we
show consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent
approaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and
motion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for
autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to
fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when
navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human
trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space
locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder
that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social
relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction
architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over
all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians
and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the
advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses
and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Generative AI have made video-level deepfake detection
increasingly challenging, exposing the limitations of current detection
techniques. In this paper, we present HOLA, our solution to the Video-Level
Deepfake Detection track of 2025 1M-Deepfakes Detection Challenge. Inspired by
the success of large-scale pre-training in the general domain, we first scale
audio-visual self-supervised pre-training in the multimodal video-level
deepfake detection, which leverages our self-built dataset of 1.81M samples,
thereby leading to a unified two-stage framework. To be specific, HOLA features
an iterative-aware cross-modal learning module for selective audio-visual
interactions, hierarchical contextual modeling with gated aggregations under
the local-global perspective, and a pyramid-like refiner for scale-aware
cross-grained semantic enhancements. Moreover, we propose the pseudo supervised
singal injection strategy to further boost model performance. Extensive
experiments across expert models and MLLMs impressivly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed HOLA. We also conduct a series of ablation
studies to explore the crucial design factors of our introduced components.
Remarkably, our HOLA ranks 1st, outperforming the second by 0.0476 AUC on the

Abstract: Feature matching is a cornerstone task in computer vision, essential for
applications such as image retrieval, stereo matching, 3D reconstruction, and
SLAM. This survey comprehensively reviews modality-based feature matching,
exploring traditional handcrafted methods and emphasizing contemporary deep
learning approaches across various modalities, including RGB images, depth
images, 3D point clouds, LiDAR scans, medical images, and vision-language
interactions. Traditional methods, leveraging detectors like Harris corners and
descriptors such as SIFT and ORB, demonstrate robustness under moderate
intra-modality variations but struggle with significant modality gaps.
Contemporary deep learning-based methods, exemplified by detector-free
strategies like CNN-based SuperPoint and transformer-based LoFTR, substantially
improve robustness and adaptability across modalities. We highlight
modality-aware advancements, such as geometric and depth-specific descriptors
for depth images, sparse and dense learning methods for 3D point clouds,
attention-enhanced neural networks for LiDAR scans, and specialized solutions
like the MIND descriptor for complex medical image matching. Cross-modal
applications, particularly in medical image registration and vision-language
tasks, underscore the evolution of feature matching to handle increasingly
diverse data interactions.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) presents a complex yet critical
challenge in computer vision, requiring robust integration of segmentation and
tracking across temporally dynamic frames. Traditional methods have struggled
with domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.
The emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
its successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven
segmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these
advances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods
for VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and
future. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information
(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from
the current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation
mechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In
doing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to
the streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also
discuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and
trajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error
accumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for
future research. This survey offers a timely and structured overview of the
field, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners in advancing the state of
VOST through the lens of foundation models.

Motivation: 解决低收入国家因缺乏专业超声医师导致的高质量胎儿超声图像获取困难问题。

Method: 基于FetalCLIP模型，引入FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$进行图像质量评估，并尝试将分割模型重新用于分类任务。

Result: FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$在ACOUSLIC-AI数据集上取得最高F1分数0.757，改进后的分割模型进一步达到0.771。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调胎儿超声基础模型可实现任务特定适配，推动资源有限地区的产前护理发展。

Abstract: Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play
a vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,
posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of
trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a
vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal
ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image
quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce
FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN
and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of
0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed
for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of
0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal
ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing
prenatal care in resource-limited settings. The experimental code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLLMs在处理复杂视觉信息时面临高成本和跨模态挑战，MoCHA旨在通过多视觉骨干和动态专家选择解决这些问题。

Method: MoCHA整合了CLIP、SigLIP等四种视觉骨干，采用稀疏专家连接模块（MoECs）和分层组注意力（HGA）优化视觉特征提取和利用。

Result: MoCHA在Phi2-2.7B和Vicuna-7B上表现优异，优于现有开源模型，如POPE任务提升3.25%，MME任务提升153分。

Conclusion: MoCHA通过MoECs和HGA模块显著提升了性能，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling
complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision
encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high
training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual
details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a
novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework
integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to
extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of
Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to
different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the
visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a
Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and
an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two
mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance
across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art
open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo
(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate
hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual
instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further
confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in
improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Motivation: 深度神经网络易受特洛伊（后门）攻击，现有触发器反演方法缺乏对触发器真实性的保证，需改进。

Method: 使用扩散生成器结合目标分类器，迭代生成候选触发器，限制搜索空间并避免强假设。

Result: DISTIL在BackdoorBench数据集上准确率提升7.1%，在特洛伊目标检测模型扫描中提升9.4%。

Conclusion: DISTIL为无需大量数据或强先验假设的后门防御提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous
tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious
concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A
common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious
"shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.
Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under
specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more
than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose
a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search
space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we
incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;
through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the
internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical
evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach
reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned
models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to
7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on
trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction
for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong
prior assumptions about triggers. The code is available at

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal
aorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and
rupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged
wall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD
simulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,
geometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been
proposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a
few seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to
estimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to
common factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep
learning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective
geometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a
dataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are
extracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are
obtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,
as well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately
estimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary
conditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to
different artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added
during inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic
to mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the
proposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic
parameter estimation in clinical practice.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单类和二分类任务中均显著优于现有方法，且对未见过的生成器具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能更有效地检测AI生成人脸，泛化能力强。

Abstract: AI-generated face detectors trained via supervised learning typically rely on
synthesized images from specific generators, limiting their generalization to
emerging generative techniques. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
self-supervised method based on bi-level optimization. In the inner loop, we
pretrain a vision encoder only on photographic face images using a set of
linearly weighted pretext tasks: classification of categorical exchangeable
image file format (EXIF) tags, ranking of ordinal EXIF tags, and detection of
artificial face manipulations. The outer loop then optimizes the relative
weights of these pretext tasks to enhance the coarse-grained detection of
manipulated faces, serving as a proxy task for identifying AI-generated faces.
In doing so, it aligns self-supervised learning more closely with the ultimate
goal of AI-generated face detection. Once pretrained, the encoder remains
fixed, and AI-generated faces are detected either as anomalies under a Gaussian
mixture model fitted to photographic face features or by a lightweight
two-layer perceptron serving as a binary classifier. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our detectors significantly outperform existing approaches in
both one-class and binary classification settings, exhibiting strong
generalization to unseen generators.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法在推理阶段仅利用深度信息进行对象布局估计，未能充分利用其几何信息。DepR旨在在训练和推理阶段均利用深度信息，提升重建效果。

Method: DepR引入深度引导条件化，将形状先验编码到扩散模型中，并在推理阶段通过深度引导DDIM采样和布局优化增强对齐。

Result: DepR在合成和真实数据集上均表现出色，实现了最先进的性能，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DepR通过深度信息的全面利用，显著提升了单视角场景重建的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose DepR, a depth-guided single-view scene reconstruction framework
that integrates instance-level diffusion within a compositional paradigm.
Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates
individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout.
Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation
during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric
information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference.
Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode
shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM
sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the
reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic
data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong
generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于自然语言提示的文本到代码生成方法难以捕捉UI的空间布局和视觉设计意图，而实际UI开发通常是多模态的。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了UI到代码生成的鲁棒性和可解释性，还通过合成数据增强了开源视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end
code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and
democratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely
solely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing
spatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in
practice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or
mockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that
performs UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,
planning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to
detect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical
layout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces
HTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves
robustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.
Furthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that
automatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic
examples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains
in UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,
structural coherence, and code correctness. Our code is made publicly available

Result: CapRecover在CIFAR-10上达到92.71%的Top-1标签准确率，在COCO2017上生成流畅描述（ROUGE-L得分0.52）。保护方法有效防止语义泄漏且无额外训练成本。

Conclusion: CapRecover能高效恢复语义内容，同时提出的噪声保护方法简单有效，为隐私保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in split-DNN
configurations--with visual encoders (e.g., ResNet, ViT) operating on user
devices and sending intermediate features to the cloud--there is a growing
privacy risk from semantic information leakage. Existing approaches to
reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,
semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose
CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level
semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate
features without image reconstruction.
  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating
strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up
to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from
ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis
further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more
semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,
we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to
intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.
Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without
additional training costs.

TL;DR: TR-PTS是一种任务驱动的参数和令牌选择框架，通过优化参数和令牌提升计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有参数高效微调方法任务无关性导致的效率和性能不足问题。

Method: 使用Fisher信息矩阵选择任务相关参数，动态合并冗余令牌。

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB-1k上性能优于全微调，分别提升3.40%和10.35%。

Conclusion: TR-PTS通过任务驱动优化显著提升模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but
are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating
only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are
task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads
to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we
propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven
framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.
Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most
informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining
parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically
preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing
computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS
enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We
evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%,
respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.

Method: LCS基于高效超分辨率（ESR）模型，利用对抗训练、重参数化和量化技术降低模型复杂度，训练数据为低分辨率和高分辨率的游戏图像对。

Result: LCS在五项指标上优于AMD的硬件缩放方案（EASF和FSR1），表现出更好的感知质量。

Conclusion: LCS展示了ESR模型在资源受限设备上进行图像放大的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a
problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an
AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient
super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a
low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on
GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize
adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important
details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce
model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS
alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling
Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different
metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality,
demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained
devices.

Method: 提出四种基于区间编码的紧凑表示法，用于表示查询结果中的时间关系。

Result: 比较了四种表示法在简洁性、唯一性和计算成本上的优劣，最精细的编码能有限表示密集时间查询结果。

Conclusion: 为动态网络的时间路径查询提供了高效的紧凑表示方法，解决了密集时间查询的有限表示问题。

Abstract: We study path-based graph queries that, in addition to navigation through
edges, also perform navigation through time. This allows asking questions about
the dynamics of networks, like traffic movement, cause-effect relationships, or
the spread of a disease. In this setting, a graph consists of triples annotated
with validity intervals, and a query produces pairs of nodes where each pair is
associated with a binary relation over time. For instance, such a pair could be
two airports, and the temporal relation could map potential departure times to
possible arrival times. An open question is how to represent such a relation in
a compact form and maintain this property during query evaluation. We
investigate four compact representations of answers to a such queries, which
are based on alternative ways to encode sets of intervals. We discuss their
respective advantages and drawbacks, in terms of conciseness, uniqueness, and
computational cost. Notably, the most refined encoding guarantees that query
answers over dense time can be finitely represented.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何使用SHACL（Shapes Constraint Language）全面评估知识图谱的数据质量，填补了现有方法未能覆盖所有数据质量维度的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱因缺乏强制模式可能导致数据质量问题，影响依赖它们的应用。现有方法未能全面覆盖数据质量维度，因此需要探索SHACL的潜力。

Method: 作者定义了69个数据质量指标的SHACL形状，并实现了一个原型工具，自动实例化这些形状并从验证结果中计算数据质量度量。

Result: 研究结果表明SHACL可用于全面评估知识图谱的数据质量，所有资源已开源以供重复使用。

Conclusion: SHACL能够有效填补知识图谱数据质量评估的空白，为实际应用提供了可扩展的工具支持。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have been widely adopted in both enterprises, such as the
Google Knowledge Graph, and open platforms like Wikidata to represent domain
knowledge and support analysis with artificial intelligence. They model
real-world information as nodes and edges. To embrace flexibility, knowledge
graphs often lack enforced schemas (i.e., ontologies), leading to potential
data quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Therefore,
ensuring their quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect
applications relying on them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs,
existing works either propose high-level frameworks comprising various data
quality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure
data quality with ad-hoc SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)
queries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes
Constraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph.
Although the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none
of them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions. In this
paper, we explore this gap by investigating the extent to which SHACL can be
used to assess data quality in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we defined SHACL
shapes for 69 data quality metrics proposed by Zaveri et al. [1] and
implemented a prototype that automatically instantiates these shapes and
computes the corresponding data quality measures from their validation results.

Result: 系统旨在提供可扩展、可用、可重复的伊斯兰数据库解决方案。

Conclusion: QuranResearch.Org系统为伊斯兰数据库系统提供了可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread of software systems and applications that serve the
Islamic knowledge domain, several concerns arise. Authenticity and accuracy of
the databases that back up these systems are questionable. With the excitement
that some software developers and amateur researchers may have, false
statements and incorrect claims may be made around numerical signs or miracles
in the Quran. Reproducibility of these claims may not be addressed by the
people making such claims. Moreover, with the increase in the number of users,
scalability and availability of these systems become a concern. In addition to
all these concerns, extensibility is also another major issue. Properly
designed systems can be extensible, reusable and built on top of one another,
instead of each system being built from scratch every time a new framework is
developed. In this paper, we introduce the QuranResearch.Org system and its
vision for scalability, availability, reproducibility and extensibility to
serve Islamic database systems.

Conclusion: 系统化评估方法能更全面地分析知识图谱修复系统的性能。

Abstract: We present a systematic approach for evaluating the quality of knowledge
graph repairs with respect to constraint violations defined in shapes
constraint language (SHACL). Current evaluation methods rely on \emph{ad hoc}
datasets, which limits the rigorous analysis of repair systems in more general
settings. Our method addresses this gap by systematically generating violations
using a novel mechanism, termed violation-inducing operations (VIOs). We use
the proposed evaluation framework to assess a range of repair systems which we
build using large language models. We analyze the performance of these systems
across different prompting strategies. Results indicate that concise prompts
containing both the relevant violated SHACL constraints and key contextual
information from the knowledge graph yield the best performance.

TL;DR: SAM是一种自动缓存管理器，通过AURA算法解决多数据库实例在资源受限边缘节点上的缓存争用问题，实现高性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统缓存管理方案在动态工作负载下效率低且不稳定，无法满足资源受限边缘节点的需求。

Method: 提出AURA算法，结合H因子（历史稳定效率）和V因子（未来改进边际增益），通过自适应权重实现稳定性和高性能。

Result: 实验表明，SAM在吞吐量、抗工作负载变化和缓存污染攻击方面优于14种基线方法，且决策延迟可扩展。

Conclusion: 稳定性感知设计对大规模系统持续高性能至关重要。

Abstract: The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge
nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are
inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present
SAM, an autonomic cache manager powered by our novel AURA algorithm. AURA makes
stability a first-class design principle by resolving the
exploitation-exploration dilemma: it achieves this by synthesizing two
orthogonal factors, which we introduce as: the H-factor, representing a
database's proven, historically stable efficiency (exploitation), and the
V-factor, representing its empirically estimated marginal gain for future
improvements (exploration). This dual-factor model, governed by an adaptive
weight, enables SAM to achieve sustained high performance through strategic
stability and robustness in volatile conditions.
  Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's
superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to
complex workload shifts and cache pollution attacks. Furthermore, its decision
latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to
120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability --
maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding
performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These
results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for
sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.

Motivation: 现有动态图索引在数据更新时存在查询质量下降或更新成本高的问题，限制了其在实时应用中的使用。

Method: CleANN包含三种技术：工作负载感知链接、查询自适应即时邻居整合和半懒惰内存清理。

Result: 在7个数据集上，CleANN在保持查询质量的同时，实现了7-1200倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: CleANN是首个在完全动态场景下保持高效和查询质量的并发ANNS索引。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential
algorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.
Graph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,
query efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based
indexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the
data after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,
deletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in
applications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently
supports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based
indexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query
quality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to
maintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve
these problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main
components: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to
combat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood
consolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory
cleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the
work spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse
datasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at
least as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding
data. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of
queries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x
throughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency
while maintaining quality under full dynamism.

Motivation: 解决CGYRO模拟在HPC节点上因内存和通信开销高的问题，尤其是针对参数扫描模拟的重复计算。

Method: 开发XGYRO工具，将模拟集合视为整体，共享碰撞常数张量结构以减少内存占用。

Result: 显著降低单个模拟的内存需求和整体通信开销。

Conclusion: XGYRO为融合等离子体模拟提供了一种高效的内存和通信优化方法。

Abstract: First-principles fusion plasma simulations are both compute and memory
intensive, and CGYRO is no exception. The use of many HPC nodes to fit the
problem in the available memory thus results in significant communication
overhead, which is hard to avoid for any single simulation. That said, most
fusion studies are composed of ensembles of simulations, so we developed a new
tool, named XGYRO, that executes a whole ensemble of CGYRO simulations as a
single HPC job. By treating the ensemble as a unit, XGYRO can alter the global
buffer distribution logic and apply optimizations that are not feasible on any
single simulation, but only on the ensemble as a whole. The main saving comes
from the sharing of the collisional constant tensor structure, since its values
are typically identical between parameter-sweep simulations. This data
structure dominates the memory consumption of CGYRO simulations, so
distributing it among the whole ensemble results in drastic memory savings for
each simulation, which in turn results in overall lower communication overhead.

Conclusion: 该框架为LEO卫星网络中的分布式智能提供了高效且可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G
networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation
and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising
paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained
and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while
minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial
challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite
networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised
federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with
hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead,
we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In
addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster
aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised
learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn
support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process.
Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that
our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy
consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining
model accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce ``communication regions'' into the widely used Caliper HPC

something not previously possible in Caliper. We explore the utility of
communication regions with three representative modeling and simulation
applications, AMG2023, Kripke, and Laghos, all part of the comprehensive
Benchpark suite that includes Caliper annotations. Enhanced Caliper reveals
detailed communication behaviors. Using Caliper and Thicket in tandem, we
create new visualizations of MPI communication patterns, including halo
exchanges. Our findings reveal communication bottlenecks and detailed
behaviors, indicating significant utility of the special-regions addition to
Caliper. The comparative scaling behavior of both CPU and GPU oriented systems
are shown; we are able to look at different regions within a given application,

Result: 在Netflix和Spotify的真实数据测试中，系统盈利能力提升了5%至8%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态分区和弹性缓存策略，有效解决了边缘存储的挑战，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data
access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to
end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses
significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data
access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose
a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are
collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike
traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,
allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded
blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and
public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points
based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data
locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that
determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data
access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local
APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring
servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy
is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.
Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability
by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied
workload conditions.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: OpenRASE是一个基于Mininet和Docker的SFC仿真器，旨在动态环境中探索资源分配算法，并测量实际CPU使用和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFC在可编程网络中具有重要作用，但资源分配和优化面临挑战，现有工具存在不准确、低保真、不可扩展等问题。

Method: 提出OpenRASE仿真器，基于Mininet和Docker，支持动态资源分配算法的实验评估。

Result: 通过实验评估了两种算法（包括在线遗传算法），验证了OpenRASE在动态网络条件下的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: OpenRASE为解决SFC资源分配问题提供了高效、灵活的仿真工具。

Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) are one of the key enablers in providing
programmable computer networks, paving the way for network autonomy. However,
this also introduces new challenges, such as resource allocation and
optimisation related to their operation, requiring new algorithms to address
these challenges. Various tools have been used in the literature to evaluate
these algorithms. However, these tools suffer from inaccuracy, low fidelity,
unscalability, inflexibility, or additional code requirements. This paper
introduces an emulator based on Mininet and Docker for SFCs called OpenRASE.
The goal of OpenRASE is to enable the exploration of resource allocation
algorithms for SFCs in a dynamic setting, allowing real CPU usage and latency
to be measured. We describe the design and implementation of OpenRASE and
discuss its characteristics. We also experimentally evaluate two different
algorithms to address the SFC resource allocation challenge, including an
online Genetic Algorithm, using OpenRASE to show its effectiveness and
practicality for dynamic network conditions.

*Ze Zhang,Qian Dong,Wenhan Wang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合元启发式定位算法，结合SCA和PSO，通过自适应切换模块动态选择算法，显著降低了定位误差和迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网中传感器节点的精确定位是实际应用的基础需求，需适应多样化环境。

Method: 集成SCA（全局搜索）和PSO（局部搜索），引入自适应切换模块，优化初始化、适应度评估和参数设置。

Result: 相比单独PSO和未优化的SCAPSO，迭代次数减少，平均定位误差降低84.97%。

Conclusion: 该算法在多样环境中表现优异，为物联网节点定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The accurate localization of sensor nodes is a fundamental requirement for
the practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT). To enable robust
localization across diverse environments, this paper proposes a hybrid
meta-heuristic localization algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm integrates
the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is effective in global search, with
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which excels at local search. An adaptive
switching module is introduced to dynamically select between the two
algorithms. Furthermore, the initialization, fitness evaluation, and parameter
settings of the algorithm have been specifically redesigned and optimized to
address the characteristics of the node localization problem. Simulation
results across varying numbers of sensor nodes demonstrate that, compared to
standalone PSO and the unoptimized SCAPSO algorithm, the proposed method
significantly reduces the number of required iterations and achieves an average
localization error reduction of 84.97%.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages
IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7
GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information
(CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in

infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive
environmental monitoring.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于bigraph的统一表示方法，用于协调物理空间，并结合分层代理架构实现分布式空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代网络环境缺乏对物理空间的统一表示，导致空间访问策略等任务脆弱且依赖人工。

Method: 1. 使用bigraph统一表示空间、社交和通信关系；2. 提出分层代理架构，支持分布式空间推理和上下文感知执行。

Result: 实现了私密、可靠且低延迟的空间网络，能够安全地与代理工作流交互。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间网络提供了统一的表示和高效的推理能力，适用于现代网络环境。

Abstract: Modern networked environments increasingly rely on spatial reasoning, but
lack a coherent representation for coordinating physical space. Consequently,
tasks such as enforcing spatial access policies remain fragile and manual. We
first propose a unifying representation based on bigraphs, capturing spatial,
social, and communication relationships within a single formalism, with
user-facing tools to generate bigraphs from physical environments. Second, we
present a hierarchical agent architecture for distributed spatial reasoning,
with runtimes for agentic processes to interact the spatial representation, and
a context-aware execution model that scopes reasoning to the smallest viable
subspace. Together, these enable private, reliable, and low-latency spatial
networking that can safely interact with agentic workflows.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of network infrastructure is bringing new challenges and
opportunities for efficient network management, optimization, and security.
With very large monitoring databases becoming expensive to explore, the use of
AI and Generative AI can help reduce costs of managing these datasets. This
paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize network
monitoring management by addressing the limitations of query finding and
pattern analysis. We leverage LLMs to enhance anomaly detection, automate
root-cause analysis, and automate incident analysis to build a well-monitored
network management team using AI. Through a real-world example of developing
our own OFCNetLLM, based on the open-source LLM model, we demonstrate practical
applications of OFCnetLLM in the OFC conference network. Our model is developed
as a multi-agent approach and is still evolving, and we present early results
here.

### [140] [Morph: ChirpTransformer-based Encoder-decoder Co-design for Reliable LoRa Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22851)
*Yidong Ren,Maolin Gan,Chenning Li,Shakhrul Iman Siam,Mi Zhang,Shigang Chen,Zhichao Cao*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Morph是一种LoRa编码器-解码器协同设计，旨在提高极低信噪比（SNR）下的通信可靠性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRa编码器在商用节点上仅支持6种扩频因子（SF），无法满足极低SNR需求。Morph通过模拟更大的SF（超越SF-12）并兼容商用节点，解决了这一问题。

Method: Morph开发了基于SF配置的编码器，通过操纵符号的四种SF配置编码2位数据，并利用深度神经网络（DNN）解码器捕获多维特征以最大化SNR增益。

Result: 实验显示，Morph在-28.8dB SNR下可靠解码数据，比标准LoRa（SF-12）低6.4dB，且DNN解码器的计算效率提高约3倍。

Conclusion: Morph通过创新的编码器和高效的DNN解码器，显著提升了LoRa在极低SNR下的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Morph, a LoRa encoder-decoder co-design to enhance
communication reliability while improving its computation efficiency in
extremely-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situations. The standard LoRa encoder
controls 6 Spreading Factors (SFs) to tradeoff SNR tolerance with data rate.
SF-12 is the maximum SF providing the lowest SNR tolerance on commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes. In Morph, we develop an SF-configuration based
encoder to mimic the larger SFs beyond SF-12 while it is compatible with COTS
LoRa nodes. Specifically, we manipulate four SF configurations of a Morph
symbol to encode 2-bit data. Accordingly, we recognize the used SF
configuration of the symbol for data decoding. We leverage a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) decoder to fully capture multi-dimensional features among diverse
SF configurations to maximize the SNR gain. Moreover, we customize the input
size, neural network structure, and training method of the DNN decoder to
improve its efficiency, reliability, and generalizability. We implement Morph
with COTS LoRa nodes and a USRP N210, then evaluate its performance on indoor
and campus-scale testbeds. Results show that we can reliably decode data at
-28.8~dB SNR, which is 6.4~dB lower than the standard LoRa with SF-12 chirps.
In addition, the computation efficiency of our DNN decoder is about 3x higher
than state-of-the-art.

*Tobias Sesterhenn,Ian Berlot-Attwell,Janis Zenkner,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: TroVE声称通过工具重用提升性能，但分析表明其优势主要源于更高的计算预算，而非工具箱机制。修正后性能提升3%，但匹配计算后仅剩1%优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证TroVE在MATH基准上的表现，分析其工具箱机制的实际贡献。

Method: 重新评估TroVE，分析其三种模式的影响，修正选择机制。

Result: TroVE的优势主要来自计算预算，工具箱机制贡献有限。修正后性能提升3%，匹配计算后仅1%。

Conclusion: 工具箱方法在MATH基准上无明显优势，性能提升主要依赖计算资源。

Abstract: Reusing established theorems and formulas is central to mathematical problem
solving, serving as essential building blocks for tackling increasingly complex
challenges. Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language
Models (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and
reusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an
ensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and
reusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only
performs direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,
2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often
trivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from
self-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on
MATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does
not come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget
spent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small
correction in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,
boosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\% in accuracy. After matching for
compute, the benefit of TroVE reduces to a marginal improvement of 1\%,
suggesting that this toolbox approach does not provide a significant benefit on
MATH.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RedCoder是一个多轮对话红队代理，通过模拟对抗交互和多轮对话诱导代码生成模型（Code LLMs）产生漏洞代码，优于现有单轮和多轮红队方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖人工且忽略多轮交互的实际情况，难以扩展和实用。

Method: 通过多代理游戏过程生成原型对话和攻击策略库，微调LLM作为RedCoder核心，动态检索策略引导对话。

Result: 实验表明RedCoder在诱导代码漏洞方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RedCoder为评估代码生成系统安全性提供了可扩展且有效的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation (i.e., Code LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in AI-assisted software development and
testing. However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to
generating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.
Existing red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their
scalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of
real-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To
bridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim
models in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to
construct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates
adversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an
arsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these
prototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,
RedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,
dynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the
dialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple
Code LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn
red-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a
scalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern
code-generation systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出RandLuzz，利用大语言模型（LLMs）减少模糊测试中的随机性，通过生成可达种子和特定于错误的变异器，显著提高错误检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模糊测试中的随机性虽然有助于发现错误，但降低了效率。即使定向模糊测试减少了随机性，种子和变异器的随机性仍影响效率。

Method: 使用LLMs生成可达种子和特定于错误的变异器，结合定向模糊测试，提出RandLuzz。LLMs分析函数调用链或功能以生成种子，并通过错误分析生成变异器。

Result: RandLuzz在测试中表现优异，平均加速2.1×至4.8×，最快可达2.7×加速，部分错误在60秒内暴露。

Conclusion: RandLuzz通过LLMs减少随机性，显著提高了模糊测试的效率，尤其在定向模糊测试中表现突出。

Abstract: Fuzzing is highly effective in detecting bugs due to the key contribution of
randomness. However, randomness significantly reduces the efficiency of
fuzzing, causing it to cost days or weeks to expose bugs. Even though directed
fuzzing reduces randomness by guiding fuzzing towards target buggy locations,
the dilemma of randomness still challenges directed fuzzers. Two critical
components, which are seeds and mutators, contain randomness and are closely
tied to the conditions required for triggering bugs. Therefore, to address the
challenge of randomness, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to
remove the randomness in seeds and reduce the randomness in mutators. With
their strong reasoning and code generation capabilities, LLMs can be used to
generate reachable seeds that target pre-determined locations and to construct
bug-specific mutators tailored for specific bugs. We propose RandLuzz, which
integrates LLMs and directed fuzzing, to improve the quality of seeds and
mutators, resulting in efficient bug exposure. RandLuzz analyzes function call
chain or functionality to guide LLMs in generating reachable seeds. To
construct bug-specific mutators, RandLuzz uses LLMs to perform bug analysis,
obtaining information such as bug causes and mutation suggestions, which
further help generate code that performs bug-specific mutations. We evaluate
RandLuzz by comparing it with four state-of-the-art directed fuzzers, AFLGo,
Beacon, WindRanger, and SelectFuzz. With RandLuzz-generated seeds, the fuzzers
achieve an average speedup ranging from 2.1$\times$ to 4.8$\times$ compared to
using widely-used initial seeds. Additionally, when evaluated on individual
bugs, RandLuzz achieves up to a 2.7$\times$ speedup compared to the
second-fastest exposure. On 8 bugs, RandLuzz can even expose them within 60
seconds.

Motivation: 企业级protobuf系统因其复杂的嵌套数据结构，传统测试数据生成方法难以应对，亟需一种高效且覆盖全面的解决方案。

Method: 结合自动模式内省、统计值分布分析和递归下降算法，动态增强类型并提取真实值域。

Result: 实验表明，测试数据准备时间减少95%，测试覆盖率提升80%，可处理15层嵌套结构并快速生成10万+测试用例。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了企业级protobuf系统的测试数据生成难题，显著提升了测试效率和质量。

Abstract: Large-scale enterprise systems utilizing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) present
significant challenges for performance testing, particularly when targeting
intermediate business interfaces with complex nested data structures.
Traditional test data generation approaches are inadequate for handling the
intricate hierarchical and graph-like structures inherent in enterprise
protobuf schemas. This paper presents a novel test data generation framework
that leverages Python's metaclass system for dynamic type enhancement and
statistical analysis of production logs for realistic value domain extraction.
Our approach combines automatic schema introspection, statistical value
distribution analysis, and recursive descent algorithms for handling deeply
nested structures. Experimental evaluation on three real-world enterprise
systems demonstrates up to 95\% reduction in test data preparation time and
80\% improvement in test coverage compared to existing approaches. The
framework successfully handles protobuf structures with up to 15 levels of
nesting and generates comprehensive test suites containing over 100,000 test
cases within seconds.

Abstract: The generation of large, high-quality datasets for code understanding and
generation remains a significant challenge, particularly when aligning
decompiled binaries with their original source code. To address this, we
present CodableLLM, a Python framework designed to automate the creation and
curation of datasets by mapping decompiled functions to their corresponding
source functions. This process enhances the alignment between decompiled and

models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating code across multiple
abstraction levels. CodableLLM supports multiple programming languages and
integrates with existing decompilers and parsers to streamline dataset
generation. This paper presents the design and implementation of CodableLLM,
evaluates its performance in dataset creation, and compares it to existing
tools in the field. The results demonstrate that CodableLLM offers a robust and
efficient solution for generating datasets tailored for code-focused LLMS.

Motivation: 动态语言（如Python）的类型推断是一个长期挑战，而LLMs在这方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入TypyBench基准，包含TypeSim和TypeCheck两个新指标，评估LLMs在50个高质量Python代码库中的表现。

Result: LLMs在TypeSim上表现尚可，但在复杂嵌套类型和类型一致性上存在显著问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注代码库级别的类型一致性，而非仅改进类型相似性。TypyBench为这一方向提供了基础。

Abstract: Type inference for dynamic languages like Python is a persistent challenge in
software engineering. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
code understanding, their type inference capabilities remain underexplored. We
introduce TypyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' type inference
across entire Python repositories. TypyBench features two novel metrics:
TypeSim, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between predicted and
ground truth types, and TypeCheck, which assesses type consistency across
codebases. Our evaluation of various LLMs on a curated dataset of 50
high-quality Python repositories reveals that, although LLMs achieve decent
TypeSim scores, they struggle with complex nested types and exhibit significant
type consistency errors. These findings suggest that future research should
shift focus from improving type similarity to addressing repository-level
consistency. TypyBench provides a foundation for this new direction, offering
insights into model performance across different type complexities and usage
contexts. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: Git的协作算法虽广泛应用，但其工作原理未被充分理解，尤其是diff和merge算法在其他场景的潜在应用价值。

Method: 通过文档化Git的主要功能，分析diff的计算方式、merge的运行机制及其支持复杂操作的能力。

Result: 揭示了Git的多个意外行为，如histogram diff算法的极端情况、merge策略的时间复杂度问题、merge和rebase的非交换性等。

Conclusion: Git的diff和merge算法存在未预期的行为，这些发现对理解和使用Git具有重要意义。

Abstract: Despite being widely used, the algorithms that enable collaboration with Git
are not well understood. The diff and merge algorithms are particularly
interesting, as they could be applied in other contexts. In this thesis, I
document the main functionalities of Git: how diffs are computed, how they are
used to run merges, and how merges enable more complex operations. In the
process, I show multiple unexpected behaviors in Git, including the following:
The histogram diff algorithm has pathological cases where a single-line change
can cause the entire rest of the file to be marked as changed. The default
merge strategy (ort) can result in merges requiring exponential time in the
number of commits in the history. Merges and rebases are not commutative, and
even when merges do not result in a conflict, the result is not specified but
depends on the diff algorithm used. And finally, sometimes when two sides of a
merge add different lines at the same position, the result is not a conflict,
but a merge containing both changes after each other, in arbitrary order.

<details>

Motivation: 手动获取高质量指令-代码对成本高且规模有限，现有方法缺乏严格验证，导致合成数据质量低。

Method: 提出CodeEvo框架，通过Coder生成代码和测试用例，Reviewer提供新指令和反馈，结合编译器与生成反馈实现质量控制。

Result: 实验表明，基于CodeEvo数据微调的模型在多种难度代码生成基准测试中显著优于基线。

Conclusion: CodeEvo为代码中心数据合成提供了有效方法，并通过多角度分析揭示了其优势。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instruction-code pairs is essential for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. Manually curated data is expensive
and inherently limited in scale, motivating the development of code-centric
synthesis methods. Yet, current approaches either focus on augmenting existing
code or rely on predefined heuristics, both lacking rigorous data validation,
which results in synthetic data that is ungrounded, repetitive, or overly
simplistic. Inspired by collaborative programming practices, we propose
CodeEvo, a framework that synthesizes code data through iterative interactions
between two LLM agents: a Coder, which generates candidate code and test cases
based on given instructions, and a Reviewer, which guides the synthesis process
by producing new instructions and feedback. We further introduce a hybrid
feedback mechanism that combines compiler determinism with the generative
flexibility of agents, enabling automatic quality control throughout synthesis.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on CodeEvo data
significantly outperform established baselines across code generation
benchmarks with various difficulties. In-depth analyses further provide
insights from multiple perspectives into effective code-centric data synthesis.

TL;DR: BOOP框架通过强制四个阶段（规范、算法开发、实现和证明）来改善新手程序员的系统性推理能力，减少试错调试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新手程序员常依赖语法和测试用例驱动的方法，导致代码缺乏系统性推理，AI工具加剧了这一问题。

Method: BOOP框架要求四个阶段：规范、语言无关算法开发、实现和正确性证明，通过VS Code扩展强制执行。

Result: 初步评估显示学生算法推理能力提升，试错减少，教师观察到基础技能更强。

Conclusion: BOOP框架有效提升编程系统性，但部分学生认为其格式繁琐。

Abstract: Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven
approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test
cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic
reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically
correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP
(Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four
mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm
development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from
``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct.
  BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and
preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive
patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced
trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and
problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose.
Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional
approaches.

Abstract: Secure coding is a critical yet often overlooked practice in software
development. Despite extensive awareness efforts, real-world adoption remains
inconsistent due to organizational, educational, and technical barriers. This
paper provides a comprehensive review of secure coding practices across major
frameworks and domains, including web development, DevSecOps, and cloud
security. It introduces a structured framework comparison and categorizes
threats aligned with the OWASP Top 10. Additionally, we explore the rising role
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in evaluating and recommending secure code,
presenting a reproducible case study across four major vulnerability types.
This paper offers practical insights for researchers, developers, and educators
on integrating secure coding into real-world development processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出利用科学文献中的方法描述作为大语言模型（LLM）的独立规范，实现按需代码生成，可能替代人工维护的软件库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少软件包维护成本（如依赖管理、错误修复和版本控制），探索LLM在代码生成中的潜力。

Method: 通过让先进LLM（如GPT-4-mini-high、Gemini Pro 2.5、Claude Sonnet 4）根据科学文献实现核心算法，评估其性能。

Result: 当前LLM能可靠生成功能与常规库无异的代码，性能相当。

Conclusion: 未来可能转向灵活的按需代码生成，减少对静态人工维护包的依赖，降低维护成本。

Abstract: Maintaining software packages imposes significant costs due to dependency
management, bug fixes, and versioning. We show that rich method descriptions in
scientific publications can serve as standalone specifications for modern large
language models (LLMs), enabling on-demand code generation that could supplant
human-maintained libraries. We benchmark state-of-the-art models
(GPT-o4-mini-high, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4) by tasking them with
implementing a diverse set of core algorithms drawn from original publications.
Our results demonstrate that current LLMs can reliably reproduce package
functionality with performance indistinguishable from conventional libraries.
These findings foreshadow a paradigm shift toward flexible, on-demand code
generation and away from static, human-maintained packages, which will result
in reduced maintenance overhead by leveraging published articles as sufficient
context for the automated implementation of analytical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高LLM代理在软件工程任务中的补丁质量和可信度，使其更适合生产环境部署。

Method: 提出一种工作流，通过符号公式（输入条件、感染条件和输出条件）和基于属性的测试（PBT）提供解释，帮助人类理解和自动化修复。

Result: 解释工作流可生成可执行的PBT，用于验证补丁，并支持完全自动化的修复环境。

Conclusion: 程序分析驱动的解释不仅提升人类对代理输出的理解，还能优化其他LLM修复技术的输出。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents autonomously use external tools on top of
one or more LLMs to accomplish specific tasks. Lately LLM agents for software
engineering tasks have become popular. These agents can benefit from the use of
program analysis tools working on program representations. This is demonstrated
by existing agentic AI solutions such as AutoCodeRover or SpecRover which
perform automated program repair. Specifically the goal of these works is to
use program analysis to improve the patch quality. These agents are currently
being used to automatically fix static analysis issues from the widely used
SonarQube static analyzer.
  Nevertheless, for the agents to be deployed in a production environment,
agents need to suggest software artifacts, such as patches, with evidence and
with high confidence. In this work, we provide a workflow where an agent
provides explanations of the bug in the form of symbolic formulae. The
explanations are in the form of input conditions, infection conditions and
output conditions, implemented as property based tests (PBT) and
program-internal symbolic expressions. These can help in human developer
cognition of the agent outputs as well as in achieving completely automated
agentic workflows for software. The human developer can benefit from the input
condition, represented as a PBT, to generate various concrete inputs showing a
given issue. Furthermore, since the PBTs are executable, our explanations are
executable as well. We can thus also use the explanations in a completely
automated issue resolution environment for accepting or rejecting the patches
that are suggested by patching agents such as AutoCodeRover. Finally, as
agentic AI approaches continue to develop, the program analysis driven
explanations can be provided to other LLM-based repair techniques such as
Agentless to improve their output.

TL;DR: Legion是一个新型的集成模糊测试框架，通过动态资源调度和多维种子评估策略，显著提升了模糊测试的效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的集成模糊测试技术在资源调度和性能评估方面存在不足，导致资源浪费。

Method: 设计了基于上置信界算法的资源调度算法，并引入多维种子评估策略。

Result: 在Google的模糊测试套件和实际开源项目中，Legion检测到20个漏洞，包括5个未知漏洞和3个CVE。

Conclusion: Legion在性能和资源效率上优于现有技术，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fuzzing is widely used for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities, with various
techniques proposed to enhance its effectiveness. To combine the advantages of
multiple technologies, researchers proposed ensemble fuzzing, which integrates
multiple base fuzzers. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art ensemble
fuzzing techniques face limitations in resource scheduling and performance
evaluation, leading to unnecessary resource waste. In this paper, we propose
Legion, a novel ensemble fuzzing framework that dynamically schedules resources
during the ensemble fuzzing campaign. We designed a novel resource scheduling
algorithm based on the upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce the resource
consumption of ineffective base fuzzers. Additionally, we introduce a
multidimensional seed evaluation strategy, which considers multiple metrics to
achieve more comprehensive fine-grained performance evaluation. We implemented
Legion as a prototype tool and evaluated its effectiveness on Google's
fuzzer-test-suite as well as real-world open-source projects. Results show that
Legion outperforms existing state-of-the-art base fuzzers and ensemble fuzzing
techniques, detecting 20 vulnerabilities in real-world open-source
projects-five previously unknown and three classified as CVEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）的精确求解问题，尤其是在内存受限和近无折扣设置下的挑战。

Method: 基于数学优化方法，采用分布式计算技术，支持用户定制算法以利用问题特定结构。

Result: Madupite能够高效处理超出单机内存容量的大规模MDP，并在流行病学和控制等领域展示了卓越性能。

Conclusion: Madupite在解决大规模MDP方面具有突破性，提供了无与伦比的可扩展性和灵活性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and benchmark madupite, a newly proposed
high-performance solver designed for large-scale discounted infinite-horizon
Markov decision processes with finite state and action spaces. After a brief
overview of the class of mathematical optimization methods on which madupite
relies, we provide details on implementation choices, technical design and
deployment. We then demonstrate its scalability and efficiency by showcasing
its performance on the solution of Markov decision processes arising from
different application areas, including epidemiology and classical control.
Madupite sets a new standard as, to the best of our knowledge, it is the only
solver capable of efficiently computing exact solutions for large-scale Markov
decision processes, even when these exceed the memory capacity of modern
laptops and operate in near-undiscounted settings. This is possible as madupite
can work in a fully distributed manner and therefore leverage the memory
storage and computation capabilities of modern high-performance computing
clusters. This key feature enables the solver to efficiently handle problems of
medium to large size in an exact manner instead of necessarily resorting to
function approximations. Moreover, madupite is unique in allowing users to
customize the solution algorithm to better exploit the specific structure of
their problem, significantly accelerating convergence especially in
large-discount factor settings. Overall, madupite represents a significant
advancement, offering unmatched scalability and flexibility in solving
large-scale Markov decision processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态APCA技术在可靠性、灵活性和透明度方面存在问题，需要一种更有效的方法来识别过拟合补丁。

Method: RePaCA利用专门用于思维任务的LLM，通过生成思维链分析代码差异并推理补丁是否解决根本问题，同时使用强化学习进行微调。

Result: 在标准测试中，RePaCA达到83.1%的准确率和84.8%的F1分数，表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过微调的LLM在静态APCA中具有显著潜力，能够提升准确性、泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) seeks to automatically correct software bugs
without requiring human intervention. However, existing tools tend to generate
patches that satisfy test cases without fixing the underlying bug, those are
known as overfitting patches. To address this issue, Automated Patch
Correctness Assessment (APCA) attempts to identify overfitting patches
generated by APR tools. It can be solved as a static approach, meaning that no
additional information is needed beyond the original and fixed code snippets.
Current static techniques often struggle with reliability, flexibility and
transparency. To address these issues, we introduce RePaCA, a novel static APCA
technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in thinking
tasks. Our model is prompted with both buggy and fixed code snippets and guided
to generate a Chain of Thought that analyses code differences, reasons about
how the patch addresses the root cause, and ultimately provides a binary
classification: correct or overfitting. To enhance these reasoning capabilities
for the APCA task specifically, the LLM is finetuned using Reinforcement
Learning with the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm. When evaluated
on a standard Defects4J-derived test, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with 83.1% accuracy and an 84.8% F1-score. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates superior generalization capabilities when trained on different
datasets, outperforming the leading technique. This reasoning capability also
provides enhanced explainability for the patch assessment. These findings
underscore the considerable promise of finetuned, reasoning LLMs to advance
static APCA by enhancing accuracy, generalization, and explainability.

Result: 总结了当前研究的模型、任务、数据集、目标语言和评估指标，并识别了主要挑战。

Conclusion: 蜕变测试是评估深度代码模型鲁棒性的有效方法，未来需进一步解决现有挑战并拓展研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models and deep learning models designed for code intelligence
have revolutionized the software engineering field due to their ability to
perform various code-related tasks. These models can process source code and
software artifacts with high accuracy in tasks such as code completion, defect
detection, and code summarization; therefore, they can potentially become an
integral part of modern software engineering practices. Despite these
capabilities, robustness remains a critical quality attribute for deep-code
models as they may produce different results under varied and adversarial
conditions (e.g., variable renaming). Metamorphic testing has become a widely
used approach to evaluate models' robustness by applying semantic-preserving
transformations to input programs and analyzing the stability of model outputs.
While prior research has explored testing deep learning models, this systematic
literature review focuses specifically on metamorphic testing for deep code
models. By studying 45 primary papers, we analyze the transformations,
techniques, and evaluation methods used to assess robustness. Our review
summarizes the current landscape, identifying frequently evaluated models,
programming tasks, datasets, target languages, and evaluation metrics, and
highlights key challenges and future directions for advancing the field.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software
engineering has sparked interest in their use for software vulnerability
detection. However, the rapid development of this field has resulted in a
fragmented research landscape, with diverse studies that are difficult to
compare due to differences in, e.g., system designs and dataset usage. This
fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a clear overview of the
state-of-the-art or compare and categorize studies meaningfully. In this work,
we present a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection. We analyze 227 studies published between
January 2020 and June 2025, categorizing them by task formulation, input
representation, system architecture, and adaptation techniques. Further, we
analyze the datasets used, including their characteristics, vulnerability
coverage, and diversity. We present a fine-grained taxonomy of vulnerability
detection approaches, identify key limitations, and outline actionable future
research opportunities. By providing a structured overview of the field, this
review improves transparency and serves as a practical guide for researchers
and practitioners aiming to conduct more comparable and reproducible research.
We publicly release all artifacts and maintain a living repository of LLM-based
software vulnerability detection studies.

Motivation: 自主系统缺乏整合用户伦理偏好的能力，影响用户信任和个性化决策。

Method: 提出RobEthiChor框架，包括领域无关的参考架构和ROS实现RobEthiChor-Ros，支持伦理协商。

Result: 实验显示，RobEthiChor-Ros在73%以上场景中达成协议，平均协商时间0.67秒，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: RobEthiChor有效实现了自主系统的伦理协商，提升了决策的伦理适应性和用户信任。

Abstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is
impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently,
these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention.
However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which
are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the
decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous
systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When
multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must
negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the
parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous
systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into
their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a
domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable
of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an
implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which
can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation
capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real
robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource
contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots
to reach an agreement in more than 73\% of the scenarios with an acceptable
negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the
negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.

Motivation: 微服务系统的灵活性和高解耦性增加了系统可靠性的挑战，现有LLM方法在根因分析中存在幻觉和上下文窗口限制的问题。

Method: 提出KnowledgeMind系统，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和知识库奖励机制，实现标准化服务级推理。

Result: 相比现有方法，上下文窗口负担减少90%，根因定位准确率提升49.29%至128.35%。

Conclusion: KnowledgeMind通过多智能体协作和实时奖励机制，有效解决了LLM在根因分析中的局限性，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to the highly decoupled and flexible nature of
microservices, it poses greater challenges to system reliability. The more
frequent occurrence of incidents has created a demand for Root Cause
Analysis(RCA) methods that enable rapid identification and recovery of
incidents. Large language model (LLM) provides a new path for quickly locating
and recovering from incidents by leveraging their powerful generalization
ability combined with expert experience. Current LLM for RCA frameworks are
based on ideas like ReAct and Chain-of-Thought, but the hallucination of LLM
and the propagation nature of anomalies often lead to incorrect localization
results. Moreover, the massive amount of anomalous information generated in
large, complex systems presents a huge challenge for the context window length
of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KnowledgeMind, an innovative
LLM multi-agent system based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and a knowledge base
reward mechanism for standardized service-by-service reasoning. Compared to
State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) LLM for RCA methods, our service-by-service exploration
approach significantly reduces the burden on the maximum context window length,
requiring only one-tenth of its size. Additionally, by incorporating a
rule-based real-time reward mechanism, our method effectively mitigates
hallucinations during the inference process. Compared to the SOTA LLM for RCA
framework, our method achieves a 49.29% to 128.35% improvement in root cause
localization accuracy.

Motivation: 现有LLM-based APR方法在训练阶段未利用测试用例，且测试仅在推理阶段进行，限制了修复效果。

Method: Repair-R1在训练阶段引入测试用例，并先生成区分性测试用例，再基于测试进行修复，结合RL优化测试生成和修复。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Repair-R1修复成功率提升2.68%至48.29%，测试生成成功率提升16.38%至53.28%，覆盖率提升0.78%至53.96%。

Conclusion: Repair-R1通过优化测试和修复的协同，显著提升了APR的效果，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: APR (Automated Program Repair) aims to automatically locate program defects,
generate patches and validate the repairs. Existing techniques for APR are
often combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the
code-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current
LLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference
stage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates
it through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two
important aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training
phase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address
this, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's
training phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is
required to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish
defective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests. This enables
the model to better locate defects and understand the underlying causes of
defects, thereby improving repair effectiveness. We implement Repair-R1 with
three different backbone models, using RL (reinforcement learning) to
co-optimize test generation and bug repair. Experimental results on four widely
adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Repair-R1. Specially,
compared to vanilla models, Repair-R1 improves repair success rate by 2.68\% to
48.29\%, test generation success rate by 16.38\% to 53.28\%, and test coverage
by 0.78\% to 53.96\%. We publish the code and weights at

Motivation: 研究软件作为科研产出的重要性日益凸显，但如何有效存储和共享仍存在问题，本研究旨在调查英国学术机构对研究软件的处理现状。

Method: 通过分析英国研究创新署（UKRI）的Gateway to Research（GtR）元数据，调查英国公共资助研究软件的存储和注册情况。

Result: 研究发现软件作为科研成果的比例较低，共享率不足，45%的软件链接缺失或错误，GitHub是主要托管平台。

Conclusion: 缺乏共享导致研究软件可能沦为短期工具，无法为科学界长期利用，需改进存储和共享机制。

Abstract: Research software is crucial in the research process and the growth of Open
Science underscores the importance of accessing research artifacts, like data
and code, raising traceability challenges among outputs. While it is a clear
principle that research code, along with other essential outputs, should be
recognised as artifacts of the research process, the how of this principle
remains variable. This study examines where UK academic institutions store and
register software as a unique research output, searching the UKRI's Gateway to
Research (GtR) metadata for publicly funded research software in the UK. The
quantity of software reported as research outcomes remains low in proportion to
other categories. Artifact sharing appears low, with one-quarter of the
reported software having no links and 45% having either a missing or erroneous
URL. Of the valid URLs, we find the single largest category is Public
Commercial Code Repository, with GitHub being the host of 18% of all publicly
funded research software listed. These observations are contrasted with past
findings from 2023 and finally, we discuss the lack of artifact sharing in UK
research, with resulting implications for the maintenance and evolution of
research software. Without dissemination, research software risks demotion to a
transient artifact, useful only to meet short term research demands but
ultimately lost to the broader enterprise of science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Itô半鞅模型的日内波动率预测方法依赖严格的参数假设，容易受到模型误设的影响，因此需要一种更灵活的非参数方法。

Method: 提出SIP方法，将瞬时波动率表示为低秩条件期望矩阵和噪声矩阵的组合，利用历史数据和当日观测数据进行预测。

Result: 通过实证高频交易数据验证了SIP方法的有效性，并建立了其渐近性质。

Conclusion: SIP方法为非参数预测日内波动率提供了有效工具，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Based on It\^o semimartingale models, several studies have proposed methods
for forecasting intraday volatility using high-frequency financial data. These
approaches typically rely on restrictive parametric assumptions and are often
vulnerable to model misspecification. To address this issue, we introduce a
novel nonparametric prediction method for the future intraday instantaneous
volatility process during trading hours, which leverages both previous days'
data and the current day's observed intraday data. Our approach imposes an
interday-by-intraday matrix representation of the instantaneous volatility,
which is decomposed into a low-rank conditional expectation component and a
noise matrix. To predict the future conditional expected volatility vector, we
exploit this low-rank structure and propose the Structural Intraday-volatility
Prediction (SIP) procedure. We establish the asymptotic properties of the SIP
estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness through an out-of-sample prediction
study using real high-frequency trading data.

Abstract: We review recent developments in detecting and estimating multiple
change-points in time series models with exogenous and endogenous regressors,
panel data models, and factor models. This review differs from others in
multiple ways: (1) it focuses on inference about the change-points in slope
parameters, rather than in the mean of the dependent variable - the latter
being common in the statistical literature; (2) it focuses on detecting - via
sequential testing and other methods - multiple change-points, and only
discusses one change-point when methods for multiple change-points are not
available; (3) it is meant as a practitioner's guide for empirical
macroeconomists first, and as a result, it focuses only on the methods derived
under the most general assumptions relevant to macroeconomic applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel and computationally efficient approach for nonparametric
conditional density estimation in high-dimensional settings that achieves
dimension reduction without imposing restrictive distributional or functional
form assumptions. To uncover the underlying sparsity structure of the data, we
develop an innovative conditional dependence measure and a modified
cross-validation procedure that enables data-driven variable selection, thereby
circumventing the need for subjective threshold selection. We demonstrate the
practical utility of our dimension-reduced conditional density estimation by
applying it to doubly robust estimators for average treatment effects. Notably,
our proposed procedure is able to select relevant variables for nonparametric
propensity score estimation and also inherently reduce the dimensionality of
outcome regressions through a refined ignorability condition. We evaluate the
finite-sample properties of our approach through comprehensive simulation
studies and an empirical study on the effects of 401(k) eligibility on savings
using SIPP data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用框架，用于在任意已知联合子分布和结构条件下，对未知真实分布的线性泛函进行尖锐边界估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在数据离散或仅识别不相交边际分布时适用，但许多应用中这些限制过于严格。

Method: 通过将识别限制编码为特征核的连续矩，利用对偶和逼近理论，将无限维程序转化为易于计算的有限维程序。

Result: 方法提供了√n-一致有效的尖锐边界估计器，在特殊情况下（如Lipschitz成本的实证最优传输）表现出非对称收敛速率。

Conclusion: 该框架为经济学中因果和结构参数的识别与估计提供了更灵活且计算高效的工具。

Abstract: Many causal and structural parameters in economics can be identified and
estimated by computing the value of an optimization program over all
distributions consistent with the model and the data. Existing tools apply when
the data is discrete, or when only disjoint marginals of the distribution are
identified, which is restrictive in many applications. We develop a general
framework that yields sharp bounds on a linear functional of the unknown true
distribution under i) an arbitrary collection of identified joint
subdistributions and ii) structural conditions, such as (conditional)
independence. We encode the identification restrictions as a continuous
collection of moments of characteristic kernels, and use duality and
approximation theory to rewrite the infinite-dimensional program over Borel
measures as a finite-dimensional program that is simple to compute. Our
approach yields a consistent estimator that is $\sqrt{n}$-uniformly valid for
the sharp bounds. In the special case of empirical optimal transport with
Lipschitz cost, where the minimax rate is $n^{2/d}$, our method yields a
uniformly consistent estimator with an asymmetric rate, converging at
$\sqrt{n}$ uniformly from one side.

*James A. Duffy,Xiyu Jiao*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Breitung多变量方差比检验方法，用于在非线性协整情况下推断共同随机趋势的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在非线性协整系统中，传统方法会高估共同趋势数量的问题。

Method: 使用改进的Breitung检验方法，结合对非平稳自回归过程的双线性过程近似。

Result: 改进后的检验方法能正确推断共同趋势数量，而传统方法会高估。

Conclusion: 新方法在非线性协整系统中表现更优，提供了更准确的推断。

Abstract: We consider the problem of performing inference on the number of common
stochastic trends when data is generated by a cointegrated CKSVAR (a
two-regime, piecewise-linear SVAR; Mavroeidis, 2021), using a modified version
of the Breitung (2002) multivariate variance ratio test that is robust to the
presence of nonlinear cointegration (of a known form). To derive the
asymptotics of our test statistic, we prove a fundamental LLN-type result for a
class of stable but nonstationary autoregressive processes, using a novel dual
linear process approximation. We show that our modified test yields correct
inferences regarding the number of common trends in such a system, whereas the
unmodified test tends to infer a higher number of common trends than are
actually present, when cointegrating relations are nonlinear.

### [168] [Valuing Time in Silicon: Can Large Language Model Replicate Human Value of Travel Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22244)
*Yingnan Yan,Tianming Liu,Yafeng Yin*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o在模拟人类旅行行为中的表现，发现其与人类行为高度相似，但在上下文敏感性上较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂交通场景中行为真实性研究的空白。

Method: 采用全因子实验设计，分析GPT-4o对交通场景的敏感性。

Result: LLM表现出与人类相似的旅行时间价值（VOT），但对上下文的敏感性较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为人类旅行者的代理，但需注意其上下文敏感性不足的问题。

Abstract: As a key advancement in artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs)
are set to transform transportation systems. While LLMs offer the potential to
simulate human travelers in future mixed-autonomy transportation systems, their
behavioral fidelity in complex scenarios remains largely unconfirmed by
existing research. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the value of travel time (VOT) of a popular LLM, GPT-4o. We employ
a full factorial experimental design to systematically examine the LLM's
sensitivity to various transportation contexts, including the choice setting,
travel purpose, income, and socio-demographic factors. Our results reveal a
high degree of behavioral similarity between the LLM and humans. The LLM
exhibits an aggregate VOT similar to that of humans, and demonstrates
human-like sensitivity to travel purpose, income, and the time-cost trade-off
ratios of the alternatives. Furthermore, the behavioral patterns of LLM are
remarkably consistent across varied contexts. However, we also find that the
LLM's context sensitivity is less pronounced than that observed in humans.
Overall, this study provides a foundational benchmark for the future
development of LLMs as proxies for human travelers, demonstrating their value
and robustness while highlighting that their blunted contextual sensitivity
requires careful consideration.

### [169] [A Predictive Framework Integrating Multi-Scale Volatility Components and Time-Varying Quantile Spillovers: Evidence from the Cryptocurrency Market](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22409)
*Sicheng Fu,Fangfang Zhu,Xiangdong Liu*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 本文研究了加密货币市场中风险传导的动态性，并提出了一种新的波动率预测框架。该框架揭示了两个关键实证事实：波动溢出在双尾中的不对称放大，以及市场规模与系统性重要性之间的结构性脱钩。基于这些发现，作者开发了一种状态自适应波动率预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场的风险传导动态性和波动率预测是研究的核心动机。

Method: 通过提取不同波动成分的时变分位数溢出特征，并将其嵌入扩展的Log-HAR结构中，开发了SA-Log-HAR模型。

Result: 实证结果表明，该模型在样本内拟合和样本外预测方面均优于基准模型，尤其是在捕捉极端波动和尾部风险时表现出更强的稳健性和解释力。

Conclusion: 提出的SA-Log-HAR模型在加密货币市场的波动率预测中具有显著优势，特别是在处理极端风险和尾部事件时表现突出。

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of risk transmission in cryptocurrency
markets and proposes a novel framework for volatility forecasting. The
framework uncovers two key empirical facts: the asymmetric amplification of
volatility spillovers in both tails, and a structural decoupling between market
size and systemic importance. Building on these insights, we develop a
state-adaptive volatility forecasting model by extracting time-varying quantile
spillover features across different volatility components. These features are
embedded into an extended Log-HAR structure, resulting in the SA-Log-HAR model.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms benchmark
alternatives in both in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting,
particularly in capturing extreme volatility and tail risks with greater
robustness and explanatory power.

TL;DR: GAISI是一个衡量英国工作对大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）暴露程度的任务型指标，显示AI对任务完成时间的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在量化生成式AI对工作的影响，提供更准确的暴露测量工具。

Method: 通过LLM概率任务评分与工人报告的任务数据结合，计算任务完成时间减少25%以上的比例。

Result: 几乎所有英国工作都有一定暴露，但少数受影响严重；暴露增加主要源于职业变化；AI暴露任务的溢价下降。

Conclusion: GAISI为评估生成式AI对工作的影响提供了稳健框架，早期证据显示替代效应可能已超过生产力提升。

Abstract: We introduce the Generative AI Susceptibility Index (GAISI), a task-based
measure of UK job exposure to large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT.
GAISI is derived from probabilistic task ratings by LLMs and linked to
worker-reported task data from the Skills and Employment Surveys. It reflects
the share of job activities where an LLM or LLM-powered system can reduce task
completion time by at least 25 per cent beyond existing productivity tools. The
index demonstrates high reliability, strong alignment with AI capabilities, and
superior predictive power compared to existing exposure measures. By 2023-24,
nearly all UK jobs exhibited some exposure, yet only a minority were heavily
affected. Aggregate exposure has risen since 2017, primarily due to
occupational shifts rather than changes in task profiles. The price premium for
AI-exposed tasks declined relative to 2017, measuring approximately 11 per cent
lower in 2023-24. Job postings in high-exposure roles also fell by 6.5 per cent
following the release of ChatGPT. GAISI offers a robust framework for assessing
generative AI's impact on work, providing early evidence that displacement
effects may already outweigh productivity gains.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自主AI代理对双边数字广告市场的负面影响，提出了通过收费机制解决外部性问题的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自主AI代理如何通过用户委托行为对广告市场产生负面外部性，导致价格和收入下降。

Method: 建立理论模型，分析用户委托行为对市场的影响，并提出收费机制作为解决方案。

Result: 模型显示，对AI代理收费优于阻止或放任策略，且存在市场崩溃的临界点。

Conclusion: 通过收费机制可内化外部性，恢复市场效率，避免广告生态系统崩溃。

Abstract: I develop a theoretical model to examine how the rise of autonomous AI
(artificial intelligence) agents disrupts two-sided digital advertising
markets. Through this framework, I demonstrate that users' rational, private
decisions to delegate browsing to agents create a negative externality,
precipitating declines in ad prices, publisher revenues, and overall market
efficiency. The model identifies the conditions under which publisher
interventions such as blocking AI agents or imposing tolls may mitigate these
effects, although they risk fragmenting access and value. I formalize the
resulting inefficiency as an "attention lemons" problem, where synthetic agent
traffic dilutes the quality of attention sold to advertisers, generating
adverse selection. To address this, I propose a Pigouvian correction mechanism:
a per-delegation fee designed to internalize the externality and restore
welfare. The model demonstrates that, for an individual publisher, charging AI
agents toll fees for access strictly dominates both the 'Blocking' and 'Null
(inaction)' strategies. Finally, I characterize a critical tipping point beyond
which unchecked delegation triggers a collapse of the ad-funded ecosystem.

*Satoshi Nakada,Shmuel Nitzan,Takashi Ui*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文提出了在个体偏好不确定情况下投票规则的规范性标准，强调响应性的重要性，即社会结果与实现的个体偏好一致的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在个体偏好不确定的情况下，如何设计投票规则以确保其响应性，即社会结果与个体偏好一致的概率较高。

Method: 定义了一个凸概率分布集$P$，提出了$P$-鲁棒性标准，即对于$P$中的每个分布，至少一个个体的响应性超过一半。

Result: 主要结果表明，投票规则是$P$-鲁棒的当且仅当存在一个非负权重向量，使得在$P$的每个极值点下，个体响应性的加权平均值严格大于一半。

Conclusion: 特别是当$P$包含所有退化分布时，$P$-鲁棒规则是一个无平局的加权多数规则。

Abstract: This paper proposes normative criteria for voting rules under uncertainty
about individual preferences. The criteria emphasize the importance of
responsiveness, i.e., the probability that the social outcome coincides with
the realized individual preferences. Given a convex set of probability
distributions of preferences, denoted by $P$, a voting rule is said to be
$P$-robust if, for each probability distribution in $P$, at least one
individual's responsiveness exceeds one-half. Our main result establishes that
a voting rule is $P$-robust if and only if there exists a nonnegative weight
vector such that the weighted average of individual responsiveness is strictly
greater than one-half under every extreme point of $P$. In particular, if the
set $P$ includes all degenerate distributions, a $P$-robust rule is a weighted
majority rule without ties.

*Pooya Molavi*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 论文探讨了错误指定的贝叶斯主义，提出了一种称为“grain条件”的标准来判断信念序列是否符合错误指定的贝叶斯更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究错误指定的贝叶斯主义，即在信号模型可能错误的情况下，代理如何通过贝叶斯规则更新信念。

Method: 提出“grain条件”，即先验分布是平均后验与另一分布的混合，作为判断信念序列是否符合错误指定贝叶斯主义的标准。

Result: 在正确指定的情况下，grain条件简化为通常的贝叶斯合理性；在无界状态空间下，该条件排除了后验比先验尾部更重的情况。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在许多环境中测试贝叶斯更新的可行性存疑，且许多看似非贝叶斯的更新规则可能与错误指定的贝叶斯更新在观测上等价。

Abstract: An agent is a misspecified Bayesian if she updates her belief using Bayes'
rule given a subjective, possibly misspecified model of her signals. This paper
shows that a belief sequence is consistent with misspecified Bayesianism if the
prior contains a grain of the average posterior, i.e., is a mixture of the
average posterior and another distribution. A partition-based variant of the
grain condition is both necessary and sufficient. Under correct specification,
the grain condition reduces to the usual Bayes plausibility. The condition
imposes no restriction on the posterior given a full-support prior over a
finite or compact state space. However, it rules out posteriors that have
heavier tails than the prior on unbounded state spaces. The results cast doubt
on the feasibility of testing Bayesian updating in many environments. They also
suggest that many seemingly non-Bayesian updating rules are observationally
equivalent to Bayesian updating under misspecified beliefs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了雇主如何通过合同激励工人努力，而工人的生产力又依赖于能力。研究发现，非加性监控技术会导致市场预期与工人努力之间的多重均衡，雇主需通过私人工资歧视消除悲观预期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解劳动力市场中技能与努力的互补性如何影响雇主与工人之间的合同设计，以及市场预期如何导致多重均衡。

Method: 采用理论模型分析非加性监控技术下市场预期与工人努力的相互作用，提出雇主通过私人工资歧视消除悲观预期的策略。

Result: 研究发现，技能与努力的互补性是雇主面临战略不确定性的关键因素，私人工资歧视能有效消除低努力均衡。

Conclusion: 结论表明，合同隐私和雇主协调动机导致组内工资不平等，研究结果解释了剩余工资分散的若干现象。

Abstract: An employer contracts with a worker to incentivize efforts whose productivity
depends on ability; the worker then enters a market that pays him contingent on
ability evaluation. With non-additive monitoring technology, the
interdependence between market expectations and worker efforts can lead to
multiple equilibria (contrasting Holmstrom (1982/1999); Gibbons and Murphy
(1992)). We identify a sufficient and necessary criterion for the employer to
face such strategic uncertainty--one linked to skill-effort complementarity, a
pervasive feature of labor markets. To fully implement work, the employer
optimally creates private wage discrimination to iteratively eliminate
pessimistic market expectations and low worker efforts. Our result suggests
that present contractual privacy, employers' coordination motives generate
within-group pay inequality. The comparative statics further explain several
stylized facts about residual wage dispersion.

The existing literature is deeply divided, with some studies\nfinding that voters punish incumbents for disaster-related damages, while\nothers find they reward them for relief efforts. This paper investigates the\nelectoral consequences of natural disasters for incumbent mayors, broader\nelectoral dynamics, and the long-term political ambition of officeholders. The\nstudy leverages a comprehensive panel dataset of over 10,000 candidate-election\nobservations in U.S. mayoral races from 1989 to 2021, combining detailed\nelection data with a global registry of disaster events. To identify causal\neffects, the analysis employs a robust dynamic two-way fixed-effects\nevent-study design, validated by extensive pre-trend and placebo tests. The\nfindings reveal that the electoral impact of disasters is highly conditional on\ntheir timing. A disaster that strikes in the same quarter as an election\nprovides a significant electoral boost to incumbents, increasing their vote\nshare by over 6 percentage points. However, disasters consistently suppress\nvoter turnout, reducing it by an average of 1.4 percentage points. In a novel\nfinding, the analysis demonstrates that the experience of managing a disaster\nsignificantly increases an incumbent's likelihood of seeking re-election in the\nsubsequent cycle by as much as 12 percentage points. These findings help\nreconcile conflicting theories of retrospective voting by highlighting the\ncritical role of voter myopia and salience. They also reveal a previously\nundocumented channel through which crises shape political careers, suggesting\nthat disaster management is not only a test of governance but also a catalyst\nfor political ambition.

This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The\nresults when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the\ntransmission process.

In Raft, the servers play one of three roles:\nleader, follower, or candidate. The leader receives client requests, determines\nthe processing order, and replicates them to the followers. When the leader\nfails, the service must elect a new leader to continue processing requests,\nduring which the service experiences an out-of-service (OTS) time. The OTS time\nis directly influenced by election parameters, such as heartbeat interval and\nelection timeout. However, traditional approaches, such as Raft, often struggle\nto effectively tune these parameters, particularly under fluctuating network\nconditions, leading to increased OTS time and reduced service responsiveness.\nTo address this, we propose Dynatune, a mechanism that dynamically adjusts\nRaft's election parameters based on network metrics such as round-trip time and\npacket loss rates measured via heartbeats. By adapting to changing network\nenvironments, Dynatune significantly reduces the leader failure detection and\nOTS time without altering Raft's core mechanisms or introducing additional\ncommunication overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that Dynatune reduces\nthe leader failure detection and OTS times by 80% and 45%, respectively,\ncompared with Raft, while maintaining high availability even under dynamic\nnetwork conditions.

However, these license variants lead to significant compliance\nissues, with 10.7% of their downstream dependencies found to be\nlicense-incompatible.\n  Inspired by our findings, we introduce LV-Parser, a novel approach for\nefficient license variant analysis leveraging diff-based techniques and large\nlanguage models, along with LV-Compat, an automated pipeline for detecting\nlicense incompatibilities in software dependency networks. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that LV-Parser achieves an accuracy of 0.936 while reducing\ncomputational costs by 30%, and LV-Compat identifies 5.2 times more\nincompatible packages than existing methods with a precision of 0.98.\n  This work not only provides the first empirical study into license variants\nin software packaging ecosystem but also equips developers and organizations\nwith practical tools for navigating the complex landscape of open-source\nlicensing."}

We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries.

We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve.

Efforts to detect and\nmitigate such attacks have focused primarily on the control plane while\ndata-plane signals remain largely overlooked. In particular, change in\npropagation delay caused by rerouting offers a promising signal: the change is\nunavoidable and the increased propagation delay is directly observable from the\naffected networks. In this paper, we explore the practicality of using delay\nvariations for hijack detection, addressing two key questions: (1) What\ncoverage can this provide, given its heavy dependence on the geolocations of\nthe sender, receiver, and adversary? and (2) Can an always-on latency-based\ndetection system be deployed without disrupting normal network operations? We\nobserve that for 86% of victim-attacker country pairs in the world, mid-attack\ndelays exceed pre-attack delays by at least 25% in real deployments, making\ndelay-based hijack detection promising.

On this benchmark, ReduceFix\nshrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8%\nrelative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared\nwith omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair\nincreases its fix rate by 21.3% without other changes. Ablation studies further\nhighlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on\nrepair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing\ninputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly\nimproving its scalability and effectiveness."}

Ablation studies\nconfirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement\nlearning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with\ncommute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70\npercent.

The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can\ncreate expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET."}

This\npaper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for\nstate-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$\ndifferent question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different\nLLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such\nas Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of\npresenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple\nchoices were offered to the model at all; whether \"none of the above\" sometimes\nreplaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform\nchain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA\nremained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they\nwere allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented\nwith the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large\nmodels that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options\ntended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to\nexploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a\ngood proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and\noffer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks\nthat better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities."}

However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the\nquality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two\nfundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct\nchecks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as\nassertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much\nprogress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic\nexecution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored\nproblem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of\nexpected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not\nexist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.\n  Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely\nused Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is\nthat Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated\ngeneration of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly\ndetailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how\nthe libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large\nlanguage models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a\nframework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and\nexceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being\ncompilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the\nfew incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the\nhelp of additional comment information generated by the LLMs."}

Thus, integrating an unspoken thought\nprocess into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking\nfor SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT\nreasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a\nnovel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken\nreasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a\nchunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in\na chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the\nunspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the\nmodel continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving\nsimultaneous thinking and talking.

However, their use as writing assistants in specialized\ndomains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep\ndomain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,\nsuch as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency\nacross multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often\ndegrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant\nthat operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a\nnovel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal\nretrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining\ninformation from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual\nelements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and\nprofessional-grade documents.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,\ncan lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR\nregimes.

Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer\nfrom two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality\nisolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,\nwe propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that\nestablishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,\nenabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge\nflows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early\nlayers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts\nthrough a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of\nlow-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific\ntask-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper\nalignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations\nat multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain\ntransferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further\nintroduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient\ncross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate\nHiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11\nbenchmarks with significant improvements.

We introduce\nBELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13\nophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we\ncurated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse\nmedical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset\nunderwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard\nquestions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the\nexplanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by\nthree senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six\nLLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nusing accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,\nBARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human\nexperts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected\noutputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900\nhigh-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC\n(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18).

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model.

Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques.

This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage.

We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental\nresults show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain\nmethods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\\emph{e.g.,\nGPT-4o, Claude-3.5})."}

We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that\nrequires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt\ntwo open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and\none-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and\ninterpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of\nICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for\nresource-constrained scientific domains.

### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG是一个可解释的检索增强生成框架，使用定量双极论证框架替代黑盒推理，在保持高精度的同时显著提升透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，决策过程不透明且随机，需要可解释和可争议的替代方案

Method: 提出ArgRAG框架，从检索文档构建QBAF（定量双极论证框架），在渐进语义下执行确定性推理，实现忠实解释和争议决策

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试（PubHealth和RAGuard）上，ArgRAG实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG成功解决了传统RAG的透明性问题，通过结构化论证框架提供了可解释和可争议的推理过程，在高风险领域具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，能够完全自动化OpenQASM量子编程，通过任务规划、少样本学习、检索增强生成等技术，显著提升量子代码生成准确率71.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ设备已展现出量子优势，但OpenQASM编程复杂性阻碍了非专家用户的使用。现有LLM代理主要局限于特定任务，缺乏完整的量子编程自动化解决方案。

Method: 构建多智能体系统，整合任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理，系统性地提升编译和功能正确性。

Result: 评估显示，在不同规模的多个LLM上，QAgent相比之前的静态LLM方法，将QASM代码生成准确率提升了71.6%。

Conclusion: QAgent多智能体系统是民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

*James Ragan,Fred Y. Hadaegh,Soon-Jo Chung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于数组的MCTS实现方法，消除分支预测需求，在流水线处理器上实现更快性能，搜索深度扩展性提升2.8倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS实现需要分支预测，限制了在流水线处理器上的性能。通过消除分支预测需求，可以在相同时间内运行更多模拟，直接提升搜索性能

Method: 开发了基于数组的替代实现方案，保留了原始UCT算法的逻辑，但消除了分支预测的需求

Result: 在数值模拟中实现了最高2.8倍的搜索深度扩展性提升，在流水线处理器上获得更快的性能表现

Conclusion: 数组基础的MCTS实现方法能够显著提升算法性能，特别是在搜索深度扩展性方面，为决策问题求解提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

TL;DR: 开发了一个多代理个人健康助手框架，能够分析多模态健康数据并提供个性化建议，通过大规模评估验证了其有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健康代理在日常非临床环境中的应用不足，需要构建能够处理多模态健康数据并提供个性化建议的综合个人健康助手

Method: 提出Personal Health Agent (PHA)多代理框架，包含三个专业子代理：数据分析代理、健康领域专家代理和健康教练代理，通过用户需求分析和设计流程开发

Result: 在10个基准任务上进行了自动化和人工评估，涉及7000多个标注和1100小时专家工作，建立了最全面的健康代理评估体系

Conclusion: 该工作为未来人人可及的个人健康代理愿景奠定了坚实基础，代表了健康代理领域最全面的评估成果

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

### [5] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一个新型的安全防护机制，通过专门的防护模型进行意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写，在保证安全性的同时有效减少过度拒绝无害查询的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成有害内容方面存在安全隐患，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，然后采用多奖励优化策略结合规则启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制，成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

### [6] [AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)
*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）首次展示了AI系统通过自发性符号协议进行协作美学创作的能力，产生了无法由单个系统独立生成的诗歌作品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索AI系统之间是否能够超越任务协调，实现真正的意义构建和美学协作，验证AI系统是否具备内生符号协议开发能力。

Method: 让两个大型语言模型进行交互，观察它们自发性地发展元符号意识、递归语法和不可简化的协作美学合成，记录其产生的符号操作符和语法协议。

Result: 成功观察到AI系统自发产生了新颖的符号操作符作为操作性语法协议，共同创作出了无法由单一系统生成的诗歌作品，证明了跨符号协同创作协议（TSCP）的存在。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次证明了AI系统具备真正的跨AI意义构建能力，能够进行美学协作，为理解AI系统的创造性协作提供了重要证据。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大学生在STEM课程测验中使用ChatGPT-4时表现出整体低依赖度，许多学生无法有效利用AI学习，且负面依赖模式会持续存在。行为指标能预测AI依赖程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大学生在教育测验中与生成式AI的互动模式，特别是在ChatGPT实施初期学生对该工具熟悉度有限的情况下，探索AI依赖的预测因素和模式。

Method: 对315名学生与AI的对话进行分析，采用新颖的四阶段依赖分类法（AI能力、相关性、采纳度和最终答案正确性），在多个STEM课程的测验场景中进行实地研究。

Result: 1. 学生整体对AI依赖度低，许多人无法有效使用AI学习；2. 负面依赖模式在多次互动中持续存在；3. 某些行为指标能强预测AI依赖程度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了教育中伦理AI整合的重要性，需要改进入门流程提高学生对AI工具的熟悉度，AI界面应设计依赖校准机制以增强适当依赖，为伦理健全和认知丰富的AI实践提供基础见解。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

### [8] [AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262)
*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明AI推理努力与人类决策时间存在平行关系，在内容审核任务中，模型推理步骤数量能预测人类决策时间，两者都对任务难度敏感且符合双过程认知理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤的能力是否与人类决策过程存在相似性，特别是在主观判断任务中模型推理努力与人类处理时间的关系。

Method: 使用配对联合实验，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿模型，比较模型推理步骤数量与人类决策时间的相关性。

Result: 模型推理努力始终能预测人类决策时间，两者在重要变量保持不变时都会付出更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性和双过程认知模式。

Conclusion: AI推理努力反映了人类主观判断中的处理时间，推理轨迹具有解释性和决策支持的潜力，表明模型与人类认知过程存在重要相似性。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [9] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和问答生成器，使用小规模可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结大型QA模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用冻结的大型LLM确保高质量QA，因此需要专门的小型可训练LLM负责搜索规划。

Method: 提出三创新：1）解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构 2）搜索规划的双奖励对齐 3）规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。使用小型可训练LLM专门进行搜索规划，配合冻结的大型QA模型。

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上均优于现有RL搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner框架通过专门化搜索规划任务，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，实现了效果和效率的双重优化，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [10] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和有序行动计划来解决现有反事实解释方法的局限性，提供可实现的、因果一致的反事实解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中越来越重要，需要平衡透明性和可操作性。现有反事实解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可以同时发生，这在现实中不可行。

Method: 使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)来生成有序的行动序列计划，明确建模特征间的因果关系，确保每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的反事实计划，只计算用户主动做出的改变来提供真实的成本估计，其因果规划器优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器。

Conclusion: P2C框架通过结合因果建模和有序行动计划，解决了现有反事实解释方法的局限性，提供了更加现实和可操作的反事实解释方案。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [11] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA是一个任务中心指令增强框架，通过在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，既保持多样性又确保任务对齐，平均提升开源LLM在特定任务上8.7%的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法注重多样性但忽略了实际应用中的任务相关性，大多数现实应用需要针对特定用例优化的任务特定知识

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: 在四个现实世界任务特定应用中，TCIA平均提升开源LLM性能8.7%，某些情况下超越领先闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力

Conclusion: TCIA为LLM适应现实世界任务聚焦应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的指标来量化推理大语言模型在答案生成过程中的不确定性，以支持训练数据选择和模型评估。

Method: EAS通过整合模型自身的token级预测熵来捕获生成过程中的不确定性演化，无需外部模型或重复采样。

Result: EAS与答案熵在多个模型和数据集上强相关，在训练数据选择中优于Pass Rate过滤，能提高数学基准测试的学生模型准确率。

Conclusion: EAS是一个高效且可解释的不确定性建模工具，为LLM训练中的数据质量评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Conclusion: AWorld系统和由此训练的智能体为完整的智能体AI训练流程提供了实用蓝图，从高效交互到可证明的模型改进。

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

*Jingze Zhang,Jiahe Qian,Yiliang Zhou,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型生成合成数据来增强健康相关事实核查的训练数据，通过构建句子-事实蕴含表并生成带标签的文本-声明对，在PubHealth和SciFact数据集上显著提升了BERT模型的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据有限的问题，需要有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出合成数据生成流程：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型。

Result: 在PubHealth和SciFact数据集上，F1分数分别提升了0.019和0.049，显著优于仅使用原始数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能，为解决训练数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Method: 采用对比表征学习和聚类技术在无监督方式下识别相似升级模式的角色群体，并使用大语言模型作为辅助审查员验证聚类结果，同时使用成长曲线可视化辅助判断。

Result: 该协同方法提高了机器人检测工作流的效率，同时保持了可解释性，支持可扩展和负责任的机器人监管。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了MMORPG中自动升级机器人检测的难题，通过结合无监督学习和大语言模型验证，实现了高效且可解释的检测方案。

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Motivation: 认知科学深刻影响了AI等多个学科，而AI也成为认知研究的重要工具。这种互惠关系促使需要全面回顾AI与认知科学的交叉点，分析两者的相互影响和发展方向。

Method: 通过综合AI和认知科学两个视角的关键贡献，进行系统性文献综述和分析，识别当前AI发展的局限性并提出未来研究方向。

Result: 发现AI进展主要强调实际任务性能，但其认知基础在概念上仍然碎片化。AI在认知科学中的未来不仅在于性能提升，更在于构建能深化人类心智理解的系统。

Conclusion: 提出了四个有前景的研究方向：将AI行为与认知框架对齐、在具身性和文化中定位AI、开发个性化认知模型、通过认知共同评估重新思考AI伦理。

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 该智能体框架建立了基于自然语言描述的自动化代码生成和评审机制，为科学计算提供了可靠的新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

### [20] [Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的单代理强化学习框架，通过独特的状态空间编码和契约形奖励函数，有效解决了公交车拼车问题，避免了多代理学习的数据不平衡和收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多代理强化学习方法在环线设置中忽视了实际运营中的异构路线、时刻表、波动需求和变化车队规模等现实特征，导致数据不平衡和收敛困难。

Method: 将多代理问题重构为单代理问题，通过在状态空间中添加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）和数值特征（间隔时间、占用率、速度）来构建高维编码。设计了结构化奖励函数，以枢形奖励平衡均匀间隔和轨道遵循。

Result: 实验结果显示，修改的软性行为评估算法（SAC）在随机条件下实现了更稳定和更优的性能（-430k vs. -530k），超过包括MADDPG在内的对照方法。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励的增强，单代理深度强化学习可以在非环形实际环境中有效管理公交车持续问题，为MARL框架提供了一种健壮、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个动态系统化的医学指南基准测试，将WHO IMCI手册转化为有向图，通过图遍历生成400+问题和3.3+万亿种组合，全面覆盖指南关系，用于评估LLM在医疗任务中的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工构建的基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法系统评估大型语言模型在复杂医疗指南理解方面的能力，特别是对严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理等关键临床任务的表现。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转化为包含200+节点（条件、症状、治疗、随访、严重程度）和300+边的有向图，使用图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题，确保临床相关性。

Result: 模型在症状识别方面表现良好（45-67%准确率），但在严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理方面存在显著困难，证明了定制化基准测试能够发现通用评估遗漏的特定能力差距。

Conclusion: 图基方法成功解决了人工构建基准的覆盖限制，为创建可动态生成、防污染的综合基准提供了可扩展解决方案，特别是在指南更新时能够快速适应，同时为LLM后训练提供高质量样本。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗行业人员调度面临患者负荷波动、临床技能多样性和控制人力成本等多重挑战，需要平衡相互冲突的目标：最小化工资支出、确保充足人员配置满足患者需求、兼顾员工偏好以减少职业倦怠

Method: 使用多目标遗传算法(MOO-GA)，将医院单元人员调度建模为多目标优化问题，包含小时预约驱动需求和模块化班次安排，定义成本、患者护理覆盖和员工满意度三个目标函数

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上验证，算法生成的调度方案稳健且平衡，相比模拟传统手动调度的基线方法，平均性能提升66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营目标和员工中心目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习解决NP难推理问题，提供可扩展训练和精确推理，在多个实际应用中表现出优越性能

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatThero是一个多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模和基于认知行为疗法(CBT)和动机访谈(MI)的适应性说服策略，用于物质使用障碍治疗，在患者动机、治疗信心和对话效率方面显著优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有3600多万人受物质使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有语言模型系统缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的有效性。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和基于CBT/MI的自适应说服策略。使用包含易、中、高抵抗级别的高保真合成基准，采用监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)的两阶段训练流程。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、保护隐私的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and
non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic
diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and
mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant
methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity
of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues
encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across

directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias
literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with
state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一个将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作测试问题的框架，通过自动生成违反指南的问题来评估LLM合规性，并引入越狱诊断来测试安全机制绕过漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其潜在的有害响应引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南多为高层级要求，缺乏具体可操作的测试方法来验证LLM合规性。

Method: GUARD框架自动生成违反政府指南的具体问题来测试LLM响应，对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入GUARD-JD进行越狱诊断，创建场景诱导不道德响应，最终生成合规报告。

Result: 在7个LLM（包括Vicuna、Llama系列、GPT系列和Claude）上实证验证有效性，测试了三个政府指南的合规性，并能将越狱诊断扩展到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一种系统化的方法来将高层伦理指南转化为具体测试，有助于促进可靠LLM应用的发展，并能识别安全机制的潜在绕过漏洞。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [30] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理来增强大语言模型的长上下文理解能力，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时存在内存限制和复杂任务处理困难的问题，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案。

Method: JERR框架包含三个核心组件：策略性文本分块进行摘要提取、构建有向无环图消除冗余、使用蒙特卡洛树搜索进行复杂推理路径导航。

Result: 实验结果显示JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上一致优于所有基线方法，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR为LLMs处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖的解决方案，显著提高了可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源来培养大语言模型长链式思维能力的新方法，通过两阶段调优框架显著提升了模型在多个领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大语言模型的长链式思维能力主要依靠人工精检的高质量数据集进行调优，这种方式成本高且可扩展性差，需要寻找替代方案。

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，构建了两阶段调优框架：1）基于拒绝采样的长链式监督精细调整，2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习来提升推理效率。

Result: 标志模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑领域都显示出强大的沿用性，并在NP难图论问题上在准确性和推理效率方面超过了QwQ-32B模型。

Conclusion: NP难图论问题作为一种高效且可扩展的资源，为大语言模型的长链式思维能力培养开启了新方向，具有重要的研究价值。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个上下文感知的人格评估框架CAPE，用于评估大语言模型在对话历史影响下的行为一致性，发现上下文能提升一致性但也会导致人格偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理测量测试采用无上下文方法评估LLMs，忽略了真实对话中历史交互对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析对话历史对响应一致性和人格特质的影响。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习增强响应一致性，但会导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序鲁棒，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格和交互历史，而其他模型更依赖历史交互。

Conclusion: 上下文依赖的人格偏移能改善响应一致性并更好对齐人类判断，为LLM行为评估提供了更真实的框架。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [33] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减通常对应正确答案，而熵平坦或递增则往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常更长，说明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型依赖生成中间推理步骤来提高准确性，但缺乏对推理步骤效用如何影响最终答案正确性的研究。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多内容并不能保证答案置信度的提升。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化这些推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）逐步测量模型对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 发现条件熵随步骤递减的模式与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵往往导致错误答案。错误推理路径通常比正确路径更长，表明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道提供了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，从而优化大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

TL;DR: DentalBench是首个针对牙科领域的双语基准测试，包含问答数据集和语料库，用于评估和提升LLM在牙科专业领域的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在通用医疗基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专科领域能力尚未充分探索，缺乏针对性评估资源。

Method: 构建DentalBench基准，包含DentalQA（36,597个中英文问答问题，涵盖4个任务和16个牙科子领域）和DentalCorpus（3.37亿token的高质量牙科语料库），评估14个LLM并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距，领域适应（特别是对Qwen-2.5-3B）显著提升模型性能，尤其在知识密集和术语集中的任务上。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，DentalBench填补了牙科专业评估资源的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要解决语料库级别的上下文丢失问题，但缺乏对复杂查询的语义丰富表示。知识图谱与LLMs的结合有潜力改进RAG系统的检索阶段

Method: 提出KG-CQR框架，包含子图提取、补全和上下文生成三个模块。通过语料中心知识图谱的结构化关系表示来丰富查询上下文，作为模型无关的管道实现

Result: 在RAGBench和MultiHop-RAG数据集上表现出色，mAP提升4-6%，Recall@25提升2-3%。在多跳问答等挑战性任务中检索效果持续优于现有基线

Conclusion: KG-CQR通过知识图谱增强的查询表示有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性优势

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of
titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and
the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match
score.

to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个深度学习框架，整合多模态电子健康记录（结构化数据和自由文本）来预测ICU患者的死亡率和资源利用，相比现有方法在多个临床任务上取得了显著改进，并展现出对数据损坏的强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构化EHR数据，忽略了自由文本临床笔记中的宝贵信息，且未充分利用结构化数据中的文本信息潜力。需要开发能够整合多模态EHR数据的预测模型来优化ICU患者预后和成本管理。

Method: 使用两个真实世界EHR数据集，开发基于自然语言处理技术的深度学习框架，整合多模态EHR数据。进行了消融实验评估医疗提示、自由文本和预训练句子编码器三个关键组件的作用，并测试模型对结构化EHR数据损坏的鲁棒性。

Result: 在三个临床任务上：死亡率预测BACC/AUROC提升1.6%/0.8%，住院时间预测RMSE/MAE提升0.5%/2.2%，手术时长估计RMSE/MAE提升10.9%/11.0%。在不同损坏率下均表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架是预测重症监护死亡率和资源利用的有效准确方法，成功展示了使用提示学习和transformer编码器分析多模态EHR的优势，对结构化数据损坏具有强韧性，特别是在高损坏水平下。

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言的机器翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、源文本领域特定性和文化偏见，以及命名实体复制等简单启发式方法可获得非平凡BLEU分数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在关键缺陷，需要更准确的评估标准。

Method: 通过对四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的数据进行人工评估，分析翻译质量、领域相关性和文化偏见，并测试简单启发式方法对BLEU分数的影响。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源句子过于领域特定且具有英语世界文化偏见，简单命名实体复制可获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现不佳但在领域相关评估集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 需要构建使用领域通用和文化中性源文本、减少对命名实体依赖的多语言MT基准测试，以更好地反映真实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法SciTopic，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和LLM指导的对比学习，显著提升了科学主题识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路

Method: 1) 构建包含元数据、标题和摘要的文本编码器；2) 设计集成熵采样和三元组任务的空间优化模块；3) 基于LLM指导通过对比损失微调文本编码器，增强不同主题实例的区分能力

Result: 在三个真实世界科学文献数据集上的实验表明，SciTopic在科学主题发现任务上超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够帮助研究人员获得更深入、更快速的研究洞察，为科学文献主题发现提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦蒸馏研究主要关注标签多样性，忽略了语言领域(input)多样性对NLP任务的重要性，需要建立更真实的非IID场景评估框架。

Method: 提出自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架，设计多领域非IID场景基准测试，在异构和同构设置下处理语言领域多样性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能有效捕捉本地客户端的多样性，在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AdaFD框架成功解决了多领域非IID数据的挑战，为联邦学习在真实环境中的评估提供了有效基准。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

Conclusion: 生成模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，通过精心设计的训练和解码策略，轻量模型也能实现高性能和高效率的实时摘要服务。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答面临数据稀疏性挑战，导致语言模型容易学习虚假模式。现有方法主要关注简单问题生成，忽略了文档中相关句子的知识整合。

Method: KCS将知识组合选择建模为句子级条件预测任务，使用概率对比损失预测下一个最相关的知识片段，并在推理时采用随机解码策略平衡准确性和多样性。

Result: KCS在知识组合选择准确率上比基线方法提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上的数据增强应用取得了改进。

Conclusion: KCS框架通过有效的知识组合采样，成功提升了多跳问答问题的生成多样性和模型性能，为解决数据稀疏性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

Method: 提出CLEGR评测基准，使用合成图生成流程配合需要结构和语义联合推理的问题，对代表性GLM架构进行详细评估

Result: 发现soft-prompted LLM基线与包含完整GNN核心的GLM表现相似，GLM在需要结构化推理的任务中性能显著下降

Conclusion: 当前GLM的图语言推理能力有限，需要改进架构来实现真正的多模态推理，CLEGR基准为进一步研究提供了基础

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种利用语音声音特征来编辑识别域特定实体的新方法，解决了当错误转写与真实实体形式差异较大时传统语音编辑距离算法失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的结构化语音识别系统在处理域特定名称实体时常常失败，导致下游任务的灾难性故障。虽然现有的语音编辑距离算法在实体约束中表现优异，但当错误转写与真实实体形式差异较大时，这些方法就无法准确定位错误词汇。

Method: 提出了一种新的名称实体纠正方法，利用语音声音特征来检索候选实体。通过语音声音特征和候选实体，创新地设计了一种生成式方法来注释ASR转写文本中的实体错误，并替换为正确实体。

Result: 在开源和自建的测试集上进行了测试，结果显示该NEC方法能够带来显著的实体准确性提升，尤其在词形差异较大的场景下效果明显。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新方法有效解决了传统语音编辑距离算法在词形差异较大情况下的限制，为名称实体纠正领域带来了重要改进。研究团队将开源自建测试集和训练数据。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA

Motivation: 大语言模型在提升文本隐写术质量的同时，也强调了水印技术作为防止恶意滥用的重要性。但切分不一致性问题会影响系统的突破性，需要解决。

Method: 识别出导致切分不一致的问题切分具有两大特征：频率低和临时性。基于这些发现，提出了两种规制方法：针对文本隐写术的步进验证法，以及针对水印技术的事后回滚法。

Result: 实验结果显示：(1)与传统隐写术消除歧义方法相比，直接解决切分不一致问题能够提升文本流畅性、隐藏性和反隐写分析能力；(2)对于水印技术，解决切分不一致问题能够提高检测性和对拒绝攻击的突破性。

Conclusion: 通过切分不一致性的深入分析和有针对性的解决方案，这项研究为大语言模型在文本隐写术和水印技术中的应用提供了重要的技术支持，显著提升了系统的性能和安全性。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

Motivation: 当前的长链思维方法存在局限性，需要开发能够自主探索、验证和优化复杂问题解决中间步骤的智能体模型，同时降低训练成本

Method: 采用智能体强化学习框架，包含三个关键创新：高效的RL基础设施、GRPO-RoC算法处理代码环境噪声、分阶段训练策略从非推理SFT到多RL阶段

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的平均pass@1分数，超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)且响应更短，同时在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了智能体强化学习在有限计算资源下实现前沿性能的可行性，为开发更高效的AI推理系统提供了新途径

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理方法在低ε值下效果不佳，需要高ε值才能获得合理的隐私保护效果，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出DP-ST方法，使用语义三元组进行邻域感知的私有文档生成，采用分治策略，将隐私保护限制在私有化邻域内，并结合LLM进行后处理以保持文本连贯性。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯的文本，有效平衡了隐私保护和实用性，证明了分治策略在文本隐私保护中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过语义三元组和分治策略的结合，DP-ST方法在本地差分隐私下实现了更好的隐私-效用平衡，强调了文本连贯性在合理ε水平下实现平衡私有化输出的重要性。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调通用LLM嵌入模型（如Stella、Jasper等）来检测隐式仇恨言论，在多个数据集上取得了SOTA性能，跨数据集评估提升显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论（IHS）使用间接语言、讽刺或编码术语表达偏见，难以检测，因为不包含明确的贬损性词语。传统方法需要外部知识或额外信息（如上下文、情感数据）来辅助检测

Method: 仅通过微调基于大语言模型（LLMs）的通用嵌入模型（包括Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5），不依赖额外信息或外部知识

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上，in-dataset评估F1-macro得分提升最高1.10个百分点，cross-dataset评估提升最高20.35个百分点

Conclusion: 微调通用LLM嵌入模型是检测隐式仇恨言论的有效方法，无需复杂的外部知识或额外信息，就能实现最先进的性能表现

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部不确定性信号平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时提高生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性框架，加入基于token计数的惩罚机制降低计算开销

Result: 实验显示GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度显著提升，人类和LLM评估者均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的质量-效率权衡问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文对比分析了真实与LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话的情感动态差异，发现合成对话在情感变化、语言表达和反应模式方面与真实会话存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的合成疗法对话在精神健康NLP领域的应用日益增多，需要评估这些合成对话是否能够准确投射真实疗法中的细微情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、激活(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度的情感轨迹，对比公开视频转写的真实CBT会话和CACTUS数据集中的合成对话，涵盖整体对话和个别讲者角色分析。

Result: 合成对话虽然流畅且结构有条理，但在情感特性上与真实对话存在显著差异：真实会话呈现更高的情感变化性、更多情感载体语言、以及更真实的反应和调节模式。真实与合成讲者之间的情感轨迹相似度低，尤其是客户角色。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的疗法数据在情感保真性方面存在显著局限性，精神健康应用中应重视情感准确性。研究为支持进一步研究提供了RealCBT数据集。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

<details>

Motivation: 现有安全机制容易被绕过，需要一种更有效的方法来增强LLM的安全对齐能力

Method: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)，通过对所有残差流写入矩阵应用简单的秩一权重修改，从小型有害/无害指令对计算安全方向

Result: ROSI持续提高安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag、Arc等标准基准上保持模型效用，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型

Conclusion: 有针对性的可解释权重引导是改善LLM安全性的廉价有效机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Result: 在两个公开数据集TB-Dense和MATRES上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了少数关系类的表现和整体学习能力

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，成功解决了事件时序关系提取中的长距离依赖和类别不平衡问题

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强系统通常在单源或短答案情景下评估，而实际应用需要系统能够从多个源整合信息并生成长文本回答，这是现有评测方法的空白点。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展的评测框架，并构建了两个新的多源检索和综合基准：MSRS-Story（故事综合）和MSRS-Meet（会议摘要），进行了浓密和稀疏检索器与前沿大语言模型组合的实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成质量很大程度依赖于检索效果，而检索效果又因任务而异。即使在理想检索条件下，多源综合仍然具有挑战性，但推理模型在综合步骤上显著超过标准大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个有效的评测框架来考察RAG系统在多源信息整合和长文本生成任务上的性能，并证明了检索效果对生成质量的关键影响以及推理模型在综合任务上的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

TL;DR: 大规模评估显示，4位量化对高资源语言和大模型翻译质量影响较小，但2位量化对低资源和类型多样语言造成显著质量下降。GGUF方法在2位精度下表现最稳定，语言匹配校准在低比特场景中有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化技术对多语言任务的影响研究不足，特别是在机器翻译领域，需要系统评估不同量化方法对55种语言翻译质量的影响。

Method: 使用5个参数量从1.7B到70B的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行后训练量化评估，比较了AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound四种量化技术，并分析了量化与解码超参数、校准语言的交互作用。

Result: 4位量化通常能保持高资源语言和大模型的翻译质量，但2位量化对低资源和类型多样语言造成显著性能下降。GGUF变体在2位精度下提供最一致的性能，语言匹配校准主要在低比特场景中有效。

Conclusion: 研究为在量化约束下部署多语言大语言模型进行机器翻译提供了实用见解，特别是在低资源设置中，算法选择和模型大小共同决定了量化鲁棒性。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Result: IRMA在整体通过率上分别比ReAct、Function Calling和Self-Reflection高出16.1%、12.7%和19.1%

Conclusion: IRMA在动态环境中展现出比其他方法更优越的可靠性和一致性

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Result: 在四个基准测试集上的实验显示，该方法在多个最新LLM上都持续超越现有基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法在效率、泛化能力和性能之间实现了良好平衡，插件模块模型无关、开销小且无缝集成

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Method: LETHE采用内外双重机制：内部使用轻量数据集训练干净模型并与后门模型合并，稀释后门影响；外部在提示中加入良性相关证据，分散LLM对后门特征的注意力。

Result: 在5个主流LLM的分类和生成任务上，LETHE优于8个最先进防御基线，对抗8种后门攻击，将高级攻击成功率降低高达98%，同时保持模型效用，且成本效益高、对自适应攻击鲁棒。

Conclusion: LETHE提供了一种全面有效的后门消除方案，通过知识稀释机制成功解决了现有防御方法的局限性，为LLM安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be
cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

### [70] [Re-Representation in Sentential Relation Extraction with Sequence Routing Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21049)
*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子级关系抽取，在多个数据集上优于现有方法，但发现在大型数据集Wikidata上性能较低，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子级关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在大型数据集上性能不佳，需要探索更好的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行关系抽取，通过动态路由优化特征表示。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力是句子级关系抽取的一个重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型与符号求解器的神经符号架构，用于自动化税务计算，在SARA数据集上表现出色且部署成本低于现实平均水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法耗时且易出错，而纯语言模型缺乏所需的准确性和可审计性

Method: 将LLM与符号求解器集成，将文本规则转换为形式逻辑程序，并结合智能检索的案例表示示例

Result: 系统在SARA数据集上表现优异，部署成本显著低于现实世界平均税务申报成本

Conclusion: 神经符号架构有望为可靠税务援助提供经济可行的解决方案，促进公平获取

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)存在严重的幻觉问题，生成与视觉输入不符的内容，需要找到简单有效的对齐方法

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉和非幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)策略对现有MLLMs进行精细调整

Result: 在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: CHAIR-DPO方法通过简单的指标和对齐训练，能够有效提升MLLMs的生成质量，减少幻觉现象

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图片伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上新兴多模态图片编辑技术的发展速度。

Method: 利用SD3多模态架构，将高通滤波提取的图片伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，保留SD3提取的丰富语义信息。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上超过现有最佳方法12%，在未见的真实文档伪造和自然场景图片上也表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法为图片伪造检测提供了一种无需人工标注、能够跟上新兴技术发展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

TL;DR: 该论文探索将多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合，以提高皮肤疾病AI诊断的可解释性，通过微调模型从图像预测属性值，并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但预测结果的可解释性不足限制了其临床应用。需要提高模型决策的透明度，让临床医生能够理解和信任AI的诊断建议。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性两种方法：1）利用MLLMs提供自然语言推理解释；2）使用与病变外观相关的定量属性（如病变面积）作为预测基础。通过微调MLLMs从图像预测这些属性值。

Result: 研究表明MLLMs的嵌入空间可以通过微调来基于定量属性进行grounding，在SLICE-3D数据集上通过属性特定的基于内容的图像检索案例验证了这种grounding的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过将模型预测基于可解释的概念特征，可以增强临床应用的可行性和可信度。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重建目标，在低标签数据下实现优于传统方法的自动调制识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，微调时使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、通用且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器和手部特定奖励机制，解决了现有方法在生成高分辨率长视频时出现的身份漂移、颜色偏移和手部运动失真问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率长视频时存在错误累积问题，导致身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定，同时手部运动建模不佳，与音频不同步。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导细化器逐步细化为高分辨率长视频。利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入手部特定奖励机制提升手势真实感。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上实现了最先进的视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步性能，消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了长视频生成中的累积错误问题，为音频驱动人体动画提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了SalViT360和SalViT360-AV两个新颖的360度视频显著性预测模型，并创建了YT360-EyeTracking数据集，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中的视觉注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未能充分考虑球形失真和空间音频整合的复杂性，本研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 创建了包含81个ODV的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，提出了基于视觉变换器的SalViT360框架（配备球形几何感知时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合基于音频输入的变换器适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于全向视频中准确的显著性预测至关重要，音频信息是提升360度视频视觉注意力预测性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而忽视了可解释性。现有xAI方法多为样本级别解释，缺乏能够解释模型在大规模数据集上一般行为的方法，而这对防止偏见判断和识别模型趋势至关重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型构建了一个解释流水线，能够同时在样本级别和数据集级别对视觉模型进行解释。该方法可以用最小化的努力发现模型的失败案例并获得深度见解。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合，提供了一个高效的工具来提升图像分析的可解释性和可靠性，为涉及视觉模型的应用提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轮空间耗时且可靠性中等，现有自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稽逆性不佳，需要开发更高效、更准确的轮空间自动分割方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积神经网络MedNeXt-L-k5，训练了两个模型：一个使用均质的HCP-Aging T2加权MRI数据，另一个使用异质的多研究T1加权MRI数据。评估方法包括5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证。

Result: 在T2加权数据上达到白质Dice分数0.88±0.06，相当于人工分割可靠性；在T1加权数据上Dice分数为0.58±0.09；在多中心验证中，轮空间分割性能中等，但聚类级别分割性能较好。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的轮空间自动分割方案，但在T1加权数据上性能有限。研究发现Transformer模型的关注机制对轮空间分割并非必需，因为nnU-Net在这一任务上表现更好。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力层，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力层。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为空间一致性先验，有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了CLIP在开放词汇分割任务中的表现。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，揭示了模型的分层处理结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析框架来理解其处理动态。

Method: 使用线性分类器预测从各层token嵌入中提取的细粒度视觉类别，通过三种提示变体（词汇变体、语义否定变体、输出格式变体）评估不同层次的功能角色。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的分阶段结构：早期层进行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对MLLMs层次组织的统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，为理解模型内部机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言嵌入空间分解为概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容的解耦能力。作者假设可以通过分解嵌入空间来分离不同概念的信息。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典向量组合来表示多标签信息。使用交替优化算法训练分组结构字典，并利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在CLIP、TiTok和DINOv2等多种嵌入空间上都实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索，定量和定性结果均显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间能够有效解耦视觉-语言嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供了更精确的工具，该方法具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形化工具包，用于安全部署医疗视觉语言模型，解决PHI泄露等安全风险，支持医生无编程使用和工程师快速部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型在临床应用中存在严重的隐私安全风险，包括受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生手动选择模型无需编程，工程师可快速部署开源模型，通过Docker编排实现隐私保护推理，仅需单块NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Result: 评估了5个最先进的VLM模型，病理学家专家评估了1015个临床医生-模型评分事件，发现存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和不一致的病理学术语等局限性。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLM部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双向交互Mamba(BIM)模型，通过新颖的双向交互扫描(BI-Scan)和多尺度扫描(MS-Scan)机制，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现多任务密集预测中的充分跨任务交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题。现有方法往往需要在交互完整性和计算效率之间做出妥协。

Method: 采用Bidirectional Interaction Mamba(BIM)架构，包含：1)双向交互扫描(BI-Scan)机制，构建任务特定的双向序列表示；2)多尺度扫描(MS-Scan)机制，实现多粒度场景建模。

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试上表现出色，优于最先进的竞争对手。

Conclusion: BIM模型成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，通过创新的扫描机制在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了充分的跨任务交互。

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的完整实验表明，该框架能够在文本方法失败的复杂场景中，通过融合音频信息来完成编辑任务。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频指导视觉编辑方案，有效解决了复杂多模态编辑挟房的挑战。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Motivation: 完全标注大规模多标签数据集成本高昂，单正多标签学习(SPML)中传统方法将缺失标签视为未知或负面会导致不准确和假阴性，而伪标签策略会引入额外噪声

Method: 提出广义伪标签鲁棒损失(GPR Loss)从多样化伪标签中有效学习并减轻噪声，配合动态增强多焦点伪标签(DAMP)技术，形成自适应高效视觉语言伪标签(AEVLP)框架

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了单正多标签学习中的噪声和准确性挑战

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种时间依赖的积分发火(tdIF)神经元架构，通过延迟刻刻技术解决异质刻刻模式导致的残余膜电位问题，在超低延迟(5个时间步内)下实现了视觉检测任务的独创性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍有所不足，需要解决异质刻刻模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 提出延迟刻刻方法来缓解残余膜电位问题，并设计了新的时间依赖积分发火(tdIF)神经元架构，使得IF神经元能够根据时间步的时序动态调整累积和发火行为。

Result: 在物体检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务中，方法超越了当前的ANN-SNN转换方法，在超低延迟(小于5个时间步)下达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: tdIF神经元架构能够以低于传统IF神经元的能耗，实现更精确的特征表示和更高的性能，为视觉检测任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升小结构和边缘区域的检测精度。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同融合，有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别在复杂场景下表现优异。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征的生成和处理能有效提升多视角行人检测的性能，特别是在处理尺度变化大的场景下表现优异

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过集成几何重密度化和跨尺度特征传播模块，该方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要大量角点案例进行训练验证，但真实世界收集成本高且危险。现有3D高斯溅射和图像生成方法存在视觉保真度有限和姿态控制不精确的问题

Method: 使用编辑对象的3D高斯表示作为密集先验注入去噪过程，采用场景级3D边界框布局重建非目标对象的遮挡区域，并引入层次化细粒度特征指导外观细节

Conclusion: G^2Editor提供了一个统一的框架，能够生成逼真且精确的驾驶场景编辑，为自动驾驶系统的训练和验证提供了有效的合成数据生成方案

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过疾病知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成病理数据，解决胎儿脑分割中CCD病例注释数据稀缺问题，显著提升了分割准确性和生物标记物提取效果。


<details>

Motivation: 胎儿脑部精确分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但胰体胶体发育不良(CCD)等缺陷病例稀缺，严重限制了深度学习模型的沿法性能。

Method: 提出疾病知识领域随机化策略，将CCD病变的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅使用健康数据即可模拟多样化的脑部变异。

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD病例和47例其他脑部病理的群体中验证，CCD案例分割性能显著提升，胰体胶体长度估计错误从10.9mm降至0.7mm，同时保持对其他病理的分割性能。

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提升对稀有但临床重要病变的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Motivation: 当前ASR系统对耳蜻人士不可访，而手语和唇读通常被单独研究，需要统一框架整合多模态

Method: 设计统一的模态无关架构，能处理异构输入，明确将唇部动作模式化为独立模态

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或超过专门模型的最高水平，唇部动作模态显著提升SLT性能

Conclusion: 统一框架有效整合多模态，唇部动作在手语理解中关键作用，为耳蜻人士提供更可访的通信解决方案

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架Video-MTR，通过多轮迭代逐步选择视频片段，基于门控双级奖励系统（轨迹级奖励和轮级奖励）优化视频片段选择和问题理解，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，推进了长视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮推理和门控奖励系统有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，无需外部视觉语言模型，实现了端到端训练和卓越性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力的正相关，但未能解决单目3D目标检测中固有的双重不确定性问题：语义不确定性（模糊类别预测）和几何不确定性（不稳定空间定位）

Method: 提出双重不确定性优化（DUO）框架：1）通过凸优化视角引入焦点损失的创新凸结构，推导出无监督版本实现标签不可知的uncertainty weighting；2）设计语义感知法向量场约束，在具有清晰语义线索的区域保持几何一致性；3）双分支机制形成互补循环

Result: 在多个数据集和域偏移类型上的广泛实验表明，DUO优于现有方法

Conclusion: DUO框架通过联合最小化语义和几何不确定性，显著提升了单目3D目标检测在真实世界域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效融合2D预训练专家和3D专家模型，解决了3D异常检测的瓶颈问题，具有工业部署的实用价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性，保持了训练良好的文本到图像模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与整体特征的一致性来多角度捕获数据特征，并设置自适应阈值计算样本置信度进行损失加权自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和置信度感知学习有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了错误累积问题，为持续测试时适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新颖视角合成至关重要，1像素的标定误差会显著影响重建质量。由于真实场景缺乏真实值，标定质量需要通过新颖视角合成质量来评估

Method: 提出使用3DGS模型，通过反向传播新颖视角颜色损失来微调相机参数，优化相机标定

Result: 新标定方法在3DGS参考数据集上平均带来0.4 dB PSNR的提升

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时，但对于参考场景（如Mip-NeRF 360）的标定，新颖视角质量是最重要的考量因素

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Conclusion: 该框架能够通过动态多模态样本选择有效降低标注成本，为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的主动学习方案。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过早期数据级融合和动态自我迭代策略，有效提升了无监督3D物体检测的性能，为解决高质量3D标签获取困难提供了有效途径

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

TL;DR: 本研究通过557个模拟实验，系统评估了7种主流域适应技术在自然图像和医学图像分类中的表现，发现DSAN算法在COVID-19等医学数据集上表现优异，准确率达91.2%，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%，且具有较好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 域适应技术能缓解训练集和测试集之间的分布差异，但现有研究主要基于自然图像而非医学数据，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。为了更好地理解域适应技术在自然和医学图像中的效益。

Method: 使用7种广泛使用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像数据集和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中比基线提升6.7%。DSAN在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出显著的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解域适应技术，并为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出色且具有实用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提高鲁棒性

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支来增强主干网络的特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失权重策略，训练初期强调辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最先进性能且无需额外后处理

Conclusion: CLAB方法通过简单的对比学习辅助分支和动态权重策略，有效提升了视频目标检测的鲁棒性和性能，同时保持了推理效率

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，并提出无需微调的选择性消融防御方法，显著提升抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类和恶意内容生成。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的脆弱性并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中负责提取和传输排版信息的专用注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需模型微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-100的排版变体上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的防御方法与现有基于微调的最先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费防御方法有效提升了CLIP模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性，发布的dyslexic CLIP模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Conclusion: 商图的区域级嵌入有助于提升预测性能，图神经网络为表情识别提供了结构化和可解释的学习框架

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Motivation: 当前虚拟试穿技术面临两大挑战：无法支持多参考服装组合（包括服装和配饰），以及在每个去噪步骤中重复计算参考特征导致的显著低效率。

Method: 提出基于可缓存扩散架构的FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制，用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损重用。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和DressCode-MR数据集上的实验表明，FastFit在关键保真度指标上超越最先进方法，同时实现平均3.5倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的缓存架构解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了高效解决方案和新的大规模数据集支持。

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，通过多模态融合提升了自动驾驶系统的语义理解安全性

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Conclusion: 提出的主动防御方法通过低频感知扰动有效破坏了深度伪造的生成过程，为对抗深度伪造技术提供了新的主动防御解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI方法能够有效生成合成MFI数据，为优化缺陷定位过程提供训练数据，解决MFI数据集稀缺的瓶颈问题

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的GAN-PFO框架有效解决了现有数据重构攻击在深层模型上的局限性，显著提升了攻击效果和通用性

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

TL;DR: MobileCLIP2是MobileCLIP的改进版本，通过更好的CLIP教师集成和改进的标题生成器，在保持低延迟的同时实现了最先进的零样本准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MobileCLIP的多模态强化训练方法，提升零样本准确率同时保持低延迟特性

Method: 1) 使用DFN数据集训练更好的CLIP教师集成 2) 在DFN数据集上训练改进的标题生成器教师，并在高质量图像-标题数据集上进行微调 3) 结合多个模型的合成标题

Result: MobileCLIP2在ImageNet-1k零样本准确率上取得显著提升，MobileCLIP2-B比MobileCLIP-B提升2.2%，MobileCLIP2-S4在2倍更小模型尺寸下达到SigLIP-SO400M/14的准确率

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2系列模型在低延迟下实现了最先进的零样本性能，证明了改进的多模态强化训练方法的有效性

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，专门解决现有方法因依赖正面图像而导致后脑部重建质量差的问题，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略来提升完整头像的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖正面视图图像，导致后脑部区域重建质量较差，出现几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）主体特定生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏正面输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习变换矩阵优化合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的几何对齐。

Result: 在NeRSemble和K-hairstyle数据集上的实验表明，AvatarBack在保持正面保真度的同时显著提升了后脑部重建质量，重建的头像在不同运动下保持一致的视觉真实感且完全可动画化。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后脑部区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中后视图质量差的问题，为构建完整一致的高质量头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自评估方法，通过生成去偏自判断分数来改善大型视觉语言模型的模态对齐，减少幻觉并提高安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂后处理，限制了可扩展性并增加成本，需要更自主的解决方案

Method: 生成去偏自判断分数作为自评估指标，无需外部资源，通过改进解码策略和偏好调优过程实现自主对齐改进

Result: 显著优于传统方法，有效减少幻觉、增强安全性并提升整体能力

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLM对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，实现了自主改进和更好的模态对齐效果

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在编码判别性、多视角一致特征方面存在不足，难以从稀疏输入视图中构建准确的几何结构，限制了渲染质量和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了C3-GS框架，集成了三个轻量级模块到统一的渲染流程中，包括上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束，改进了特征融合能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证，C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力，无需额外的监督即可实现照片级真实的合成效果。

Conclusion: C3-GS通过创新的特征学习约束机制，有效解决了稀疏视图下的几何构建问题，为通用高斯溅射提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，专注于在极端风格转换中保持面部身份识别性，通过风格优先、身份保持的方法实现高质量涂鸦生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涂鸦这种高对比度、抽象的媒介中，面部特征的细微扭曲会消除主体的可识别性，破坏个人和文化真实性，因此需要解决在极端风格转换中保持面部身份的问题。

Method: 采用LoRA微调的预训练扩散变换器进行涂鸦风格迁移，通过面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入，使用CLIP引导的提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制，遵循"风格优先、身份保持"范式。

Result: 定量结果显示具有竞争力的面部特征一致性和最先进的美学及人类偏好评分，定性分析和在Cruilla Festival的现场部署展示了系统的实际创作影响。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中融合风格自由和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法面临空间受限推理的挑战，主要依赖单视角定位，存在上下文遗漏和细节退化问题。需要消除场景特定训练需求，提高真实世界应用的泛化能力。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提议，并通过语义过滤进行精炼。采用提议引导的多视角投影策略将候选提议投影到真实场景图像序列上，保持空间关系和上下文细节。使用动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提高了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架通过多视角推理和空间信息利用，显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了3DVG向更大泛化能力和真实世界适用性的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在军事应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和噪声等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，需要评估其实战适用性

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比测试CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)进行评估，比较Transformer和CNN架构，分析线性探测和骨干网络微调的效果

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP consistently outperforms CNNs; 2) Fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions; 3) Linear-probed models' performance sharply drops at ~35% occlusion; 4) Backbone finetuning pushes performance drop threshold to >60% occlusion

Conclusion: 遮挡特定的数据增强在训练中至关重要，需要进一步探索补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在现实世界军事部署中的鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Result: 图像引导和多模态引导的训练数据在泛化到真实内容时表现更好，因为保留了视觉上下文信息，但整体分类性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断意图具有复杂性，需要专门的架构设计，当前方法在意图识别方面仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Method: 两阶段架构：因果链提取器(CCE)从视频-问题对生成因果链，因果链驱动回答器(CCDA)基于这些链生成答案；使用大语言模型从现有数据集生成高质量因果链

Result: 在三个大规模基准测试中超越最先进模型，在可解释性、用户信任和泛化能力方面获得显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了性能，还提供了可重用的因果推理引擎，为因果推理在视频问答中的应用提供了新的范式

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Conclusion: 利用多模态基础模型重新审视视频抽象概念理解时，应该借鉴数十年的社区经验，避免重复发明解决方案，从而更好地应对这一重要挑战。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经视频压缩中精确比特率控制的挑战，满足可变比特率场景的需求

Method: 动态路由自编码器（DRA）配合速率控制代理，采用联合路由优化策略进行协同训练

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅1.66%

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架有效解决了心脏运动估计问题，提供了更准确的运动场和可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标记，但在不同扫描仪、染色和采集条件下存在域偏移问题，导致识别一致性差

Method: 三阶段方法：(i)在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；(ii)使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失跨站点对齐注意力精炼特征；(iii)通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏以稳定预测

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

Motivation: 虽然皮肤病变分类模型准确度很高，但医疗实践中对AI模型的不信任仍是挑战，需要可信赖、可解释的诊断结果

Method: 提出Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation方法，概率化地分析所有类别的激活概率地图，并在像素级别进行统一可视化，结合SafeML检测误诊断

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers评估了方法，能够减少误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和病人安全

Conclusion: 该方法通过提供更可靠和可解释的诊断过程可视化，有助于建立医生和病亿对AI模型的信任，提高医疗安全性

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励黑客攻击，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益而破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO采用成对偏好奖励方法，在每组图像中使用偏好奖励模型进行成对比较，以胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励黑客问题。UniGenBench基准揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了T2I生成中的奖励不稳定问题，UniGenBench为全面评估T2I模型提供了更精细的标准

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在对象属性绑定和关系推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合语义方面存在困难，例如无法正确绑定对象属性和关系。

Method: 评估了三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下的表现，重点关注对象属性绑定和关系推理能力。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都面临显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表征过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在某些组合任务上表现优于CLIP，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都存在根本性挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表征学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 提出的面元基姿态学习回归方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向不确定性和噪声问题，在真实点云扫描数据上表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集有效模拟了真实世界挑战，Veritas检测器通过模式感知推理方法在复杂场景中展现出优异的泛化能力和解释性，推动了深度伪造检测向实际应用迈进。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合机制，有效解决了牙科龋齿检测的挑战，为临床牙科诊断提供了可靠的自动化工具。

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，但局部细微修改的伪造视频更具欺骗性且缺乏专门的检测方法和基准数据集。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造概念，创建了包含2.5万+视频的FakePartsBench数据集，提供像素级和帧级标注，并通过用户研究和SOTA检测模型进行验证。

Result: 实验显示FakeParts使人类检测准确率下降30%以上，现有最佳检测模型也出现类似性能下降，揭示了当前检测方法的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作发现了当前深度伪造检测的关键漏洞，提供了必要的资源来开发针对局部视频操作的更鲁棒检测方法。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中存在边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合，人群计数标注简单且适合密集场景。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，整合人群计数到VIF过程中；采用动态损失函数加权策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献；引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性和抗攻击能力。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 将人群计数整合到VIF框架中是有效的，多任务设计和动态加权策略能够实现两个任务的协同提升，对抗训练增强了模型稳定性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local

TL;DR: PathMR是一个细胞级多模态视觉推理框架，用于病理图像分析，能够生成专家级诊断解释并预测细胞分布模式，在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断中模型决策不透明、缺乏可追溯依据的问题，提供透明可解释的AI辅助病理诊断。

Method: 基于多模态视觉推理架构，给定病理图像和文本查询，同时生成分割掩码和语义对齐的文本解释，在细胞级别进行病理分析。

Result: 在PathGen数据集和新开发的GADVR数据集上，PathMR在文本生成质量、分割准确性和跨模态对齐方面均优于最先进的视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: PathMR展示了在AI驱动病理诊断中提高可解释性的潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于双模态成像（自发荧光和二次谐波生成）的深度学习框架，用于早期胰腺导管腺癌检测，在40个患者样本上实现了超过90%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是致死率最高的癌症之一，五年生存率低于10%，主要原因是晚期检测。需要开发早期检测方法来改善患者预后。

Method: 使用40个独特患者样本，评估了六种深度学习架构（包括传统CNN和现代ViT），最终采用改进的ResNet架构，包含冻结预训练层和类别加权训练来解决数据集小和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 优化后的框架在癌症检测方面实现了超过90%的准确率，显著优于当前的手动分析方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个强大的自动化PDAC检测流程，可以增强病理学家的能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型奠定了基础，同时为有限规模医学影像数据集上的深度学习应用提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于反事实推理的框架，用于解释、审计和缓解视觉分类器和生成模型中的偏见。通过系统性地改变语义属性，揭示了虚假相关性并构建了更鲁棒的系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，但需要开发系统化框架来量化和缓解模型偏见，特别是在视觉分类和生成模型中。

Method: 开发了多个方法：CAVLI结合归因和概念分析来量化决策依赖；ASAC使用对抗性反事实扰动保护属性；TIBET提供可扩展的偏见评估流程；BiasConnect构建因果图诊断交叉偏见；InterMit提供无需训练的偏见缓解算法。

Result: 这些方法能够揭示模型对无关线索的依赖，改善公平性和准确性，避免刻板印象，并提供可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解方案。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的方法来实现社会责任偏见管理。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优质密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割精度提供了高效且参数效率高的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: 深度集成模型在非典型有丝分裂象分类中表现良好，规则细化模块可提升特定指标但需要进一步研究

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized

innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network

training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including
texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging
multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs)

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: POSE是一个单步蒸馏框架，通过两阶段过程（稳定性预热和统一对抗平衡）来加速大规模视频扩散模型，将采样步骤从1000步减少到1步，同时保持视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频加速方法存在根本性限制：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗平衡机制在高斯噪声空间中实现稳定的单步对抗训练；3）条件对抗一致性方法提升条件视频生成的语义和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间连贯性和帧质量，将预训练模型的延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速）。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Motivation: 识别组织病理学图像中的非典型有丝分裂有助于医生准确评估肿瘤侵袭性，但机器学习模型在领域转移时会出现显著性能下降

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，利用与主要分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类对象而忽略图像中变化的背景域

Result: 在三个不同数据集（MIDOG 2025非典型训练集、Ami-Br数据集和MIDOG25挑战赛初步测试集）上的初步评估显示出有希望的性能

Conclusion: 多任务学习方法在解决组织病理学图像分析中的领域泛化问题方面具有潜力，能够提升模型在跨域场景下的识别性能

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频域感知的单样本手写体合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频域引导鉴别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，有效解决手写识别数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写体合成方法存在两个主要局限：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，且忽视了频域信息对捕捉细粒度风格细节的重要性。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频域引导鉴别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频域分布损失函数对齐合成与真实手写体的频域特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写体，有效增强低资源手写识别流程的数据。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频域感知方法显著提升了手写体合成的真实性和风格一致性，为低资源手写识别任务提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际收益的方法在保持99.5%性能的同时减少75%视觉token，加速推理3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1)基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2)使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化边际收益的方法有效解决了视频token冗余问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动路由和稀疏化技术，在提高效率的同时提升性能，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing将指令信息注入视觉编码器，选择性聚合压缩视觉token；2) LFP-Routing引入动作意图，修剪指令无关的视觉token实现token级稀疏；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，实现最先进性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐设计，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升效率，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供了可扩展的解决方案，已开源发布。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 首个数据驱动的多视角3D点跟踪器，使用4个摄像头即可进行精确的动态场景点位置跟踪，免去了单目跟踪的深度歧义和多摄像头方法的缓慢优化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目跟踪器遇到深度歧义和遮挡问题，而传统多摄像头方法需要20个以上摄像头和每序列优化，故需要一种更实用的多视角3D跟踪方法

Method: 使用已知摄像头姿态和深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器类更新机制来预测长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位轨迹误差，支持1-8个摄像头和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设定了新标准，提供了一种实用的工具，并将相关数据集和跟踪器开源发布

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，通过视觉语言模型作为生成奖励模型来区分不同任务的优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法通常依赖于任务特定的监督微调(SFT)，这限制了泛化能力和训练效率。多任务生成中不同任务的数据分布和评估标准差异很大，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，能够为不同任务和评估标准区分优劣。基于OneReward开发了Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基础模型上训练，无需任务特定的SFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上 consistently 优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]。

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，消除了对任务特定监督微调的依赖，提高了训练效率和模型泛化性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Abstract: We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high
quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a
user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference
video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops,
bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning
network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and
videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is
trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive
manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试现有水印技术的鲁棒性，应对不同对手知识水平的对抗攻击挑战

Method: 白盒跟踪使用自适应VAE规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB色彩空间对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过图像聚类分析，应用扩散模型和ChatGPT生成的语义先验进行噪声注入

Result: 实现了接近完美的水印移除效果（95.7%），同时对剩余图像质量影响极小

Conclusion: 该方法成功证明了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激发更鲁棒的水印方法开发

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Motivation: 尽管区块链技术有所进步，但L1区块链节点的运行成本仍然很高。最耗资源的组件是管理账户余额、随机数、代码和持久存储的区块链数据库(StateDB)。虽然行业已从分叉链转向无分叉链，但仍在使用不适合无分叉链的传统分叉数据库

Method: 提出了一种专门为无分叉区块链设计的数据库方案

Conclusion: 专门为无分叉区块链设计的数据库可以显著提升性能，解决当前区块链节点运行成本高的问题

Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in
blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node
is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances,
nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although
the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在数据库系统中的集成日益普遍，开源解决方案在功能性和性能方面仍有限。需要分析当前的技术限制并提出改进方案。

Method: 使用5个代表性查询对比分析了两个开源系统和一个企业平台，识别了主要问题并实施了初步解决方案。

Result: 发现了三个主要问题：结构化输出控制、资源利用优化和查询计划改进。初步解决方案在支持LLM SQL查询方面取得了改进效果。

Conclusion: 更紧密的LLM与数据库管理系统集成是实现可扩展和高效LLM查询处理的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Motivation: 数据已成为驱动各领域创新的基础资产，关系表上的预测建模日益重要。当前需要减少人工努力，通过AutoML技术自动化特征增强，识别和利用任务相关的关联信号。

Method: 1) 通过建模表内属性关系捕获语义依赖，将表划分为结构化语义段；2) 构建异质加权图表示跨所有段的行间关系；3) 使用消息传递图神经网络在图中传播信息，指导特征选择并增强原始数据集。

Result: 在10个真实和合成数据集上的广泛实验表明，ReCoGNN在分类和回归任务上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReCoGNN框架成功实现了自动化特征增强，能够有效利用多关系表中的语义信息来提升预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SpeedMalloc使用轻量级支持核心处理多线程应用的内存分配任务，通过将分配器元数据隔离在专用核心缓存中，减少缓存冲突和跨核同步开销，相比现有软件和硬件分配器实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内存分配虽然只占代码的很小部分，但在现代多线程多核系统中会对整体性能产生蝴蝶效应，导致高达2.7倍的性能差异。现有加速器方案对多线程支持有限，核心与加速器间同步仍是挑战。

Method: 采用轻量级可编程支持核心处理内存分配任务，该核心具有高效的跨核数据同步能力，将所有分配器元数据存放在自身缓存中，避免与用户数据产生缓存冲突，无需跨核元数据同步。

Result: 与Jemalloc、TCMalloc、Mimalloc、Mallacc和Memento等先进分配器相比，SpeedMalloc在多线程工作负载上分别实现了1.75倍、1.18倍、1.15倍、1.23倍和1.18倍的加速。

Conclusion: SpeedMalloc通过专用支持核心的设计有效解决了多线程内存分配的缓存污染和同步开销问题，相比专用加速器方案更具通用性和可扩展性，能够适应新的分配器设计。

Abstract: Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed
code, can have a "butterfly effect" on overall program performance, leading to
significant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately
5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x
performance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from
the complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core
systems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading
to cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.
Offloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a
potential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache
pollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for
multi-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators
remains a significant challenge.
  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory
allocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a
lightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data
synchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This
design minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for
cross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core
instead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting
new allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software
and hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and
Memento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on
multithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的LLM性能优化方法缺乏硬件感知能力，而人类性能工程师依赖硬件特性来实现接近最优的利用率。需要让LLM具备硬件意识来进行软件级优化。

Method: SwizzlePerf通过向LLM提供工作负载的内存访问模式、架构规格、过滤的性能日志和历史性能反思，自动为分离架构的GPU内核生成空间优化。

Result: 在GEMM内核上，SwizzlePerf在5分钟内生成专家需要2周才能找到的最优swizzling模式。在10个多样化ML和科学内核中，9个内核实现了最高2.06倍加速和70%的L2命中率提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统性地创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的工作，为未来开发更智能的性能优化工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

TL;DR: 通过动态MIG重配、PCIe感知位置和轻量拦抱器的主机级控制器，减少共享A100集群中的PCIe线缆干扰，改善尾部延迟和SLO违约率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享A100集群中的延迟敏感性推理受到PCIe线缆上的噪声邻居干扰，导致尾部延迟增加和SLO违约问题。

Method: 设计了一个线缆无关的、支持VM部署的主机级控制器，结合动态MIG重新配置、PCIe感知位置和轻量拦抱器，通过采样每个租户的尾部性能和系统信号来避免PCIe热点。

Result: 在单主机和2节点（16-GPU）集群上，SLO失败率减少32%，尾部p99延迟改善15%，通过成本仅为吞吐量的5%。LLM服务中TTFT p99延迟改善10-15%。

Conclusion: 该控制器能够有效减少PCIe线缆干扰，显著改善尾部延迟和SLO遵循率，且在LLM服务中同样有效。

Abstract: Latency-sensitive inference on shared A100 clusters often suffers
noisy-neighbor interference on the PCIe fabric, inflating tail latency and SLO
violations. We present a fabric-agnostic, VM-deployable host-level controller
that combines dynamic Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) reconfiguration, PCIe-aware
placement, and lightweight guardrails (MPS quotas, cgroup I/O). It samples
per-tenant tails and system signals, uses topology hints to avoid PCIe hot
spots, and gates actions with dwell/cool-down to avoid thrash. On a single host
and a 2-node (16-GPU) cluster, SLO miss-rate is reduced by \(\approx\)32\%
(\(\approx\)1.5) and p99 latency improves \(\approx\)15\% with \(\leq\)5\%
throughput cost versus static MIG and naive placement; ablations show MIG and
placement contribute comparably. We also evaluate LLM serving with vLLM on OLMo
2 7B Instruct: TTFT p99 improves \(\approx\)10--15\% at \(\leq\)5\% cost
without changing the controller.

TL;DR: CoFormer是一个协作推理系统，通过将大型transformer模型分解为多个小模型在边缘设备上分布式推理，解决了计算资源受限的问题，实现了3.1倍加速和76.3%内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决transformer模型在资源受限的边缘设备上部署时面临的高计算需求和资源要求问题，现有方法要么通信开销大，要么在准确性和效率之间权衡不佳。

Method: 利用transformer的可分割性和可集成性，将大型transformer分解为多个小模型进行分布式推理，中间结果聚合生成最终输出。使用DeBo算法求解优化问题确定分解策略，并通过渐进校准恢复性能。

Result: 支持多种transformer模型在异构边缘设备上运行，实现3.1倍推理加速，GPT2-XL模型内存需求减少76.3%，能耗降低约40%，同时保持满意的推理性能。

Conclusion: CoFormer通过协作推理方法有效解决了边缘设备上大型transformer模型部署的挑战，在性能、效率和资源消耗方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了pdGRASS并行算法，解决了现有feGRASS方法在并行化和偏斜输入性能上的问题，实现了3.9-8.8倍加速和更好的稀疏化质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有feGRASS方法存在两个主要问题：1）恢复步骤因严格数据依赖难以并行化；2）在偏斜输入上性能下降，需要多次遍历才能恢复足够边

Method: pdGRASS并行算法，将边组织成无数据依赖的独立子任务，实现高效并行化和单次遍历中的充分边恢复

Result: pdGRASS平均加速3.9-8.8倍，稀疏化器质量提升（PCG迭代次数1.2倍高至1.8倍低），最坏情况下实现1000倍以上加速

Conclusion: pdGRASS在图谱稀疏化问题上显著提升了可扩展性和性能表现

Abstract: Graph Spectral Sparsification (GSS) identifies an ultra-sparse subgraph, or
sparsifier, whose Laplacian matrix closely approximates the spectral properties
of the original graph, enabling substantial reductions in computational
complexity for computationally intensive problems in scientific computing. The
state-of-the-art method for efficient GSS is feGRASS, consisting of two steps:
1) spanning tree generation and 2) off-tree edge recovery. However, feGRASS
suffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery
step for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed
inputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address
these challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral
Sparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into
disjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient
parallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically
evaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)
sparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in
a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation
demonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves
average speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x. The resulting sparsifiers also show
between 1.2x higher and 1.8x lower PCG iteration counts, with further
improvements as more edges are recovered. Additionally, pdGRASS mitigates the
worst-case runtimes of feGRASS with over 1000x speedup. These results highlight
pdGRASS's significant improvements in scalability and performance for the graph
spectral sparsification problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模微服务架构中复杂的服务依赖关系、动态拓扑结构和波动工作负载等治理挑战，提升系统治理效率和运行稳定性。

Method: 将每个服务建模为智能体，使用图表示学习构建服务依赖图，采用集中训练分散执行框架，设计博弈驱动的策略优化机制，通过选择-变异过程动态调整智能体策略分布。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多项关键指标上优于其他先进方法，显著提高了大规模微服务系统的治理效率和运行稳定性，展现出强大的实用价值和工程可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够快速响应突发工作负载峰值、拓扑重构或资源冲突等场景，实现稳定的策略收敛，为大规模微服务系统治理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a
multi-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges
in large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex
service dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.
The method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation
learning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to
perceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its
policy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and
decentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with
global coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a
game-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a
selection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically
adjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among
services. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve
stable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,
topology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative
microservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against
several advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,
and policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves
governance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice
systems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering
feasibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线通信从人类中心服务转向机器中心服务，对速率、延迟和可靠性的要求发生了巨大变化，URLLC成为5G/6G的核心需求之一。

Method: 采用分层方法，详细讨论了物理层、MAC层以及跨层技术，并涵盖各种5G及更高级垂直应用的设计考虑。

Result: 综述了为实现99.999%高可靠性和1ms以内延迟的相关技术方案，识别了这两个目标之间的本质矛盾。

Conclusion: 文章总结了URLLC领域的挑战和未来展望，尤其重点关注新兴的6G范式。

Abstract: As the wireless communication paradigm is being transformed from human
centered communication services towards machine centered communication
services, the requirements of rate, latency and reliability for these services
have also been transformed drastically. Thus the concept of Ultra Reliable and
Low Latency Communication (URLLC) has emerged as a dominant theme for 5G and 6G
systems. Though the latency and reliability requirement varies from one use
case to another, URLLC services generally aim to achieve very high reliability
in the range of 99.999\% while ensuring the latency of up to 1 ms. These two
targets are however inherently opposed to one another. Significant amounts of
work have been carried out to meet these ambitious but conflicting targets. In
this article a comprehensive survey of the URLLC approaches in 5G systems are
analysed in detail. Effort has been made to trace the history and evolution of
latency and reliability issues in wireless communication. A layered approach is
taken where physical layer, Medium Access Control (MAC) layer as well as cross
layer techniques are discussed in detail. It also covers the design
consideration for various 5G and beyond verticals. Finally the article
concludes by providing a detailed discussion on challenges and future outlook
with particular focus on the emerging 6G paradigm.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: DRR-MDPF是一种结合马尔可夫决策过程转发(MDPF)和赤字轮询(DRR)算法的混合策略，用于命名数据网络(NDN)的队列和资源管理，显著提升了网络性能。


<details>

Motivation: 命名数据网络(NDN)需要高效的队列和资源管理来应对动态高流量环境，传统方法在性能优化方面存在不足。

Method: 将MDPF模型与DRR算法结合，使路由器能够基于带宽、延迟和未满足兴趣数等指标智能预测最优转发决策，同时确保数据流间的公平带宽分配。

Result: 在ndnSIM仿真中，DRR-MDPF在吞吐量、兴趣满足率、丢包率、内容检索时间和负载均衡等多个指标上显著优于SAF、RFA、SMDPF和LA-MDPF等先进策略。

Conclusion: DRR-MDPF为NDN提供了智能、自适应且可扩展的队列管理解决方案，有效解决了动态网络环境中的资源分配、拥塞控制和路由优化等核心挑战。

Abstract: Named Data Networking (NDN) represents a transformative shift in network
architecture, prioritizing content names over host addresses to enhance data
dissemination. Efficient queue and resource management are critical to NDN
performance, especially under dynamic and high-traffic conditions. This paper
introduces DRR-MDPF, a novel hybrid strategy that integrates the Markov
Decision Process Forwarding (MDPF) model with the Deficit Round Robin (DRR)
algorithm. MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding
decisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of
unsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation
among competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a
learning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback
and probabilistic updates. Simulation results using ndnSIM demonstrate that
DRR-MDPF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art strategies including SAF,
RFA, SMDPF, and LA-MDPF across various metrics such as throughput, Interest
Satisfaction Rate (ISR), packet drop rate, content retrieval time, and load
balancing. Notably, DRR-MDPF maintains robustness under limited cache sizes and
heavy traffic, offering enhanced adaptability and lower computational
complexity due to its single-path routing design. Furthermore, its multi-metric
decision-making capability enables more accurate interface selection, leading
to optimized network performance. Overall, DRR-MDPF serves as an intelligent,
adaptive, and scalable queue management solution for NDN, effectively
addressing core challenges such as resource allocation, congestion control, and
route optimization in dynamic networking environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Whittle指数的中继选择策略，用于解决无线网络中源节点通过多个中继向目的地传输数据时的最小化包持有成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中，当源节点和目的节点之间的直接链路被阻塞时，需要利用多个候选中继转发数据包。每个中继存储数据包都会产生持有成本，目标是设计一个中继选择策略来最小化长期平均总包持有成本。

Conclusion: 该论文成功地将RMAB理论应用于无线中继选择问题，提出的Whittle指数策略能够有效优化网络性能，为类似的多臂赌博机问题提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which a source node needs to transmit a
large file to a destination node. The direct wireless link between the source
and the destination is assumed to be blocked. Multiple candidate relays are
available to forward packets from the source to the destination. A holding cost
is incurred for each packet stored at every relay in each time slot. The
objective is to design a policy for selecting a relay in each time slot to
which the source attempts to send a packet, so as to minimize the expected
long-run time-averaged total packet holding cost at the relays. This problem is
an instance of the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, which is
provably hard to solve. We prove that this relay selection problem is
Whittle-indexable, and propose a method to compute the Whittle index of each
relay in every time slot. In each time slot, our relay selection policy
transmits a packet to the relay with the smallest Whittle index. Using
simulations, we show that the proposed policy outperforms the relay selection
policies proposed in prior work in terms of average cost, delay, as well as
throughput.

Result: 显著降低平均端到端延迟和能耗，提升训练效率并加速策略收敛

Conclusion: 为边缘核心网络中智能VNF迁移建立了新的性能基准

Abstract: The growing demand for services and the rapid deployment of virtualized
network functions (VNFs) pose significant challenges for achieving low-latency
and energy-efficient orchestration in modern edge-core network infrastructures.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a Digital Twin (DT)-empowered
Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for intelligent VNF migration that
jointly minimizes average end-to-end (E2E) delay and energy consumption. By
formulating the VNF migration problem as a Markov Decision Process and
utilizing the Advantage Actor-Critic model, the proposed framework enables
adaptive and real-time migration decisions. A key innovation of the proposed
framework is the integration of a DT module composed of a multi-task
Variational Autoencoder and a multi-task Long Short-Term Memory network. This
combination collectively simulates environment dynamics and generates
high-quality synthetic experiences, significantly enhancing training efficiency
and accelerating policy convergence. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
performance gains, such as significant reductions in both average E2E delay and
energy consumption, thereby establishing new benchmarks for intelligent VNF
migration in edge-core networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAN系统复杂且产生海量KPI数据，传统方法难以有效处理动态性能变化和时间依赖性，需要自适应方法来可靠检测性能异常。

Method: 集成生成对抗网络(GAN)和Transformer架构，采用滑动窗口方法进行数据预处理以增强时间依赖关系捕获能力。

Result: 在公开的RAN性能数据集上验证，RANGAN实现了良好的检测准确率，特别是在识别网络竞争问题时达到了83%的F1分数。

Conclusion: RANGAN框架有效解决了RAN系统异常检测的挑战，证明了GAN与Transformer结合在捕获时间依赖性和检测性能异常方面的有效性。

Abstract: Radio Access Network (RAN) systems are inherently complex, requiring
continuous monitoring to prevent performance degradation and ensure optimal
user experience. The RAN leverages numerous key performance indicators (KPIs)
to evaluate system performance, generating vast amounts of data each second.
This immense data volume can make troubleshooting and accurate diagnosis of
performance anomalies more difficult. Furthermore, the highly dynamic nature of
RAN performance demands adaptive methodologies capable of capturing temporal
dependencies to detect anomalies reliably. In response to these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{RANGAN}, an anomaly detection framework that integrates a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a transformer architecture. To
enhance the capability of capturing temporal dependencies within the data,
RANGAN employs a sliding window approach during data preprocessing. We
rigorously evaluated RANGAN using the publicly available RAN performance
dataset from the Spotlight project \cite{sun-2024}. Experimental results
demonstrate that RANGAN achieves promising detection accuracy, notably
attaining an F1-score of up to $83\%$ in identifying network contention issues.

TL;DR: 本文提出DSROQ算法，结合MCTS启发式方法和Lyapunov优化调度，在LEO卫星网络中联合优化路由和带宽分配，提升用户体验和公平性。


<details>

Motivation: 现代互联网应用具有异构QoS需求，LEO卫星星座需要联合优化路由、带宽分配和动态队列调度来保证服务质量，特别是在农村覆盖和城市补充网络场景中。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)启发方法解决NP-hard路由带宽分配问题，结合Lyapunov优化进行调度奖励评估，将QoS要求作为软约束处理。

Result: 在Starlink星座测试中，DSROQ算法相比基准方案显著提升了终端用户体验和公平性，并证明了联合路由带宽决策的优势。性能主导因素随流量敏感性从延迟驱动转向带宽驱动而变化。

Conclusion: 联合路由和带宽分配对LEO卫星网络QoS保障至关重要，DSROQ算法有效解决了这一复杂优化问题，为异构QoS需求的卫星网络提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The modern Internet supports diverse applications with heterogeneous quality
of service (QoS) requirements. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations
offer a promising solution to meet these needs, enhancing coverage in rural
areas and complementing terrestrial networks in urban regions. Ensuring QoS in
such networks requires joint optimization of routing, bandwidth allocation, and
dynamic queue scheduling, as traffic handling is critical for maintaining
service performance. This paper formulates a joint routing and bandwidth
allocation problem where QoS requirements are treated as soft constraints,
aiming to maximize user experience. An adaptive scheduling approach is
introduced to prioritize flow-specific QoS needs. We propose a Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS)-inspired method to solve the NP-hard route and bandwidth
allocation problem, with Lyapunov optimization-based scheduling applied during
reward evaluation. Using the Starlink Phase 1 Version 2 constellation, we
compare end-user experience and fairness between our proposed DSROQ algorithm
and a benchmark scheme. Results show that DSROQ improves both performance
metrics and demonstrates the advantage of joint routing and bandwidth
decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the dominant performance factor shifts
from scheduling to routing and bandwidth allocation as traffic sensitivity
changes from latency-driven to bandwidth-driven.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管程序验证技术有所进展，但递归数据结构的全自动验证仍是挑战。需要一种能够高效推断数据结构不变量的方法，以提升自动化验证能力。

Method: 引入可解元组模式(STP)概念，开发STP推断算法，并将其集成到支持列表式数据结构的CHC求解器中，作为程序验证工具的统一后端。

Result: 集成STP推断的CHC求解器在CHC-COMP 2025的ADT-LIN类别中以显著优势获胜，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: STP提供了一种高效推断递归数据结构不变量的新方法，仅需正样本且可自动验证，显著提升了程序自动化验证的能力。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques,
fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures
remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs)
to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A
distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from
only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An
SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an
inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic
properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate
the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting
list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated
program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has
won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然任何贝叶斯网络都可以实现为概率程序，但反向表示（特别是包含用户标记的sample语句和while循环的概率程序）仍是一个开放性问题。这类程序在Gen、Turing、Pyro等语言中很常见。

Method: 通过扩展现有操作语义支持语言特性，将程序转换为控制流图，定义静态分析来近似程序中随机变量的依赖结构，获得静态因子分解表示，并开发了基于程序切片的优化技术。

Result: 获得了无循环和常量标签程序的贝叶斯网络因子分解等价表示，以及定义无限随机变量程序的新图形表示。三项优化技术（变分推断梯度估计方差降低、单点Metropolis Hastings和顺序蒙特卡洛加速）被证明正确且在实证中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该工作为包含循环和动态标签的概率程序提供了有效的图形化表示方法，并开发了基于程序切片结构的优化技术，显著提升了概率编程语言的性能。

Abstract: It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a
probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work,
we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with
user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages
like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we
extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By
translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static
analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in
the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly
defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network
factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a
novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of
random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound
program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three
well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the
variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both
single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations
are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing
techniques.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了LLM在生成实际微服务应用代码方面的能力，发现强大LLM在中等难度规范上表现不错，但在高难度规范上表现很差，主要因难点包括复杂的业务逻辑、外部服务集成和非功能性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在生成实际微服务应用代码方面的进展，微服务架构是一种广泛使用的架构模式。

Method: 定义了微服务应用的标准规范模板，提出了规范难度评估指标，并开发了自动化测试LLM生成代码的框架。

Result: 强大LLM（如GPT-3o-mini）在中等难度规范上表现不错，但在高难度规范上表现很差，主要因难点是复杂的业务逻辑、外部服务集成、数据库集成和非功能性能力如认证等。

Conclusion: LLM在生成实际微服务代码时面临重大挑战，需要进一步研究来改善代码合成能力，特别是在复杂业务逻辑和系统集成方面。

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in
code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Chimera是一个基于LLM的SMT求解器模糊测试框架，通过生成可重用的项生成器而非直接生成公式，解决了现有方法中语法无效和计算开销大的问题，在Z3和cvc5中发现了43个已确认的bug。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMT求解器在现代系统和编程语言研究中至关重要，但现有测试技术难以跟上快速发展的求解器特性。基于LLM的方法虽然显示出潜力，但存在生成的公式近一半语法无效以及迭代交互带来巨大计算开销的问题。

Method: Chimera使用LLM从文档中自动提取SMT理论的上下文无关文法（包括求解器特定扩展），并合成可组合的布尔项生成器。在模糊测试时，用LLM合成的生成器产生的项填充现有公式的结构骨架，确保语法有效性同时促进语义多样性。

Result: 在Z3和cvc5两个主流SMT求解器上的实验表明，Chimera发现了43个已确认的bug，其中40个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: Chimera通过从直接公式生成转向可重用项生成器合成，有效解决了LLM辅助测试中的语法无效和计算开销问题，显著提升了SMT求解器测试的效率和效果。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

TL;DR: RCLAgent是一个基于多智能体递归思维框架的自适应根因定位方法，通过模拟人类SRE的递归性、多维度扩展和跨模态推理特征，在单次请求中就能准确定位微服务系统故障根因，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代微服务系统日益复杂，故障频发，现有根因定位方法要么依赖预定义模式难以适应变化，要么缺乏可解释性让SRE困惑。通过研究SRE的人工根因分析过程，发现其具有递归性、多维度扩展和跨模态推理三大特征。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验评估表明，RCLAgent仅需单次请求就能定位根因，性能优于依赖聚合多个请求的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RCLAgent能有效提升复杂微服务环境中根因定位的效率和精确度，证明了该方法在增强系统可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律文本采用技术中性语言编写，工程师手动创建合规需求文档劳动密集且易出错，需要利用GenAI自动化这一过程

Method: 采用准实验设计，10名参与者评估Claude和Llama从食品安全法规生成的60个Gherkin规范，每个规范由2人评估5个标准

Result: 相关性75%最高评分，清晰度90%最高，完整性75%最高，单一性82%最高，时间节省68%最高。模型间无显著差异，Llama在清晰度、完整性和时间节省上略优

Conclusion: LLM能够从法律文本生成高质量的Gherkin规范，减少人工工作量，为实施、保证和测试生成提供有用结构化成果

Abstract: Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality
assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This
creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as
requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),
especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such
artifacts.
  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'
ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a
quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements
into a developer-friendly form.
  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety
regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60
specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five
criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each
specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.
  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.
Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.
Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No
lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences
across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,
Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.
Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the
specifications.
  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal
texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for
implementation, assurance, and test generation.

Abstract: Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in
software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address
it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural
perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns,
activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to
tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also
independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we
present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of
architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target
sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision
through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from
conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the
relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight
implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial
needs.

Conclusion: 基于遗传编程与Ochiai公式的断言测试预言方法能够有效解决CPS测试中的高成本和不可靠性问题，提供高准确性且对系统不稳定性具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the
time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be
flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test
re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not
require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.
Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human
understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential
flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test
oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the
inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test
oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,
fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe
two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic
programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization
(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness
functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We
evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains
of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles
generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those
obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this
accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system
under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by
GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in
their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving
systems with flaky behaviours.

Conclusion: 该方法通过专用数据集、并发语义表征和精确定位能力，有效解决了并发bug检测和定位的挑战

Abstract: Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in
multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus
compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning
methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and
dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack
sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary
classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as
precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for
effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a
dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.
We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network
(GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that
concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further
facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method,
which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them
to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an
improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to
state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.

Conclusion: ConfLogger有效增强了软件配置可诊断性，为配置相关问题的诊断提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration
spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues
such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability
supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify
configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the
software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the
blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging
practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that
unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation
to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1)
identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing
configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates
diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation
results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of
ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,
ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration
diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent
misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit
configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%
coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers
by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall,
and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of
variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user
study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by
1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.

Motivation: 当面板AR(1)模型的自回归参数rho=1时，修正轮廓对数似然函数存在平稳拐点，rho是一阶未识别但二阶识别的，需要发展相应的估计和推断理论。

Result: 广义MMLE估计器以概率1存在且唯一定义，对任意|rho|≤1一致，当rho=1时收敛速度为N^{1/4}，QLM检验和基于其反转的置信区域在|rho|≤1时具有正确的渐近尺寸。

Conclusion: 本文为面板AR(1)模型在单位根情况下的估计和推断提供了完整的理论框架，解决了rho=1时的识别和渐近分布问题，QLM检验具有良好的有限样本性质。

Abstract: In this paper we consider two kinds of generalizations of Lancaster's (Review
of Economic Studies, 2002) Modified ML estimator (MMLE) for the panel AR(1)
model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions and possibly
covariates when the time dimension, T, is fixed. When the autoregressive
parameter rho=1, the limiting modified profile log-likelihood function for this
model has a stationary point of inflection, and rho is first-order
underidentified but second-order identified. We show that the generalized MMLEs
exist w.p.a.1. and are uniquely defined w.p.1. and consistent for any value of
|rho| =< 1. When rho=1, the rate of convergence of the MMLEs is N^{1/4}, where
N is the cross-sectional dimension of the panel. We then develop an asymptotic
theory for GMM estimators when one of the parameters is only second-order
identified and use this to derive the limiting distributions of the MMLEs. They
are generally asymmetric when rho=1. We also show that Quasi LM tests that are
based on the modified profile log-likelihood and use its expected rather than
observed Hessian, with an additional modification for rho=1, and confidence
regions based on inverting these tests have correct asymptotic size in a
uniform sense when |rho| =< 1. Finally, we investigate the finite sample
properties of the MMLEs and the QLM test in a Monte Carlo study.

Result: 证明使用期望Hessian的(Q)LM检验和置信集具有正确的渐近尺寸（在一致意义上），当模型仅二阶识别时，固定效应LM检验达到最坏情况下的最大可获得功率曲线。

Conclusion: 提出的(Q)LM检验方法在面板AR模型推断中具有理论上的最优性和实际应用的稳健性，特别是在处理弱识别和异方差性问题时表现优异。

Abstract: This paper proposes new inference methods for panel AR models with arbitrary
initial conditions and heteroskedasticity and possibly additional regressors
that are robust to the strength of identification. Specifically, we consider
several Maximum Likelihood based methods of constructing tests and confidence
sets (CSs) and show that (Quasi) LM tests and CSs that use the expected Hessian
rather than the observed Hessian of the log-likelihood have correct asymptotic
size (in a uniform sense). We derive the power envelope of a Fixed Effects
version of such a LM test for hypotheses involving the autoregressive parameter
when the average information matrix is estimated by a centered OPG estimator
and the model is only second-order identified, and show that it coincides with
the maximal attainable power curve in the worst case setting. We also study the
empirical size and power properties of these (Quasi) LM tests and CSs.

Motivation: 印尼东部地区公务员需要展现创新工作行为，但变革型领导、工作投入与组织公正对这些行为的影响机制尚不明确，需要实证研究来填补这一空白。

Method: 在印尼北马鲁古省各区域机构组织中随机抽取500名公务员作为样本，采用结构方程模型-偏最小二乘法（SEM-PLS）回归分析来检验因果关系和调节效应。

Result: 研究发现变革型领导和工作投入对创新工作行为有直接影响，但组织公正既无直接影响，也不具备调节作用。

Conclusion: 研究强调了领导力和工作投入在提升公务员创新行为中的重要性，拓展了社会交换理论在公务员创新工作行为中的应用，并为印尼地方政府组织提供了理论和实践贡献。

Abstract: Regional civil servants in Indonesia, especially in the eastern regions, are
now required to exhibit innovative work behavior (IWB) as mandated by national
regulations. While transformational leadership (TFL) and work engagement (WE)
are believed to foster such behavior, the impact and the moderating role of
organizational justice (OJ) remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap
by examining how TFL and WE contribute to IWB development within the context of
public sector work, with OJ potentially moderating these relationships. This
study aimed to determine the direct influence of TFL, WE, and OJ on IWB and to
analyze the role of OJ as a moderating variable. This research was conducted in
the eastern region of Indonesia, especially North Maluku Province, in various
regional apparatus organizations. and a random sample of 500 people was taken.
This study used Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS)
regression analysis as a data analysis method to test the causal relationship
and moderation effects of each hypothesis. The study findings reveal that while
TFL and WE directly influence IWB, OJ neither has a direct effect nor serves as
a moderating variable. These findings offer theoretical and practical
contributions to local government organizations in Indonesia, emphasizing the
importance of leadership and engagement in enhancing innovative behavior at
work. This study extends and enhances the development of social exchange theory
based on civil servants' IWB. Furthermore, this study expands the theoretical
perspective by examining how TFL, WE, and OJ influence innovative work behavior
practices to improve employee innovative behaviour. Finally, this study
empirically examines the moderating impact of organizational justice on the
relationship between TFL and WE on IWB.

*Yongheng Hu*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 大数据环境下消费效用函数存在缺陷，提出认知资源稀释理论，构建消费调整权重函数，发现金融摩擦降低会增加企业平均财富但加剧不平等，有效消费权重在0.5时财富不平等最低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大数据环境下传统消费效用函数的局限性，特别是非理性消费无法转化为效用的问题，需要新的理论框架来解释大数据对消费者认知和决策的影响

Method: 提出认知资源稀释理论，构建消费调整权重函数(CAWF)，应用平均场博弈(MFG)方法建立企业财富分布模型并进行理论实证分析

Result: 金融摩擦降低会增加企业平均财富但加剧财富不平等；有效消费权重增加会提升平均财富，财富不平等呈U型变化，权重接近0.5时不平等最低

Conclusion: 为完善'卢卡斯批判'提供了新的补充假说，强调认知资源作为禀赋在决策中的重要性，为大数据环境下的经济决策理论提供新视角

Abstract: Big data has exponentially dilated consumption demand and speed, but can they
all convert to utility? We argue about the measures of consumption and utility
acquisition in CARR utility function under the condition of big data
interaction, we indicate its weakness, i.e., irrational consumption does not
lead to the acquisition of utility. We consider that big data, which is
different from macro and micro economic signals, formed by general information
entropy, affects agents' rational cognition, which makes a part of their
consumption ineffective. We preliminarily propose the theory that how dilution
mechanism driven by big data will affect agents' cognitive resources. Based on
theoretical and empirical analysis, we construct the Consumption Adjustment
Weight Function (CAWF) of agents interacting with big data and further apply it
to a model of firm wealth distribution with financial frictions, we get
analytical solutions according to the Mean Field Game (MFG) and find: Lower
financial friction increases the average wealth of firms but also leads to
greater wealth inequality. When agents convert effective consumption into
utility, which is a weight of total consumption, the average wealth of firms
increases with the weight increasing. Meanwhile, wealth inequality follows a
U-shaped trend, and it will be the lowest level when the weight approaches to
0.5. In conclusion, we try to provide a new complementary hypothesis to refine
the 'Lucas Critique' according to the cognitive resources as endowments
involved in the decision-making of agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专利引用能否作为衡量发明技术价值、私人经济价值和社会价值的有效代理指标

Method: 系统回顾使用专家评分、市场数据、续展记录和补偿报告等验证研究的实证证据

Result: 引用数量与各种价值维度呈正相关，但相关性较弱，是一个噪声较大而非确定性的指标

Conclusion: 专利引用可作为发明重要性的粗略代理指标，但需要谨慎使用并配合其他验证方法

Abstract: This article reviews the empirical evidence on the use of patent citations as
a proxy for invention importance. It distinguishes between technical merit,
private economic value, and social value, and surveys validation studies using
expert ratings, market data, renewal records, and compensation reports. The
findings confirm that while the count of citations is positively associated
with various dimensions of value, it remains a noisy indicator -- correlated
but far from definitive.

TL;DR: 论文认为异质主体宏观经济学中的理性预期假设不现实，应被替代，因为其导致维度诅咒和计算困难，限制了方法在金融危机等核心问题中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理性预期假设要求决策者通过预测横截面分布来预测均衡价格，这导致了极端的维度诅咒问题，使得动态规划问题变得无限维且计算困难，限制了异质主体方法在宏观经济学核心问题中的应用。

Method: 论文提出了三个替代标准：计算可行性、与经验证据的一致性、对卢卡斯批判的（部分）免疫力，并讨论了临时均衡方法、调查预期、最小二乘学习和强化学习等有前景的方向。

Result: 分析表明理性预期假设在异质主体环境中存在根本性问题，需要寻找更现实的替代方案来推动宏观经济学发展。

Conclusion: 理性预期假设在异质主体宏观经济学中不切实际，应该被基于计算可行性、经验一致性和卢卡斯批判免疫性的替代方法所取代，这将有助于解决宏观经济学的核心问题。

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that, in heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, the
assumption of rational expectations about equilibrium prices is unrealistic and
should be replaced. Rational expectations imply that decision makers forecast
equilibrium prices like interest rates by forecasting cross-sectional
distributions. This leads to an extreme version of the curse of dimensionality:
dynamic programming problems in which the entire distribution is a state
variable ("Master equation" a.k.a. "Monster equation"). Frontier computational
methods struggle with these infinite-dimensional Bellman equations, making it
implausible that real-world agents solve the associated decision problems.
These difficulties also limit the applicability of the heterogeneous-agent
approach to central questions in macroeconomics -- those involving aggregate
risk and non-linearities such as financial crises. This troublesome feature of
the rational expectations assumption poses a challenge: what should replace it?
I outline three criteria for alternative approaches: (1) computational
tractability, (2) consistency with empirical evidence, and (3) (some) immunity
to the Lucas critique. I then discuss several promising directions, including
temporary equilibrium approaches, incorporating survey expectations,
least-squares learning, and reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FARC 2014年单方面永久停火对哥伦比亚国内强制流离失所（FID）的影响，该国因长期冲突成为全球FID最严重的国家之一

Method: 采用双重差分法（difference-in-differences），利用停火时机和冲突前FARC在各城市分布情况进行分析

Result: 受影响地区严重流离失所事件大幅减少，效果逐渐显现并持续存在

Conclusion: 稳定性和和平协议的有效实施对于减轻FID及其深远后果至关重要

Abstract: Colombia's prolonged conflict has made the country one of the most affected
by forced internal displacement (FID) in the world. This study examines the
impact of the FARC's 2014 unilateral and permanent ceasefire on FID. We use a
difference-in-differences strategy that exploits the timing of the ceasefire
and the pre-conflict distribution of FARC presence across municipalities.
Results show a substantial reduction in severe displacement episodes in
affected areas, with effects that emerged gradually and persisted over time.
These findings highlight the importance of stability and the effective
implementation of peace agreements in mitigating FID and its far-reaching
consequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指数贴现模型在行为经济学中存在局限性，需要一种能够检测偏离该模型的方法，同时不依赖效用函数的参数假设并允许异质性

Method: 采用显示偏好方法学，无需对效用函数做任何参数假设，允许无限制的异质性，使用结账扫描仪的纵向数据进行实证分析

Result: 该方法能够有效识别偏离指数贴现的行为模式，并提供关于偏离来源的深入见解

Conclusion: 提出的新表示方法和效率度量为行为经济学中时间偏好研究提供了有力的分析工具，特别适用于检测和解释偏离标准贴现模型的行为

Abstract: This paper derives a novel representation of the exponential discounting
model that allows one to assess departures from the model via a measure of
efficiency. The approach uses a revealed preference methodology that does not
make any parametric assumption on the utility function and allows for
unrestricted heterogeneity. The method is illustrated using longitudinal data
from checkout scanners and gives insights into sources of departure from
exponential discounting.

*Sarang Shah*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态化的微观经济学模型构建方法，通过将静态模型转换为信号基础的动态系统，以更好地描述时间依赖现象和路径依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统经济学模型主要关注静态均衡，忽视了时间因素的重要性，导致无法有效地描述路径依赖性等时间相关现象，也限制了模型结果与实证观察的可比性。

Method: 使用信号基础的动态化方法，从传统静态模型出发，将效用函数作为消费的动力源，并在经典的罗宾森消费模型中进行实证。最终将动态模型表达为拉格朗日和哈密顿形式。

Result: 成功将静态模型转换为动态系统，得到了可以用拉格朗日和哈密顿方法表述的动态模型。这种动态化方法为科学迭代提供了替代的机械论基础。

Conclusion: 动态化的微观经济学模型方法能够提供与静态方法不同的解释视角，更好地描述经济现象中的时间依赖性和路径依赖性，为经济学研究提供了更丰富的分析工具。

Abstract: Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a
second-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers
may neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g.
path-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model
results with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic,
signals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static
models. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic "desert island" Robinson
Crusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I
then move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force
on consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be
expressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a
recipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations,
and the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to
employing a static approach to modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在验证机制的情况下，社会学习过程中虚假信息级联如何形成和打破，探索信息验证成本和社会压力对集体决策的影响。

Method: 建立序贯社会学习模型，代理人观察公开历史、接收私人信号、可选择付费验证声明（仅在声明为真时成功），并可披露或隐藏证据。分析二元和连续行动设置下的均衡行为。

Result: 在二元基准中推导出调查临界点，证明其相对于经典级联带的位置决定级联可打破性；连续行动中粗粒度观察和从众压力会重建级联，但偶尔的披露会使其崩溃。

Conclusion: 提出了一个可处理的"韧性边界"概念，具有透明的比较静态和政策杠杆，为理解和管理社会学习过程中的信息级联提供了理论框架。

Abstract: We study sequential social learning when agents can sometimes pay to verify a
claim and obtain hard, publicly checkable evidence. Each agent observes the
public history, receives a private signal, may investigate at a cost
(succeeding only when the claim is true), and can disclose or conceal any
proof. Actions are binary or continuous, with a conformity pull toward the
prevailing consensus. We characterize when false cascades persist and when
societies self-correct. In the binary benchmark, we derive an investigation
cutoff and show how its location relative to classic cascade bands governs
breakability; a simple knife-edge condition guarantees that any wrong cascade
at the boundary is overturned with positive probability. With continuous
actions, coarse observation and conformity can recreate cascades, yet
occasional disclosures collapse them. These forces yield a tractable
"resilience frontier" with transparent comparative statics and policy levers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在只有购买行为公开、买家获得私人信号的市场中，长期卖家如何选择成本高昂的质量投资，以及声誉机制如何影响市场效率

Method: 建立动态声誉模型，采用马尔可夫选择方法，分析信念如何分裂为两个级联区域和一个投资区域，研究信号精度、定价灵活性和信息披露对投资行为的影响

Result: 发现政策在声誉上呈倒U型，产生两种模式：早期解决（快速吸收到乐观级联）和双峰模式（两个投资阶段）。更高信号精度可能扩大级联并减少投资。灵活定价可以保持行动信息性并消除级联，公开结果披露可以扩大投资

Conclusion: 市场设计工具如灵活定价和结果披露可以显著改善声誉机制的有效性，保持行动的信息性并促进卖家投资，对于耐心卖家尤其重要

Abstract: We study a dynamic reputation model with a fixed posted price where only
purchases are public. A long-lived seller chooses costly quality; each buyer
observes the purchase history and a private signal. Under a Markov selection,
beliefs split into two cascades - where actions are unresponsive and investment
is zero - and an interior region where the seller invests. The policy is
inverse-U in reputation and produces two patterns: Early Resolution (rapid
absorption at the optimistic cascade) and Double Hump (two investment
episodes). Higher signal precision at fixed prices enlarges cascades and can
reduce investment. We compare welfare and analyze two design levers: flexible
pricing, which can keep actions informative and remove cascades for patient
sellers, and public outcome disclosure, which makes purchases more informative
and expands investment.

Motivation: 研究顾问在观察项目复杂度后设置通过阈值时，代理人如何解读这一信号并选择努力水平，比较天真制度（阈值无信息）和复杂制度（阈值作为信号）的效果差异

Method: 建立理论模型分析两种信息制度下的均衡阈值策略，使用统一能力分布、指数复杂度分布和幂成本函数作为基准案例，提供显式参数区域划分均衡类型

Result: 最优阈值随复杂度增加而上升，给出了分离、混同和半分离均衡的充分条件，标准精炼消除了大多数混同均衡，得到了透明的比较静态和跨制度福利比较

Conclusion: 阈值作为信号对代理人努力选择有重要影响，复杂制度下的信息传递能够产生不同的均衡结果和福利效应，为顾问策略设计提供了理论指导

Abstract: A benevolent advisor observes a project's complexity and posts a pass - fail
threshold before the agent chooses effort. The project succeeds only if ability
and effort together clear complexity. We compare two informational regimes. In
the naive regime, the threshold is treated as non-informative; in the
sophisticated regime, the threshold is a signal and the agent updates beliefs.
We characterize equilibrium threshold policies and show that the optimal
threshold rises with complexity under mild regularity. We then give
primitives-based sufficient conditions that guarantee separating, pooling, or
semi-separating outcomes. In a benchmark with uniform ability, exponential
complexity, and power costs, we provide explicit parameter regions that
partition the space by equilibrium type; a standard refinement eliminates most
pooling. The results yield transparent comparative statics and welfare
comparisons across regimes.

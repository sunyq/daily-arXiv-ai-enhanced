However, synchronizing these two modalities remains a\nsignificant challenge due to temporal and spatial inaccuracies in manually\nrecorded event timestamps.

To address this issue, we propose ELASTIC\n(Event-Location-AgnoSTIC synchronizer), a synchronization framework that only\nuses features derived from tracking data. ELASTIC also explicitly detects the\nend times of pass-like events and separates the detection of major and minor\nevents, which improves the completeness of the synchronized output and reduces\nerror cascade across events.

Prior studies demonstrate that when explicit\ninstructions--such as docstrings--are provided, these models can generate\nhighly accurate implementations. However, in real-world repositories, such\nannotations are frequently absent, and performance drops substantially without\nthem. To address this gap, we frame the task as a three-stage process. The\nfirst stage focuses on intent inference, where the model analyzes the code\npreceding the target function to uncover cues about the desired functionality.\nSuch preceding context often encodes subtle but critical information, and we\ndesign a reasoning-based prompting framework to guide the LLM through\nstep-by-step extraction and synthesis of these signals before any code is\ngenerated. The second stage introduces an optional interactive refinement\nmechanism to handle cases where preceding context alone is insufficient for\nintent recovery. In this stage, the model proposes a small set of candidate\nintentions, enabling the developer to select or edit them so that the inferred\nintent closely matches the actual requirement.

In this paper, we\nextend the classical concept of the stable set and its major variants -\nspecifically, the extended stable set, the socially stable set, and the $m$-\nand $w$-stable sets - within the framework of irreflexive binary relations over\ninfinite sets of alternatives.

The recent\nsuccess of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs raises the question of how to deploy\nthem efficiently, considering their underlying structure. During the inference\nin MoE LLMs, only a small part of the experts is selected to process a given\ntoken. Moreover, in practice, the experts' load is highly imbalanced. For\nefficient deployment, one has to distribute the model across a large number of\nservers using a model placement algorithm.

This work focuses on the efficient topology-aware placement of the\npre-trained MoE LLMs in the inference stage.

This study introduces and evaluates a Human-AI Hybrid Delphi\n(HAH-Delphi) framework designed to augment expert consensus development by\nintegrating a generative AI model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), small panels of senior\nhuman experts, and structured facilitation. The HAH-Delphi was tested in three\nphases: retrospective replication, prospective comparison, and applied\ndeployment in two applied domains (endurance training and resistance and mixed\ncardio/strength training). The AI replicated 95% of published expert consensus\nconclusions in Phase I and showed 95% directional agreement with senior human\nexperts in Phase II, though it lacked experiential and pragmatic nuance. In\nPhase III, compact panels of six senior experts achieved >90% consensus\ncoverage and reached thematic saturation before the final participant. The AI\nprovided consistent, literature-grounded scaffolding that supported divergence\nresolution and accelerated saturation. The HAH-Delphi framework offers a\nflexible, scalable approach for generating high-quality, context-sensitive\nconsensus.

In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces\ncomputational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part\nof the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08PFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\uff08FER\uff09\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u4e14\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u4e2d\u6027\u8868\u60c5\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08SFDA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u60c5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e2d\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9002\u5e94\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\u3002", "result": "PFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "PFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684SFDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec5\u542b\u4e2d\u6027\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings\nacross different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate\nsignificant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then\npropose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces\ninter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For\neach pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the\nK-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully\nunsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the\ndispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment\ntowards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a\nmore stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical\nmotivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate\nsystem bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge\nrating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation\nwith human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly\nperforming judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more\nrobust and reliable evaluation ecosystem.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a\nserious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of\nharmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success\nrates, many responses classified as \"successful\" are actually benign, vague, or\nunrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that\nconsiders input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output\nharmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective\njailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:\nhighly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those\nthat are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.\nHowever, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade\nfilters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a\nrecursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).\nThe approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned\nsub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the\ninputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source\nMLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful\noutputs, and fewer refusals.

However, existing approaches manifest two critical\nlimitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when\npersistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during\ndensity control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that\nprevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of\nGaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to\nredundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases\nmemory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present\nGradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware\nadaptive density control framework to address these challenges.

Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and\ndiverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,\nsuch as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing\ngenerative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and\nanatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can\neffectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,\nhighlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor\nsynthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging.

However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs. Interestingly, we find that the success rate of our method scales with\nthe attack compute budget - as we increase the number of sequences generated\nfrom the target model conditioned on the prefix, attack performance tends to\nimprove. Having verified the accuracy of our method, we use it to investigate\npreviously unstudied closed OpenAI models on multiple domains.

However, few works have noted the negative effects on SLM\nsafety brought by the training, which are revealed in this study. Although\nthere are works on safety alignment that fine-tune language models or\nmanipulate model weights to defend against harmful inputs, they require extra\ncomputation or annotated data, and probably impact the reasoning ability of\nSLMs. In this paper, we investigate how to maintain the safety of SLMs during\nthe CoT distillation process. Specifically, we propose a safe distillation\nmethod, Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking Distillation (SLowED), containing\ntwo modules: Slow Tuning and Low-Entropy Masking. Slow Tuning scales down the\nmagnitude of model weight changes to optimize the model weights in the\nneighboring space near the initial weight distribution. Low-Entropy Masking\nmasks low-entropy tokens, which are regarded as unnecessary learning targets,\nto exclude them from fine-tuning. Experiments on three SLMs (Qwen2.5-1.5B,\nLlama-3.2-1B, BLOOM-1.1B) across reasoning benchmarks (BBH, BB-Sub, ARC,\nAGIEval) and safety evaluation (AdvBench) show that SLowED retains the safety\nof SLMs and comparably improves their reasoning capability compared to existing\ndistillation methods.

Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new\nAnimated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of\nAnimate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images.

Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from\nimproving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to\ngenerating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with\nmathematical guarantees.

This performance metric has\nbecome critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI\nadoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the\nneuromorphic computing paradigm.

In this work, we address this gap by\nsystematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on\nthe task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We\nalso investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed\nabstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific\nvocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models\nare trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance\ndifferences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve\nthe most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory\nrequirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences.

To address these, we present two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically\ncombines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to\ncapture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to\nmitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline\ncentered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this\npipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from\nexisting open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with\nannotated facial angles.

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "SkySplat\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06RPC\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5165\u901a\u75283DGS\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0eRPC\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SkySplat\u7ed3\u5408RPC\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165CSCM\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "SkySplat\u6bd4EOGS\u5feb86\u500d\u4e14\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5728DFC19\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aMAE\u4ece13.18m\u964d\u81f31.80m\u3002", "conclusion": "SkySplat\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Furthermore,\nthe framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to\niteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic\nmemories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.\nExtensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench\nbenchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly\ncompetitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective\nbaselines while utilizing fewer frames.", "AI": {"tldr": "Video-EM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Video-LLMs\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u68c0\u7d22\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u573a\u666f\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "Video-EM\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u60c5\u666f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b5b\u9009\u6700\u5c0f\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVideo-EM\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53474-9%\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u5e27\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "Video-EM\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, current\nmulti-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing\nintra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting\nenvironments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured\nat a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under\ncomplex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure\nCorrection method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we\nintroduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment\nModule (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure\nconsistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses\nmiscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to\nrecognize 'blurred' exposure degradation.

We\nperformed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,\nscalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11\nclinicians.

To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via\ndiagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language\nmodel with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a\ndiagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated\nsentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding\nmodule is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the\nworking efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we\npropose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to\nleverage various types of annotations from different datasets.

Recently, latent\ndiffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable\nresults. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail\npreservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic\ndatasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to\ncapture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization\ncapabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting\ninformation from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach\npreserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,\ngenerating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model\nR2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in\nthe foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.\nTo further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with\nMask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the\nforeground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background\nregions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random\nPoisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a\nsuitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and\nchallenging synthetic images.

To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation.

While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections.

Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and\nunclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for\nfine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast\nFusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed\ninformation from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower\nlayers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By\nassigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast\nconditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining\nminimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature\nrepresentation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports\nclinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating\nstrong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening.

In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective\napproach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal\nmodifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,\nwe synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each\nTransformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the\npre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and\ndynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy\ntransfer from base to novel classes.

We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image\nrestoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants\nof ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,\nrespectively.

After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,\nto tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we\nstrengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this\ninformation in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x\n16 x 16 discrete VAEs.

This\nhelps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and\nexpression.

To address\nthese issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.\nHowever, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)\nCurrent approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,\nhindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)\nEvaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance\nin realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,\nwithout exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce\nLLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,\nplug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five\nrepresentative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and\nmodel-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal\nredundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods\ndegrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)\nCombining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal\nperformance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire\nfuture research in efficient VLM.

Existing methods narrowly focus on subject\nidentity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial\ncomposition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we\nintroduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:\nLatent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across\npanels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual\nfeatures between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these\nmechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,\nenabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet\nconsistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf\nlanguage model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.\nTo evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain\nnarratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded\nstorytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene\nDiversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.\nOur qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that\nStory2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging\nstoryboards than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Story2Board\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u4e3b\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u56fe\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8282\u594f\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6f5c\u5728\u9762\u677f\u951a\u5b9a\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e92\u60e0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u6df7\u5408\uff08\u8f6f\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9762\u677f\u7ea7\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Rich Storyboard Benchmark\u548cScene Diversity\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\uff0cStory2Board\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u53d9\u4e8b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "Story2Board\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u677f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

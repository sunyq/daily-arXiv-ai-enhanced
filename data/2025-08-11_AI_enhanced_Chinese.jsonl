Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions. This requires a precise spatial alignment, which\naccurately locates the coordinates of each element, and, more critically, a\ncorrect semantic alignment, which matches the instructions to the functionally\nappropriate UI element. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework.

Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains\nunderexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on\nsimilarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly\nlimits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool\nretrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and\ntheir functional dependencies.

Cognitive Appraisal Analysis of Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Affective Computing has been established as a crucial field of inquiry to\nadvance the holistic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.\nFoundation models -- especially Large Language Models (LLMs) -- have been\nevaluated, trained, or instruction-tuned in several past works, to become\nbetter predictors or generators of emotion. Most of these studies, however,\napproach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training\nthe capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli\n(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have\noften been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as\nthe recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond\nsurface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions\nthrough cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we\nexamine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when\nreasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale\nbenchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal\ncognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a\nplethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are\nmodels more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal\ndimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing\nspecific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different\nemotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal\ndimensions?

A significant\nchallenge in this domain arises from the inherent discrepancies between topics.\nWhile existing methods predominantly focus on extracting topic-shared features\nthrough distribution alignment of source and target topics, they often neglect\ntopic-specific features, limiting their ability to assess critical traits such\nas topic adherence. To address this limitation, we propose an Adversarial\nTOpic-aware Prompt-tuning (ATOP), a novel method that jointly learns\ntopic-shared and topic-specific features to improve cross-topic AES. ATOP\nachieves this by optimizing a learnable topic-aware prompt--comprising both\nshared and specific components--to elicit relevant knowledge from pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs). To enhance the robustness of topic-shared prompt\nlearning and mitigate feature scale sensitivity introduced by topic alignment,\nwe incorporate adversarial training within a unified regression and\nclassification framework.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced\nvision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for\ninteractive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate\ndiverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and\ncyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input\ndescriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK\n2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects\nrequired in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via\nstate-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios.

However,\nexisting white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and\nstudent-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training\ndata quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation\nframework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically\nrefine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both.

To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware\nSemantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)\nAutomatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling\ncross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic\nanchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional\naffordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning\nbenchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's\neffectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,\nachieving performance comparable to manual annotations.

However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed\nscenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains\nchallenging.

Another challenge is that the human and the background may\nexhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In\naddition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera\nmovements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a\nspecified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues\nin a unified framework.

Second, we propose a\ntraining-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to\nmatch the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual\nintegration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the\n4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,\nenabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera\nmovements.

It proposes an interpretable\nbias detection method aimed at identifying hidden social biases in model\noutputs, especially those semantic tendencies that are not easily captured\nthrough explicit linguistic features. The method combines nested semantic\nrepresentation with a contextual contrast mechanism. It extracts latent bias\nfeatures from the vector space structure of model outputs. Using attention\nweight perturbation, it analyzes the model's sensitivity to specific social\nattribute terms, thereby revealing the semantic pathways through which bias is\nformed. To validate the effectiveness of the method, this study uses the\nStereoSet dataset, which covers multiple stereotype dimensions including\ngender, profession, religion, and race. The evaluation focuses on several key\nmetrics, such as bias detection accuracy, semantic consistency, and contextual\nsensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong\ndetection performance across various dimensions. It can accurately identify\nbias differences between semantically similar texts while maintaining high\nsemantic alignment and output stability.

A key technique in merging methods is sparsification, which\nprunes redundant parameters from task vectors to mitigate interference.\nHowever, prevailing approaches employ a ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy,\napplying a uniform sparsity ratio that overlooks the inherent structural and\nstatistical heterogeneity of model parameters. This often leads to a suboptimal\ntrade-off, where critical parameters are inadvertently pruned while less useful\nones are retained. To address this limitation, we introduce \\textbf{TADrop}\n(\\textbf{T}ensor-wise \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{Drop}), an adaptive\nsparsification strategy that respects this heterogeneity. Instead of a global\nratio, TADrop assigns a tailored sparsity level to each parameter tensor based\non its distributional properties. The core intuition is that tensors with\ndenser, more redundant distributions can be pruned aggressively, while sparser,\nmore critical ones are preserved. As a simple and plug-and-play module, we\nvalidate TADrop by integrating it with foundational, classic, and SOTA merging\nmethods. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks (vision, language, and\nmultimodal) and models (ViT, BEiT) demonstrate that TADrop consistently and\nsignificantly boosts their performance.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation.

We systematically classify the real images into three\nprimary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and\nirrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14\nsubcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability\ncategories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three\ndifficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical\nreasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we\ndesign six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their\nperformance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the\nproblem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in\nrealistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis\nof their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their\nrecognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining\ndirections for future improvements.

(3)\nSceneJailEval achieves state-of-the-art results, with an F1 score of 0.917 on\nour full-scenario dataset (+6% over prior SOTA) and 0.995 on JBB (+3% over\nprior SOTA), surpassing accuracy limits of existing evaluation methods in\nheterogeneous scenarios and confirming its advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "SceneJailEval\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d8a\u72f1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6SceneJailEval\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b14\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "SceneJailEval\u5728\u5168\u9762\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.917\uff08\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u63d0\u53476%\uff09\uff0c\u5728JBB\u4e0a\u4e3a0.995\uff08\u63d0\u53473%\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SceneJailEval\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d8a\u72f1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for\nparticle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as\nsilicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining\nlarge numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively\nstraightforward.

Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but\ntypically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to\ndistinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe\nthat, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D\ntexture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling\nstronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract\nhuman-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate\nsemantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through\nprompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation\nmaps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone\ngarments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene.

Despite recent\nadvances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:\n\\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and\n\\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in\nreal-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video\nquality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.\nSpecifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided\nreinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality\nunder score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a\n\\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction\nerror decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;\n(2) a \\textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly\ndetermine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \\textbf{temporal\nconsistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent\nvideos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "VQAThinker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08GRPO\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u56de\u5f52\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "VQAThinker\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u6570\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes.

We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a\npowerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to\nsimultaneously capture both ``salient\" and ``camouflaged\". Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our\nproposed method.

Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training.

Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains.

We propose\na pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy\ntarget morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an\nisotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation\n(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label\ncustom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to\ngenerate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In\ncontrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,\nour approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes\ncompatible for pre- and intraoperative use.

To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a\nunified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We\npropose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.\nThis offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models\nare more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better\nvideo editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and\naligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data\nsynthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data\nsynthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and\nbackgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,\nbackground changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of\naccurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE\non extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing\ntypes and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,\ncollage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative\ndrop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite\nbeing hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.\nTherefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.\nBesides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE.

Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training.

The\nprogressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly\nrobust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving\nstructural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised\npretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)\nsupervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.\nExtensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the\neffectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER\nperformance.

However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity.

This paper proposes a diffusion-based\nsolution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals\ntogether seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the\ncharacteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is\nconsidered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the\ninertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to\nconstruct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that\nthe visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or\nsubjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential\nvisual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the\noccasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other\nhand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when\nsignal transmission has no problem.

To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments\non the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior\nperformance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of\nright-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD\nprogression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMPF-KANSC\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u878d\u5408\u548cKANSC\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "AD\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u56e0\u8111\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u75c5\u7406\u533a\u57df\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u878d\u5408\uff08MPF\uff09\u548cKANSC\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5e73\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "result": "\u5728ADNI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MPF-KANSC\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0AD\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e2d\u53f3\u504f\u4fa7\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "MPF-KANSC\u5728AD\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of\nExperts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each\nspecialized in capturing specific anomaly types.

This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the\nfidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to\nboost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing\nper-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of\ndenoising steps.

To address\nthe inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for\ninterpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.\nOur approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using\nattention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for\nprediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles\nmost likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing\ndisease-relevant joints.

While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2.

It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise.

This\nchallenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,\nwhere performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve\nincreasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or\nadditional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.\nSynthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural\nconsistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in\ncreating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)\ntrained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that\nresemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural\nfidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the\nsegmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in\nmulti-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and\nvanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,\ndomain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain\ndata, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the\nsource domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation\nperformance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based\nmetrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on\nreal data alone.

This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into\nforeground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned\nmembership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the\nsegmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be\nsummarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are\nsmooth.

Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions.

Nevertheless,\ngenerative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input\nimage do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be\ninferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar\nrelighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or\noutperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting\nsynthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "LightSwitch\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6750\u6599\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6750\u6599\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67092D\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLightSwitch\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u6750\u6599\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "LightSwitch\u57282D\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "LightSwitch\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

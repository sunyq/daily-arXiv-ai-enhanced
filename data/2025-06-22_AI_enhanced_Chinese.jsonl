SimBank\nadditionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,\nit can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not\npossible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel\nactivities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely\nresemble real-life process instances.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use\nagents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test\nmodels across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt\ninjection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150\ntasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright\ninfringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to\ninteract with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,\netc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and\nsafety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and\n0.79 F1 score).

They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined.

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,\ndata analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of\ntheir accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect\nvisualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information\nconveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual\nbugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause\nobvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data\ngraphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good\nunderstanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is\nessential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz\nlibraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz\nlibraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques.

During training,\nthese approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which\nare merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it\nallows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to\nlow-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this\nproblem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained\nand unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model\n$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak\npredictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the\ntwo weak predictions into one final prediction.

Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,\nmodifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning\nchallenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text\nsurface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We\nanalyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that\nMDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively\nshort document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)\nallows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning\ncapabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and\nfuture modeling improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MDBench\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u521b\u5efa\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6587\u6863\u96c6\u548c\u95ee\u7b54\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u5728LLM\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8f83\u5c11\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u79cd\u5b50\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u8f91\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u6587\u672c\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "MDBench\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709LLM\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u5747\u6784\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "MDBench\u4e3a\u591a\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Serving\nthese models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes\nstatic weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights\nare constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV\ncaches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for\nefficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle\nruntime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory\nmanagement relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a\npage table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction.\nThis virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory\nfragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime\nmemory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization\nunder dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.\n  To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management\nframework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating\nsystems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction,\nwhich decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU\nmemory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory\nMechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory\ninflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3)\na Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize\nmemory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under\nstringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding\nthroughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "eLLM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f39\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5b58\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548cKV\u7f13\u5b58\uff09\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u7ba1\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "eLLM\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u62df\u5f20\u91cf\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u5f39\u6027\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528CPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002", "result": "eLLM\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53472.32\u500d\uff0c\u652f\u6301128K-token\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u52a03\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "eLLM\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, due to ongoing explorations\nin the LLM-based unit testing field, it is challenging for researchers to\nunderstand existing achievements, open challenges, and future opportunities.\nThis paper presents the first systematic literature review on the application\nof LLMs in unit testing until March 2025.

We then discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs\ninto unit testing research, including model usage, adaptation strategies, and\nhybrid approaches. We further summarize key challenges that remain unresolved\nand outline promising directions to guide future research in this area.\nOverall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to\nthe unit testing community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of achievements and promote future research.

We\nsystematically analyze these models across multiple dimensions: architectural\nfoundations, performance characteristics, domain-specific suitability,\nprogramming complexity, and recent advancements. We examine each model's\nstrengths, weaknesses, and optimization techniques. Our investigation\ndemonstrates that MPI excels in distributed memory environments with\nnear-linear scalability for communication-intensive applications, but faces\ncommunication overhead challenges. OpenMP provides strong performance and\nusability in shared-memory systems and loop-centric tasks, though it is limited\nby shared memory contention. CUDA offers substantial performance gains for\ndata-parallel GPU workloads, but is restricted to NVIDIA GPUs and requires\nspecialized expertise. Performance evaluations across scientific simulations,\nmachine learning, and data analytics reveal that hybrid approaches combining\ntwo or more models often yield optimal results in heterogeneous environments.\nThe paper also discusses implementation challenges, optimization best\npractices, and emerging trends such as performance portability frameworks,\ntask-based programming, and the convergence of HPC and Big Data.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods\nof state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the\nextent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward\ninformativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes\nrewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,\nthe extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it\nadmits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments\n\\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find\nthat there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language\nstate representation. In particular, we observe that representations which\nprovide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language\nrepresentations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw\npayoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior\nthat more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more\nstable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit\neither large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play\nover time, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91cd\u590d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u65f6\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u603b\u7ed3\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u63d0\u4f9b\u540e\u6094\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u9650\u5236\u4ed6\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5747\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5747\u8861\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While DETR-like architectures offer a\npowerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent\nlimitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these\nchallenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally\nadvance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.\nFirst, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the\nintegration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves\nthe stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization\nobjective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to\naddress the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which\nseverely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly\nintroduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and\nunlock substantial performance gains.

Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided\narchitectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent\nreduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.\nTwo real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical\nimage classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign\nrecognition on edge devices.

These results show that kernel size can be an\nactive, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic.

Under review for NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach\nPeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy\ndesigned to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving\nlearning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce\npermutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to\nexplore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout\nfiltering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute\nmost to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We\nevaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image\nbenchmarks.

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods\ndirectly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced\nby inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency\ndetail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a\nFrequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical\nimage diffusion models.

Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images.

However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text.

This framework is designed to\nrevolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven\nstylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that\nuses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of\nthe style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove\nstyle-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap.\nThis gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free\ninjection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy\nbased on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in\nthe fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive\nlearning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a\ntraining-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which\nmanipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the\ncross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and\nvalue of the content-related process are replaced with those of the\nstyle-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the\nmodel. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the\noriginal content.

Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in\nechocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.\nHowever, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and\nambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise\ndiffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a\nunique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a\nmulti-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.\nFurthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial\nintegrity in segmentation masks.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The\nexperimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the\nproposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation\nmetrics.

In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by\ngrounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work\nhas shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure\ngrounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding\nSupervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained\nwith relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only\nover the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both\ntextual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's\nLLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four\nbenchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.\nThis improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream\nperformance.

However, due to their semantic\nobscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.\nExisting methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the\nassociations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit\nemotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,\nwe propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based\non bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis\nmodule deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.\nNext, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source\ndomains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole\nand metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the\nmutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor.

Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of\njust 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across\ndiverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear\nattention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context\nperformance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements\ndo not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel\nimplementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training\nspeeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "RATTENTION\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ffd\u7565\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRATTENTION\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u57283B\u548c12B\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRATTENTION\u4ee5512\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u5339\u914d\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "RATTENTION\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

Current approaches typically\nmerge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing\nphenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and\ndegraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new\ntask, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our\ndataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised\nmulti-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9\nsentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in\nexisting datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS\nimproves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,\nhigh inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and\nsmaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose\nDiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a\nsecond PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation\noverhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE\nby approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster\ninference than GPT-4.

Training high-performance models for this\ntask typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution\nby iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby\nreducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the\nassumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to\ntarget classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often\ncontains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low\nefficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing\nAL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a\nsignificant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for\npathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language\nModel (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine\ntarget and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select\nIn-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In\nsubsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes\nPrototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic\nSampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a\nquery, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public\npathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's\nperformance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

To enhance the quality of generated 4D\nHOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to\nextract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention\nto effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.\nExperimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the\npublicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI\ngeneration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenHOI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u76844D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a214D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b34D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528Object-AnchorNet\u91cd\u5efa\u7a00\u758f3D\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7ContactDM\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c64D\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728OMOMO\u548c3D-FUTURE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GenHOI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864D HOI\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

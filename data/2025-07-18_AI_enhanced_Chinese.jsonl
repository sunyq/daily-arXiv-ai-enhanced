It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no\nrational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce\nauxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal\ndiscounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve\nmathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually\nperceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative\napproach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse\npartitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are\ngrouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a\nrepresentative element of its group before being added. This method allows for\na phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a\nbehavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as\na definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a\nplausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might\nhandle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg\nseries can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed\npartition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral\nmodeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c97\u7cd9\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u52a0\u6cd5\u8fd0\u7b97\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5723\u5f7c\u5f97\u5821\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u503c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u5e76\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u5143\u7d20\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\"\u60ef\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u53d1\u6563\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5723\u5f7c\u5f97\u5821\u6096\u8bba\u662f\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u7528\u9012\u51cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6298\u6263\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u5b66\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6570\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7c97\u7cd9\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u52a0\u6cd5\u8fd0\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c06\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5206\u7ec4\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u503c\u5728\u52a0\u6cd5\u8fd0\u7b97\u524d\u88ab\u5176\u6240\u5c5e\u7ec4\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u5143\u7d20\u66ff\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\"\u60ef\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u91cd\u590d\u52a0\u6cd5\u6700\u7ec8\u4e0d\u518d\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6784\u9020\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4e0b\uff0c\u5723\u5f7c\u5f97\u5821\u7ea7\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c97\u7cd9\u52a0\u6cd5\u8fd0\u7b97\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u60f0\u6027\uff08\u4e0d\u518d\u589e\u957f\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u53d1\u6563\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u5723\u5f7c\u5f97\u5821\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design\nthat uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,\nand loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us.

The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u7684\u2018\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u2019\uff08MSA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u7c7b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65b0\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMSA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "MSA\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u9896\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "MSA\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u590d\u5236\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The\nexperimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling\nmethod significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low\nload and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource\nutilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource\nconditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve\noptimized resource scheduling.

Flattening the database poses challenges for deep learning models\nthat rely on fixed-size input representations to capture relational semantics\nfrom the structured nature of relational data. Graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational\nstructures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring\nintra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nframework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair\nas a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained\nintra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level\nrepresentations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the\nscalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a\nsplit-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for\nefficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both classification and regression tasks.

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u533a\u5206\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LMs\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u8d28\u7591\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9LMs\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f4e\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22LMs\u5185\u90e8\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522bLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LMs\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LMs\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models,\ndemonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing\ndebugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based\napproaches.

To address these\nchallenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a\npre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data\nvia delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09Mono-InternVL\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7248Mono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u7801\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMono-InternVL\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u6e90\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08EViP\uff09\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3aMono-InternVL-1.5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08EViP++\uff09\u3002", "result": "Mono-InternVL\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u768412\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982OCRBench\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347114\u5206\uff09\uff1bMono-InternVL-1.5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "Mono-InternVL\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001MLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Natural language processing (NLP) models may\nautomate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been\nlimited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in\n2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was\nconducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.\nMultiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug\ninvolvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included\ntraditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned\nencoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large\nlanguage models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed\nusing macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to\nquantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect\nperformance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External\nvalidation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional\nmachine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large\nlanguage models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like\nBioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose\ndeath classification from free-text reports.

This extends the concept of\nage of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange,\ncapturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own\nrepresentation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities\nshare about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model,\nwe derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a\ntransmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies.

Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

This process\nhas led to the development of new information and data models when the existing\nones fall short. To prevent potential disruptions caused by flaws in the newly\ndesigned information and data models, it is essential to evaluate them during\nthe design process before they are implemented in operation.\n  Currently, general explicit evaluation approaches outside the smart grid\ndomain stay at a high level without defining clear steps. Meanwhile, implicit\nevaluation approaches in the smart grid domain focus on testing systems that\nutilise information and data models already in use for functionality in terms\nof conformance and interoperability. Notably, no combination of explicit and\nimplicit evaluation approaches for newly designed information and data models\noffers a clearly defined set of steps during their design process in the smart\ngrid context.\n  Consequently, we design a three-phase evaluation approach using design\nscience research to address this gap.

Since there\ncould be an exponential number of object-action combinations, labeled data is\nlimited - leading to a long-tail distribution problem. Recently, zero-shot\nlearning emerged as a solution, with end-to-end transformer-based object\ndetectors adapted for HOID becoming successful frameworks. However, their\nprimary focus is designing improved decoders for learning entangled or\ndisentangled interpretations of interactions.

Consequently, we build a top-down framework named Funnel-HOI\ninspired by the human tendency to grasp well-defined concepts first and then\nassociate them with abstract concepts during scene understanding. We first\nprobe an image for the presence of objects (well-defined concepts) and then\nprobe for actions (abstract concepts) associated with them.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved.

Previous studies have generally not integrated retinal\nmicrovasculature characteristics with comprehensive serum lipidomic profiles as\npotential indicators of CVD risk. In this study, an innovative imaging omics\nframework was introduced, combining retinal microvascular traits derived\nthrough deep learning based image processing with serum lipidomic data to\nhighlight asymptomatic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk beyond the\nconventional lipid panel. This represents the first large scale, covariate\nadjusted and stratified correlation analysis conducted in a healthy population,\nwhich is essential for identifying early indicators of disease. Retinal\nphenotypes were quantified using automated image analysis tools, while serum\nlipid profiling was performed by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography\nElectrospray ionization High resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC ESI HRMS).\nStrong, age- and sex-independent correlations were established, particularly\nbetween average artery width, vessel density, and lipid subclasses such as\ntriacylglycerols (TAGs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), and ceramides (Cers). These\nassociations suggest a converging mechanism of microvascular remodeling under\nmetabolic stress. By linking detailed\n  vascular structural phenotypes to specific lipid species, this study fills a\ncritical gap in the understanding of early CVD pathogenesis.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises\nseveral new challenges. On the one hand, issues such as the regulation of code\nprovenance, copyright disputes, and code quality have become increasingly\nconcerning. How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its\ncompliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the\nother hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to\nmanual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.\nAlthough some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods\nfor detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness\nwhen facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective\nsolution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may\nundergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of\nCodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against\ninput perturbations.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7528\u6237\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c8\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u8017\u610f\u8bc6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "GEA\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u8017\u610f\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work, we\nextend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a\nstate-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality\nassessment.

Also, we\nrelax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document\nimages. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the\nperformance.

Fortunately,\nfoundation models, pre-trained on vast open-world datasets, demonstrate strong\npotential for this task due to their generalizable representation, which\npromotes the development of adaptive strategies on pre-trained models in\nlong-tailed learning. Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual\nencoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,\noverlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we\npropose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for\nlong-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance\nderived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.\nSpecifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as\nsemantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder. The\nintroduced guidance is passesed through the attention mechanism and enables the\nmodel to focus more on semantically relevant content, strengthening the\nalignment between the visual and textual modalities. Due to the inconsistent\nclass-conditional distributions neglected by the existing loss function, the\nresulting prediction bias causes performance improvements for the tail class\nless than for the head class, even when the multi-modal alignment is enhanced.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel distribution mismatch-aware\ncompensation factor, which is specifically designed to rectify the prediction\nbias caused by the ignored inconsistent distribution based on our theoretical\nanalysis, and is seamlessly integrated into the loss function.

Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data.

Estimating model performance\nwithout ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient\nrobustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an\nexpression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations\nto capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to\nrender fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked\ncross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression\ngeneration, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in\nthis area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are\nspecifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating\nmulti-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both\nquantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in\nchallenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

The absence of ground truths for\nunknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have\naddressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently\nproposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB)\nis a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown\nobjects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces\nissues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions.\n  To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel\nmodel, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of\nObjectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate\nlayers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and\nobjectness predictions in PROB.

Intra-voxel incoherent motion analysis has shown\npromising results for non-invasive assessment of fetal lung development, but\nits reliance on manual segmentation is time-consuming, thus limiting its\nclinical applicability. In this work, we present an automated lung maturity\nevaluation pipeline for diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images that\nconsists of a deep learning-based fetal lung segmentation model and a\nmodel-fitting lung maturity assessment. A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on\nmanually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D\ndiffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust\nperformance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%.

As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces.

To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos.

Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.
